politics,TOKYO (AP) — A Belarus track sprinter alleged her Olympic team tried to remove her from Japan in a dispute that led to a standoff Sunday evening at Tokyo’s main airport.
politics,An activist group supporting Krystsina Tsimanouskaya said she believed her life was in danger in Belarus and would seek asylum with the Austrian embassy in Tokyo.
politics,Tsimanouskaya said in a filmed message distributed on social media she was pressured by Belarus team officials and asked the International Olympic Committee for help.
politics,"Tsimanouskaya, who is due to run in the Olympic 200-meter heats Monday, criticized Belarus team officials on her Instagram account. She said she’d been put in the 4x400 relay despite never racing the event."
politics,"“I was put under pressure and they are trying to forcibly take me out of the country without my consent,” the 24-year-old runner said."
politics,"“The campaign was quite serious and that was a clear signal that her life would be in danger in Belarus,” Alexander Opeikin, a spokesman for the BSSF, told The Associated Press in an interview."
politics,"The Belarusian Sport Solidarity Foundation said government supporters targeted the athlete, and Tsimanouskaya contacted the group for help to avoid what she feared was a forced deportation to Minsk."
politics,"Tsimanouskaya summoned Japanese police at Haneda Airport and did not board a flight departing for Istanbul. Foreign ministry officials arrived later at the airport, Opeikin said."
politics,"In a statement released by the BSSF, Tsimanouskaya said she was in a police station early Monday morning."
politics,"“I explained the situation to a police officer of how I was taken from the Olympic Village,” she said. “Now I am in a secure situation and am figuring out the question of where I will spend the night."
politics,"“The IOC … is looking into the situation and has asked the NOC for clarification,” the Olympics said in a statement."
politics,"The IOC, which has been in dispute with the Belarus National Olympic Committee ahead of the Tokyo Games, said it had intervened."
politics,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate moved closer to passing a $1 trillion infrastructure package Saturday after lawmakers from both parties came together and voted to clear a key procedural hurdle, but the action soon stalled out as opponents tried to slow the rush to approve one of President Joe Biden’s top priorities."
politics,"But momentum dragged as opponents refused to yield 30 hours of required debate before the next procedural vote, which could delay swift passage of the package and result in a dayslong slog."
politics,"The measure would provide a massive injection of federal money for a range of public works programs, from roads and bridges to broadband internet access, drinking water and more. In a rare stroke of bipartisanship, Republicans joined the Democrats to overcome the 60-vote threshold needed to advance the measure toward final votes. The vote was 67-27, a robust tally. If approved, the bill would go to the House."
politics,"Senators are meeting for a second consecutive weekend to work on the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which is the first of Biden’s two infrastructure packages. Once voting wraps up, senators immediately will turn to the next item on Biden’s agenda, the budget outline for a $3.5 trillion package of child care, elder care and other programs that is a much more partisan undertaking and expected to draw only Democratic support."
politics,Schumer has vowed to keep senators in session until they finish up the bipartisan bill and start the initial votes on the next big package.
politics,"“We can get this done the easy way or the hard way,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said as the Senate opened on Saturday."
politics,"Vice President Kamala Harris arrived on Capitol Hill for meetings on the bipartisan legislation, which Biden said offered a potentially “historic investment,” on par with the building of the transcontinental railroad or interstate highway system."
politics,Overcoming the 60-vote hurdle was a sign that the tenuous alliance between Republicans and Democrats could hold on the public works package. At least 10 Republicans had to join all Democrats to advance the measure past a filibuster — and in the end 18 Republican senators voted to advance the package.
politics,"For some Republican senators the back-to-back voting schedule is what they are trying to delay, hoping to slow or halt what appears to be a forward march by Democrats to achieve the president’s infrastructure goals."
politics,"Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has so far allowed the bill to progress, and his vote — “yes” — was closely watched. “This is a compromise,” he said before the vote."
politics,"Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., an ally of Donald Trump, who was the former president’s ambassador to Japan, was among those leading the effort for the Senate to take as much time as needed to debate and amend the bill."
politics,"“There’s absolutely no reason to rush,” Hagerty said during a floor speech Saturday."
politics,"Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who has an amendment to repurpose a portion of the untapped COVID-19 relief aid that had been sent to the states, is among those on both sides of the aisle trying to expedite the process."
politics,Congress is under pressure to make gains on the president’s infrastructure priorities — first with the bipartisan bill and then with Democrats’ more sweeping $3.5 trillion budget blueprint they plan to shoulder on their own.
politics,"Senators have spent the past week processing nearly two dozen amendments to the 2,700-page package, but so far none has substantially changed the framework of the public works package. Some senators are insisting on more amendments — including one on cryptocurrency and a longshot effort by defense hawks to add $50 billion for shipbuilding and other defense-related infrastructure."
politics,"For senators who have been slogging through debate — and months of give-and-take negotiations — the bill is a chance not only to send federal dollars to their states, but also to show the country that Congress can work together in a bipartisan way to solve problems."
politics,"Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the needs in her state were obvious — including money for water systems in remote villages without running taps for handwashing during the COVID-19 pandemic. But as one of the negotiators, she also wants to demonstrate that lawmakers can unite."
politics,"“I’m really worried that everybody believes that we’re as dysfunctional as we appear to be, and so to prove otherwise, it’s kind of important,” she said. “The Senate needs some demonstrated acts of bipartisanship.”"
politics,"Senators have found much to like in the bill, even though it does not fully satisfy liberals, who view it as too small, or conservatives, who find it too large. It would provide federal money for projects many states and cities could not afford on their own."
politics,"Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said, “America has not seen this type of infrastructure investment in 30 years.”"
politics,"Trump weighed in Saturday with a statement criticizing Biden, senators of both parties and the bill itself, though it’s not clear whether Trump’s views hold sway over the lawmakers."
politics,"An analysis of the bill from the Congressional Budget Office drew concerns, particularly from Republicans. It concluded that the legislation would increase deficits by about $256 billion over the next decade."
politics,But the bill’s backers argued that the budget office was unable to take into account certain revenue streams — including from future economic growth. Additional analysis released Saturday by the budget office suggested infrastructure spending overall could boost productivity and lower the ultimate costs.
politics,Paying for the package has been a pressure point throughout the months of negotiations after Democrats objected to an increase in the gas tax paid at the pump and Republicans resisted a plan to bolster the IRS to go after tax scofflaws.
politics,"Unlike Biden’s bigger $3.5 trillion package, which would be paid for by higher tax rates for corporations and the wealthy, the bipartisan package is funded by repurposing other money, including untapped COVID-19 aid, and other spending cuts and revenue streams."
politics,The House is in recess and is expected to consider both Biden infrastructure packages when it returns in September.

politics,You may not be very surprised to find out Barack Obama appears to have a lot of close family and friends. 
politics,"The former president’s 60th birthday party was set to proceed Saturday as a “significantly scaled back” version of the original plan given the ominous threat of the delta variant of the coronavirus, an Obama spokesperson said this week. But according to photos snapped on and above Martha’s Vineyard ― the posh New England island where the nation’s wealthiest go to be amongst their own ― “scaled back” is still looking pretty impressive. "
politics,"The newly minted sexagenarian will be feted inside a mammoth white tent nuzzled against his family’s $12 million vacation home, which sits on 30 acres of oceanfront property. Aerial shots taken Friday revealed grounds that were abuzz with caterers and party-planning staff ― although presumably fewer than the 200-plus originally expected to work the event. Sofas dotted the outdoor area in intimate clusters, while dozens of sand-colored chairs waited to be unstacked and ringed around tables."
politics,Obama himself was photographed on an island golf course Saturday morning.
politics,"On Wednesday ― his actual birthday ― former first lady Michelle Obama posted images of her husband to Instagram, writing, “Still turning my head after all these years.” "
politics,"The 44th president attracted some criticism when details of his massive party leaked this week amid the nationwide surge in COVID-19 cases. The U.S. is once again recording around 100,000 new cases on a daily basis, marking a return to levels not seen since the fall and winter. "
politics,"Still, spokesperson Hannah Hankins said Wednesday that the event would be downsized to “include only family and close friends.”"
politics,"Obama was not exactly throwing caution to the wind: He had hired a COVID-19 coordinator to verify that all attendees tested negative before the event, and had asked everybody to be fully vaccinated. The party is also largely outdoors."
politics,"The result was, apparently, some hurt feelings among former Obama administration staffers, who still noticed the likes of Chrissy Teigen and John Legend arriving on the island ahead of the main event. A “majority” of the former staffers had been uninvited, the Times said, noting that many “generally credit themselves with helping create the Obama legacy that has allowed the former president to settle in so comfortably with the A-list crowd.”"
politics,"It remains unclear what size the guest list has been whittled down to. The original plan was to welcome some 475 guests, according to Axios, but the Obama camp never confirmed that amount. At least eight aides, including Michelle Obama’s chief of staff, were tasked with making the unpleasant calls to uninvite people from the party, according to The New York Times. "
politics,"Paparazzi shots published by The Daily Mail also documented the arrivals of Dwayne Wade and Gabrielle Union, Steven Colbert and Don Cheadle. Beyoncé and Jay-Z were reportedly marked as attending, the Times reported Friday; tabloids said that they were already on the island."
politics,"Legend is expected to perform Saturday night, according to The New York Post. (Not Pearl Jam, as had been rumored.) "
politics,John Kerry ― Obama’s former secretary of state and the current administration’s special presidential envoy for climate ― was photographed arriving on Martha’s Vineyard by private jet. 
politics,"The White House previously said in a statement that President Joe Biden will not be in attendance, although he “looks forward to catching up with former President Obama soon and properly welcoming him into the over 60 club.” "
politics,"Larry David, David Letterman and Conan O’Brien were reportedly among those who were disinvited; Oprah Winfrey and Ava DuVernay bowed out on their own, according to the Times. "
politics,"With luck, the only thing guests will pick up this weekend will be the custom baseball caps Obama reportedly had made for the occasion that read, “44 at 60.”"
politics,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki ― an Obama administration alumni herself ― appeared to defend the former president’s birthday bash on Friday when asked whether Obama was setting a good example for the American people. Psaki said COVID-19 transmission in Martha’s Vineyard was considered “moderate,” meaning the area was not subject to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s updated masking guidance, which targets counties with high or substantially high transmission. (The CDC now categorizes the island as having “high” transmission, a change that appears to have come Friday, according to local reports.)"
politics,"After a few unexpected pivots, Nina West is set to follow in the nimble footsteps of drag icons by taking on her dream role this fall. "
politics,"The “RuPaul’s Drag Race” veteran will star as Edna Turnblad in the national tour of the musical “Hairspray,” which opens Nov. 17 in San Diego, California, and will visit more than 60 U.S. cities. West will be joined by Niki Metcalf and Toneisha Harris as Tracy Turnblad and Motormouth Maybelle, respectively, with additional casting to be announced later. "
politics,"Based on John Waters’ 1988 film of the same name, “Hairspray” follows Tracy Turnblad, an energetic, fun-loving teen in 1960s Baltimore whose dream is to dance on the most popular variety show on TV. After landing a role, Tracy begins to campaign for the show to be desegregated so that she can share the spotlight with performers of color."
politics,"“This is the role I’ve always wanted,” said West, whose real name is Andrew Levitt. “Edna’s journey as a character is a journey I’ve been on ― not seeing how beautiful we are on the outside, not trusting we are worthy, being ashamed of ourselves. It’s a journey many of us go on, right?”"
politics,"Edna Turnblad, the protagonist’s mother, was played in the 1988 movie by drag icon Divine and in the original 2003 Broadway production of the musical by Harvey Fierstein. (The less said about John Travolta’s portrayal in the 2007 movie adaptation of the musical, the better.) "
politics,"West’s “Hairspray” journey dates back to 2019, when she received a phone call from Jerry Mitchell, who choreographed the original Broadway staging, to audition for the new production. She formally landed the role of Edna in March of last year, just one week before theaters across the U.S. closed to curb the spread of COVID-19. "
politics,"The experience of being cast in a dream role, only to have it ripped away indefinitely before rehearsals commenced, was “humbling,” West said. “As an artist, you’re like, ‘God, how do I prepare for this? What am I going to do next?’ Everyone was saying, ‘Pivot, pivot, pivot!’ So the pandemic, for me, has been a quick learning tool on how to regroup and how to constantly stay aware, awake and energized.” "
politics,"And to her credit, West has spent most of the past 16 months boosting her profile inmajor ways. Last year, she partnered with Dolly Parton for a clothing line called “Kindness is Queen” and, later, with actor Patricia Clarkson on a musical tribute to Kamala Harris, then the Democratic vice presidential nominee, before election night. In June, she hosted the livestreamed Disney+ concert “This Is Me: Pride Celebration Spectacular,” where she duetted with Kermit the Frog."
politics,The temporary restraining order Cardone granted will put Abbott’s decree on hold while the courts consider the case.
politics,"“The role allows me to bring Nina, a drag character I’ve been cultivating for 20 years,” she added. “It also allows me to be Andrew and celebrate that part of myself as an actor doing the work. I’ve really leaned into being very vulnerable with people and allowing myself to be pretty honest.” "
politics,"Collectively, West views those experiences her on-the-ground training for “Hairspray,” which she considers one of the best musicals ever written. "
politics,A federal judge temporarily blocked an executive order on Tuesday issued by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) that sought to restrict the ground transportation of migrants.
politics,U.S. District Judge Kathleen Cardone agreed with the federal government — which sued Abbott over the order last week — that the executive order would cause “irreparable injury” to the United States and to people the U.S. is “charged with protecting.”
politics,"Abbott had claimed the order was needed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. However, the Justice Department said in its lawsuit against Abbott that his order would only exacerbate the spread of the virus because a restriction on transportation would “result in immediate backups of unaccompanied children” at federal facilities, thereby increasing the risk of transmission."
politics,"Issued last Wednesday, Abbott’s order — which immigration rights advocates lambasted as “flagrantly illegal,” unconstitutional and xenophobic — prohibited nongovernment individuals and organizations from transporting migrants released from federal custody in Texas."
politics,"“The executive order will severely disrupt the Federal Government’s efforts to carry out its responsibilities under the federal immigration laws,” the Justice Department said in its court filing. "
politics,"Additionally, the Justice Department noted that contractors who are typically hired by the federal government to help transport sick migrants, conduct COVID-19 tests and provide safe spaces for quarantining would not be able to do their jobs under the order. "
politics,"Responding to Garland, Abbott said in a letter that his authority “to protect noncitizens directly conflicts with my authority, and duty, to protect citizens of Texas and the United States.”"
politics,Many critics thought there was something “Third Reich”-esque about them.
politics,U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said last week that Abbott’s order was both “dangerous and unlawful” and in violation of federal law “in numerous respects.”
politics,"Hamill, a longtime critic of the former president, agreed."
politics,“Star Wars” actor Mark Hamill joined in with the mockery of President Donald Trump’s proposed cards for supporters on Friday.
politics,"“We are at an impasse in our country,” she said. “People in our country are scared and unsure if it’s even safe to leave our homes. We’ve politicized getting a shot that will take care of people and allow them to be healthy. ... I think a show like ‘Hairspray’ is going to allow us to celebrate, reconnect and refocus.” "
politics,Trump’s Save America PAC this week sent out emails to the ex-president’s fans asking them to select their favorite of these four designs:
politics,The order also gave the Texas Department of Public Safety authority to stop and impound any private vehicle that officers have a “reasonable suspicion” is carrying migrants — a clause that activists said could encourage racial profiling.
politics,And he pointed out how to tell if merchandise from Trump was the real deal.
politics,"Mandates for the COVID-19 shots are popping up all over the country now, which means you may soon have to show proof of vaccination if you want to go to work, the gym or an indoor public event."
politics,"The requirements seem to be relatively popular. As many as two-thirds of Americans support them, if some recent polling is correct. But there are plenty of opponents out there. Among the loudest are some high-profile leaders in the Republican Party."
politics,"“It’s not an OFFICIAL Former Guy item unless it contains at least one misspelling and/or Third Reich imagery,” he tweeted."
politics,"“This is obviously OFFICAL,” Hamill added, referencing a typo on one of the cards."
politics,"Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) says vaccine requirements are products of the left’s “authoritarian instincts.” Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) describes the push for requirements as “vaccine fascism.” House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) responded to Biden’s announcement by tweeting, “No mandates for anyone,” and vowing that “Americans will stand for freedom” ― and then punctuating the line with an American flag emoji."
politics,"The requirements are a reaction to slowed vaccination rates that have left significant parts of the population without protection from the virus, just as the highly contagious delta variant is spreading. Among those supporting the new requirements is President Joe Biden, who has issued one for federal workers and encouraged both private and public employers to do the same."
politics,"“Florida is a free state, and we will empower our people,” DeSantis said in a fundraising letter this week. “We will not allow Joe Biden and his bureaucratic flunkies to come in and commandeer the rights and freedoms of Floridians.”"
politics,"Republicans at the state level are saying similar things and they are acting too, putting in place prohibitions on vaccine requirements in more than a dozen states. One of them is Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis has issued orders and signed legislation that bans vaccine requirements by private companies as well as local government agencies."
politics,"The virtual flag-waving, appeals to personal liberty, and warnings about “fascism” suggest there is something fundamentally un-American about vaccine mandates. But requirements to get inoculations have been around since the very first days of the republic, claiming broad support and withstanding legal challenges."
politics,What Liberals And Conservatives Say About Vaccine Mandates
politics,"This isn’t because officials or judges are ignoring freedom. It’s because they believe vaccination is a key to securing it. In fact, among those who support vaccine requirements today are some well-known conservative judges and libertarian scholars ― in other words, precisely the sort of people you would expect to protest government overreach most vociferously."
politics,"A basic justification for vaccine mandates is that your freedom doesn’t include the freedom to endanger the rest of your community. The principle is a bedrock of democratic philosophy and the American legal tradition, with courts applying it to a variety of contexts including public health."
politics,"“You can’t walk around assaulting people just because you feel like it’s an important part of your self-expression,” Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor, said in an interview. “And you can’t dump pollutants into a town’s drinking water just because you’d rather not pay for cleanup. By the same token, we require kids to get vaccinated for all sorts of illnesses before they go to public school. Otherwise, their bodies could be used as vectors to harm others.”"
politics,"The author of that ruling, Frank Easterbrook, is a well-respected conservative first put on the bench by President Ronald Reagan. In the opinion, Easterbrook argued that the Indiana University requirement was actually less onerous than the old Massachusetts requirement, because it applied only to people who are choosing to enroll at the university."
politics,"The most important legal precedent on vaccines specifically is a 1905 case called Jacobson v. Massachusetts, in which the Supreme Court upheld a state law requiring smallpox vaccination for adults. Just this week, a panel from a federal appeals court cited Jacobson when it upheld, unanimously, a new COVID-19 vaccine requirement for students at Indiana University."
politics,"“People who do not want to be vaccinated may go elsewhere,” Easterbrook wrote."
politics,"That appears to be true for all of the vaccine mandates now in place or under discussion: They are not requirements per se, but rather conditions for some kind of voluntary activity. Although the consequences can still be harsh ― say, if it means giving up a job ― many of the mandates, including the one Biden introduced for federal workers, offer alternatives like undergoing frequent testing plus a promise to observe social distancing."
politics,That’s in addition to exceptions for people who can cite legitimate religious grounds or who can’t get shots for medical reasons.
politics,"“In the eyes of the law, nothing under discussion is actually a mandate, in the sense of a government command backed up by coercion,” Bagley said."
politics,What Some Libertarians Say About Vaccine Mandates
politics,"Bagley is generally thought of as a liberal, but it’s not hard to find conservatives and libertarians who take the same view."
politics,"“In my view, people have the right to harm themselves by making bad choices,” Brennan said. “This is about protecting others from the undue risk of harm you impose upon them by being unvaccinated. The lower the personal costs/risks of the vaccine ― and the higher the risk that the unvaccinated impose upon others ― the stronger the case is for mandating vaccines.”"
politics,"In a 2013 paper titled “A Defense of Compulsory Vaccination,” Jessica Flanigan, a University of Richmond professor known for libertarian writings on bioethics, cited the example of people firing guns into the air in order to celebrate Independence Day. Governments can and do prohibit such behavior even though it’s a form of expression, Flanigan explained, because the bullet could end up hitting and even killing somebody."
politics,"“People are not entitled to harm innocents or to impose deadly risks on others,” Flanigan wrote."
politics,"Georgetown University professor Jason Brennan made a similar argument in a 2018 journal article called “A Libertarian Case for Mandatory Vaccination.” That was two years before COVID-19, but, he told HuffPost last week, he thinks the case for mandates now remains strong."
politics,"And then there is Ilya Somin, whom nobody would mistake for a fan of government power."
politics,"A professor at George Mason University and an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, he has spent much of his professional life decrying what he sees as state encroachments on personal liberty, whether it’s local authorities taking property under eminent domain or the federal government penalizing people for not getting health insurance."
politics,"“The issue here is not just that it saves lives, but that it potentially saves a great many of them, and not just those of the vaccinated people themselves,” Somin said. “It also protects others in the community. That makes it different from primarily paternalistic restrictions on liberty, such as, say, requiring motorcycle riders to wear helmets.”"
politics,"But Somin said in an interview that vaccine mandates make sense under certain circumstances and that the present situation qualifies. He described taking the shot as a “small burden” for the sake of much larger benefits, like slowing transmission and reducing the opportunities for new, more dangerous variants to emerge."
politics,"Somin said said he would feel differently about imposing a requirement on the public at large, rather than making the vaccines a condition for engaging in certain activities, in part because it would be a “law enforcement nightmare.” Somin also noted that many of the mandates are coming from private-sector companies acting on their own."
politics,"American laws and courts have long given private companies all kinds of leeway to dictate terms of employment, as well as whom they serve as customers. Libertarians like Somin are especially reluctant to see that erode, because they believe owners, workers and consumers end up better off when corporations operate with fewer restrictions."
politics,"One group that would be happy to cut down on management discretion over employees are labor unions, and that’s a big reason so many unions representing teachers, health care workers and other sectors subject to the mandates have been fighting them. "
politics,Where The Debate Goes From Here
politics,"The unions are also representing workers who, in many cases, are genuinely fearful of the vaccines. This is especially true for the health care unions whose memberships include large numbers of Black Americans, whose vaccination numbers nationwide have lagged in part because of deep distrust of the medical establishment that has built up over the centuries."
politics,"Still, many of the unions fighting the requirements are focusing more on the specifics of verification and exceptions to the rules. That’s different from the categorical rejection of mandates you hear from Cruz, DeSantis and the other Republicans. And although the unions certainly represent a lot of members, those GOP officials have a lot of influence ― especially when it comes to the part of the population most hostile to getting vaccinated."
politics,"Of course, from a public health perspective, that’s all the more reason to impose the mandate: to boost vaccination among people who take the pandemic seriously and are part of communities that have suffered disproportionately from COVID-19. And that’s not to mention the biggest reason, which is that unvaccinated health care workers are a direct threat to the safety and well-being of patients."
politics,"A Justice Department official appointed by Donald Trump attempted to block results from the 2020 election by pushing a wild theory that votes may have been hacked by Chinese intelligence agents armed with digital thermometers, according to emails obtained by the House Oversight Committee."
politics,"Jeffrey Clark, who was the head of the DOJ’s civil division at the time, told senior department officials that he had information indicating the Chinese government could use digital thermometers to change results in Dominion machines that were tallying votes, sources told CNN."
politics,"“Hackers have evidence ... that a Dominion machine accessed the Internet through a smart thermostat with a net connection trail leading back to China,” Clark wrote in an email."
politics,"The push to hold up the election was part of Trump’s campaign to not leave the White House, even though Joe Biden had been elected president. Trump told then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen in December to “just say the election was corrupt, and leave the rest to me,” according to notes taken of his phone call, which were also obtained by the Oversight Committee."
politics,"The imagined connection between China and the U.S. presidential election is a key element of QAnon conspiracy theories. The vote audit in Arizona’s Maricopa County — led by Cyber Ninjas CEO and QAnon believer Doug Logan — has also examined ballots for evidence of “bamboo fibers,” which some have baselessly claimed could prove interference by the Chinese government."
politics,"Clark also wrote a draft letter, published by ABC News, in which he urged Georgia officials to call a special session of the state legislature to challenge the vote there. He falsely claimed in the letter that DOJ had identified “significant concerns that may have impacted of the outcome of the election in multiple States, including the State of Georgia.”"
politics,"Rosen refused to take any action to block results — including signing off on the Georgia letter — despite pressure from Trump and Clark, noting that there was no evidence of any election fraud. "
politics,"Clark insisted on pushing his claim of Chinese interference even after an intelligence briefing for the Justice Department stating that there was “no evidence that foreign interference had affected vote tallies,” CNN reported. "
politics,Trump was reportedly considering firing Rosen at the time and replacing him with Clark so he could remain in the White House.
politics,"Rosen had a two-hour meeting on Friday with the Office of the Inspector General of the Justice Department, and provided closed-door testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Saturday about Clark’s attempts to “subvert” the presidential election, The New York Times reported."
politics,"He spoke about five different encounters with Clark, according to the Times. "
politics,"Rosen described exchanges with Clark in which he continued to press colleagues to make statements about the election “that they found to be untrue,” a person familiar with the interviews told the Times. He reportedly also revealed that he learned Clark had had unauthorized conversations with Trump about using the Justice Department to publicly “cast doubt” on Biden’s win."
politics,Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn) called Rosen’s accounts “dramatic evidence of how intent Trump was in overthrowing the election.”
politics,"Clark, who left the DOJ in January, could not be reached for comment. "
politics,"But he told Bloomberg in January that he had engaged in a “candid discussion of options and pros and cons with the president,” apparently concerning the election. He said he couldn’t reveal “specifics” because they were confidential."
politics,"“This moratorium is the right thing to do to keep people in their homes and out of congregate settings where COVID-19 spreads,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said in a statement."
politics,The Biden administration issued a new eviction moratorium on Tuesday after progressive lawmakers turned up the pressure as protections for millions of vulnerable renters lapsed over the weekend.
politics,"The national moratorium on evictions, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first put in place in September 2020, expired on July 31 without further extension."
politics,The CDC’s new moratorium targets counties with elevated rates of COVID-19 infections and will last for 60 days.
politics,"“It is imperative that public health authorities act quickly to mitigate such an increase of evictions, which could increase the likelihood of new spikes in SARS-CoV-2 transmission,” Walensky continued. “Such mass evictions and the attendant public health consequences would be very difficult to reverse.”"
politics,"Until now, the White House has been adamant that it did not have the “legal authority” to extend a national ban on evictions — not even a more targeted one — citing a month-old Supreme Court ruling."
politics,"Roughly 3.6 million adults in the United States reported they were within two months of eviction as of June, including 2 million households with kids, according to recent census data. Those individuals and families were left to rely on individual state and city policies as of Sunday. Only a handful of states have their own eviction moratoriums in place."
politics,"“On this particular issue, the president has not only kicked the tires, but double, triple and quadruple checked,” White House adviser Gene Sperling told reporters just Monday."
politics,"Notably, the Supreme Court ruling from June did not ban the White House from extending the moratorium. But in his concurring opinion allowing for the moratorium to stay in place through July, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that he believed any further extension would need congressional approval. "
politics,"President Joe Biden, acknowledging the coming announcement from the CDC after a speech on vaccination rates on Tuesday, still raised concerns about whether this new moratorium will pass legal muster."
politics,"“At a minimum, by the time it is litigated, it will probably give some additional time while we are getting that $45 billion out to people who are in fact behind on their rent and don’t have the money,” Biden said."
politics,"Congress has passed $46 billion in rental assistance over two COVID-19 relief bills in the last eight months. States and cities have been extremely slow in getting that money out, however. As of June, only $3 billion of those funds had been distributed, according to numbers from the Treasury Department."
politics,"As the end of the moratorium approached late last week, the White House called on Congress to extend the moratorium — a move that surprised Democratic leadership. House Democrats couldn’t muster enough votes even among their own ranks to extend the measure. Then, on Friday evening, the House attempted to extend the moratorium unanimously but Republican lawmakers blocked the effort. The bill never even made it to the Senate and most House members went back to their home districts for August recess. "
politics,"On Monday, the Biden administration called on states to reimpose eviction moratoriums for at least two more months as the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus spreads rapidly across the country. The administration also urged landlords to hold off on evictions for at least 30 days."
politics,"Meanwhile, a group of the House’s most progressive lawmakers, led by Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), has been staging a protest against the end of the moratorium by sleeping on the Capitol steps. On Monday night, the group was joined by Rev. William Barber of the Poor People’s Campaign, who was in the area protesting for civil rights and higher wages."
politics,"“I applaud the CDC for imposing an eviction moratorium for the vast majority of the population,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""I particularly applaud Rep. Cori Bush who understands what it’s like to be evicted and who took her passion and turned it into amazingly effective action. And I am proud of my Democratic colleagues in the House and Senate for keeping a spotlight on this issue and giving a voice to the millions of Americans who, through no fault of their own, are at risk of being evicted from their home."""
politics,Bush claimed victory Tuesday evening.
politics,Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer praised Bush and fellow progressive lawmakers like New York Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Mondaire Jones for their activism Tuesday night.

politics,"On Monday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi reiterated it was up to the Biden administration to extend the moratorium, signaling that the political dynamics in Congress were too difficult to get anything done. Any eviction moratorium passed through Congress would have needed at least 10 Republican supporters."

politics,"It’s when Pasifika people were targeted for deportation in the mid-1970s during aggressive home raids by authorities to find, convict and deport visa overstayers. The raids often took place very early in the morning or late at night."
politics,"At the time of the raids, many Pacific people had come to New Zealand on temporary visas to help fill a need for workers in the nation’s factories and fields. But the government appeared to turn on the community by deciding those workers were no longer needed."
politics,"By being covered in the mat, Ardern was taking part in a traditional Samoan ritual known as an ifoga, in which the subject seeks forgiveness by exposing themselves to a kind of public humiliation."
politics,Ardern told a tearful crowd of several hundred that the government was offering a formal and unreserved apology.
politics,It was part of an emotional ceremony at the Auckland Town Hall during which Ardern formally apologized for a racially charged part of the nation’s history known as the Dawn Raids.
politics,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern sat motionless Sunday as members of the Pacific Island community pulled a large white mat over her head, completely covering her. Moments later they removed it and embraced her."
politics,"“The government expresses its sorrow, remorse, and regret that the Dawn Raids and random police checks occurred and that these actions were ever considered appropriate,” Ardern said."
politics,"People who didn’t look like white New Zealanders were told they should carry identification to prove they weren’t overstayers, and were often randomly stopped in the street, or even at schools or churches. Even though many overstayers at the time were British or American, only Pacific people were targeted for deportation."
politics,"Ardern said that while the raids took place almost 50 years ago, their legacy continued."
politics,"“As part of this, the community will have the opportunity to come forward and share their experiences,” Ardern said."
politics,"Ardern said that as a gesture of goodwill, the government would fund new education and training scholarships for Pacific communities and would help compile an official account of the raids from written records and oral history."
politics,"“It remains vividly etched in the memory of those who were directly impacted. It lives on in the disruption of trust and faith in authorities. And it lives on in the unresolved grievances of Pacific communities that these events happened and that to this day they have gone unaddressed,” she said."
politics,Tongan Princess Mele Siu’ilikutapu Kalaniuvalu Fotofili said the impact of the Dawn Raids had haunted her community for generations.
politics,"The princess said that while some members of her Tongan community might have been on the wrong side of the law at the time, it didn’t warrant the extreme measures taken against them."
politics,"“We are grateful to your government for making the right decision to apologize,” she said to Ardern. “To right the extreme, inhumane, racist and unjust treatment, specifically against my community, in the Dawn Raids era.”"
politics,"But the princess said the government could do a better job of responding to current immigration needs, a comment which drew sustained applause. She said petitions had been submitted to find pathways and residency for overstayers and visa-holders."
politics,"“This is a new dawn for my community and the Pacific community at large,” she said."
politics,"Sunday’s ceremony had originally been scheduled for June but was delayed due to coronavirus measures. The apology didn’t come with any broader financial compensation or legal changes, but many Pacific people say it represented an important first step."
politics,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas Democrats still refused to return to the state Capitol on Saturday as Gov. Greg Abbott began a third attempt at passing new election laws, prolonging a monthslong standoff that ramped up in July when dozens of Democratic state lawmakers left the state and hunkered down in Washington, D.C."
politics,"“A quorum is not present,” said Republican House Speaker Dade Phelan, who then adjourned the chamber until Monday."
politics,"More than 50 Democrats last month bolted to the nation’s capital, but the precise whereabouts of each of them is unclear. In a joint statement Saturday, Democrats said 26 of them would remain “part of an active presence in Washington maintained for as long as Congress is working.”"
politics,"But there were also signs the stalemate may be thawing. Two of the Democrats who decamped last month returned to Austin Saturday, and one of them said enough of his colleagues may also begin trickling back to secure a quorum next week. And, notably, Republicans did not invoke a procedural move that would give Phelan the authority to sign arrest warrants for missing lawmakers, as they did when the Democrats left town."
politics,"“People are talking to their friends, and we think we’re going to see quite a few more,” he said."
politics,"“I was encouraged that the baton would be carried by my Washington colleagues at the federal level, that there would be sweeping reform nationwide,” Lucio III said."
politics,Democratic state Rep. Eddie Lucio III said those who might return were feeling the pull of personal and professional demands.
politics,"It was not just Democrats who were absent Saturday: Six Republicans were also out, including one who recently tested positive for COVID-19."
politics,"Republican state. Rep. Jim Murphy, chairman of the House Republican Caucus, also believed that more Democrats would come back in the coming days."
politics,"Heading into the weekend, Democratic leaders had not committed to sitting out the entire 30-day session, leaving open the possibility that enough could return at some point to end the standoff. Republicans want to advance an overhaul of elections in Texas under legislation that largely remains the same despite the months of walkouts and protests by Democratic lawmakers."
politics,"Texas would ban 24-hour polling locations, drive-thru voting and give partisan poll watchers more access under the bill that Republicans were on the brink of passing in May. But that effort was foiled by Democrats abruptly leaving the Capitol in a late-night walkout."
politics,"Democrats made a bigger gambit — by decamping to Washington on chartered jets — to run out the clock on the GOP’s second try. Democrats had hoped to exert pressure on President Joe Biden and Congress to pass federal voting rights legislation, but a Senate Republican filibuster continues to block such a measure."
politics,"Democrat Jasmine Crockett, one of the state representatives remaining in Washington, said she would be disappointed if enough of her colleagues returned to give Republicans a quorum next week. She said their group is not “naive” and knows they don’t have the votes to permanently hold off passage of a bill in Texas, but are still hoping for movement in Congress."
politics,Biden never met with the Texas Democrats in Washington. The group was quickly forced to change some plans after several of their members tested positive for COVID-19. Reports that two Democrats snuck away to Europe also led to bad headlines and invited mockery from Republicans back home.
politics,"There has been a recent sharp surge in COVID-19 infections in Texas, where the number of people hospitalized with the virus stands at more than 8,500 patients, the highest number since February. But Abbott is adamant that Texas will not bring back pandemic restrictions or mask mandates and has prohibited schools from requiring face coverings. Many of the state’s 5 million students are scheduled to return to classrooms this month."
politics,"“I’m not giving up on anything. I’m not going home until the fat lady sings,” Crockett said."
politics,Rapinoe appeared more disappointed in Trump than angry at him. 
politics,Star forward Megan Rapinoe of the U.S. Women’s Soccer Team on Friday hit back at former President Donald Trump for his vicious attack on the American athletes for being “woke” and winning a bronze medal at the Olympics instead of gold.
politics,"“It’s a real sad dig into an old bag,” the athlete told Nexstar Media Wire reporter Jack Doles of Trump’s attack on Thursday. “I’m just like, ‘You’re rooting for people to do bad?’ Yikes.”"
politics,"Trump called the American players both “woke” and “bad,” and said they should be replaced by “patriots.”"
politics,"The “bad” comment was evidently a reference to Trump’s criticism that the women on the team are “woke” — politically enlightened — and that he therefore expected, and apparently hoped, they would perform poorly."
politics,"“Woke means you lose, everything that is woke goes bad, and our soccer team certainly has,” Trump said in a statement that was posted by paid aide Liz Harrington on Twitter, which is failing to enforce its lifetime “ban” on the former president. "
politics,"“If our soccer team, headed by a radical group of Leftist Maniacs, wasn’t woke, they would have won the Gold Medal instead of the Bronze,” he claimed. "
politics,"An Olimpico goal is usually considered a once-in-a-lifetime feat. But it was the second time that Rapinoe wowed fans with the stunner — and at an Olympics, no less. She made the same spectacular corner kick goal in 2012, in London, when the team won gold."
politics,"Trump singled out Rapinoe, whom he called “the woman with the purple hair [who] played terribly and spends too much time thinking about Radical Left politics and not doing her job!”"
politics,"“We didn’t have the tournament we wanted to,” Rapinoe admitted to Doles. But “the performance we had in the last game, that’s who we want to be and that’s who we are,” she added matter-of-factly."
politics,"Trump apparently doesn’t have a clue about how soccer is played. In the U.S. team’s face-off with Australia Thursday, Rapinoe delivered a stunning, corner-kick “Olimpico” goal deep into the net. The United States won that game 4-3, netting a bronze medal in the process. Rapinoe scored two of the team’s four goals."
politics,"The relationship between Trump and the team has long been strained, particularly when it comes to Rapinoe, who last year blasted Trump as a “white nationalist.” Asked in 2019 about the possibility that the White House might invite the team for a visit, prior to their FIFA Women’s World Cup victory that year, Rapinoe let it be known: “I’m not going to the fucking White House.”"
politics,"As cases of COVID-19 soar in Texas, all parents won’t be informed if there’s an outbreak of coronavirus in their children’s public schools."
politics,"Even if America’s former leader wasn’t impressed (or else wasn’t knowledgeable enough to understand what happened), Rapinoe and millions of fans were proud of the U.S. team."
politics,The TEA also warns: “School systems cannot require students or staff to wear a mask.” 
politics,"In addition, schools will no longer be required to carry out contact tracing of a COVID-19 outbreak to determine the source of the virus and how it’s spreading in the school community. Tracing was dropped because data from last school year revealed “very low COVID-19 transmission rates in a classroom setting and data demonstrating lower transmission rates among children than adults,” the TEA noted."
politics,"Notifications will only be required if a district learns a child was a “close contact” of someone with the virus. Those parents can then “opt” to keep their child at home, according to new guidelines issued earlier this week by the Texas Education Agency. "
politics,"But health experts warn that the dangerously more contagious delta variant of COVID-19, which is currently the dominant strain in Texas, is having a far greater impact on children."
politics,"“We’re dealing with a variant that is more contagious, that is potentially more dangerous to children based on the number of children getting admitted to the hospital,” Dr. Seth D. Kaplan, president of the Texas Pediatric Society, told the Texas Tribune. "
politics,"Vaccinated people are not considered a close contact who should be informed, according to the guidelines, even though vaccinated individuals can catch and spread the disease. "
politics,"Texas State Teachers Association President Ovidia Molina blasted the new guidelines as “woefully” inadequate to “help districts keep campuses, students and employees safe.”"
politics,"“Our concern right now is that we’re being given guidelines based on old conditions, but we’re not adjusting for what the current conditions are,” he warned. “We no longer have universal masking, and we have a much more contagious variant of virus.”"
politics,"The delta variant isn’t only a threat to children, but to their parents, who can end up fighting for their lives in an intensive care unit after contracting COVID-19 from their children, said Kaplan. “Numbers have started to explode” from COVID-19 outbreaks at summer camps, he added."
politics,"School districts still must report positive COVID-19 cases to their local health departments and the state, but it’s unclear if those reports will be linked to the schools in public records that parents can access."

politics,The outfit drew instant comparisons to what conservatives faux-slammed then-President Barack Obama for wearing to a press conference in August 2014.
politics,"With Biden, though, the critical response was more muted."
politics,Veteran broadcast journalist Dan Rather suggested it was some sort of trolling of Fox News:
politics,"“Today, for some reason ... we’re not hearing the same kind of ridiculous faux outrage on the right,” said Melber. “Maybe they’re embarrassed because it didn’t work last time.”"
politics,"Others also theorized, including one involving Obama’s 60th birthday this week:"
politics,"TOKYO (AP) — A Belarusian Olympic sprinter plans to seek asylum in Poland, an activist group said Monday, after the athlete alleged that her team’s officials tried to force her to fly home, where she feared she wouldn’t be safe from an autocratic government that recently was accused of diverting a plane in order to arrest a dissident journalist."
politics,"Tsimanouskaya was then apparently hustled to the airport but refused to board a flight for Istanbul and instead approached police for help. In a filmed message distributed on social media, she also asked the International Olympic Committee for assistance."
politics,"Athlete Krystsina Tsimanouskaya is applying for a visa at the Polish embassy in Tokyo, according to Vadim Krivosheyev, of the Belarusian Sport Solidarity Foundation. He told The Associated Press that the group has bought her a plane ticket to Warsaw for Aug. 4."
politics,"The current standoff apparently began after Tsimanouskaya criticized how officials were managing her team — setting off a massive backlash in state-run media back home, where authorities relentlessly crack down on government critics. Tsimanouskaya said on her Instagram account that she was put in the 4x400 relay even though she has never raced in the event."
politics,"“I was put under pressure, and they are trying to forcibly take me out of the country without my consent,” the 24-year-old runner said in the message."
politics,"Belarus’ authoritarian government has relentlessly targeted anyone even mildly expressing dissent since a presidential election a year ago triggered a wave of unprecedented mass protests. And it has also gone to extremes to stop its critics, including the recent plane diversion that European officials called an act of air piracy."
politics,"“The campaign was quite serious and that was a clear signal that her life would be in danger in Belarus,” Alexander Opeikin, a spokesman for the BSSF, told the AP in an interview."
politics,"Athletes seeking asylum at global sporting events is nothing new. It was especially frequent during the Cold War but has also happened occasionally in the decades since. As many as 117 athletes defected at the Munich Olympics in 1972, for instance, according to reports at the time. At least four Romanians and a Soviet associated with the Olympics defected at the Montreal Games in 1976. And Cuban athletes have frequently done so."
politics,"The rapid-fire series of events brought international political intrigue to Olympic Games that have been more focused on operational dramas, like maintaining safety during a pandemic and navigating widespread Japanese opposition to holding the event at all."
politics,"In this context, Tsimanouskaya feared for her safety once she saw the campaign against her in state media, according to the sports foundation, which she also contacted for help."
politics,"Underscoring the seriousness of the allegations, several groups and countries say they are helping the runner. Poland and the Czech Republic offered assistance, and Japan’s Foreign Ministry said it was working with the International Olympic Committee and the Tokyo Olympics organizers."
politics,"Outside the Polish embassy Monday, two exiled Belarusian women who live in Tokyo offered the runner support. They waved a flag that was a mix of the opposition’s banner and the Japanese flag."
politics,"“The IOC … is looking into the situation and has asked the NOC for clarification,” it said in a statement."
politics,Many critics of Belarus’ government have fled to Poland. Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przydacz said on Twitter that Tsimanouskaya has been offered a “humanitarian visa and is free to pursue her sporting career in Poland if she so chooses.”
politics,Czech Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhanek also tweeted that the Czech Republic has offered her asylum.
politics,"“If she decides to accept it, we’ll do our maximum to help her,” he wrote."
politics,"The Belarus National Olympic Committee has been led for more than 25 years by authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko and his son, Viktor."
politics,A spokeswoman for the Belarus Olympic team did not respond to a request for comment.
politics,"Both Lukashenkos are banned from the Tokyo Olympics by the IOC, which investigated complaints from athletes that they faced reprisals and intimidation during the crackdown following the wave of anti-government protests over the last year."
politics,"In May, Belarussian authorities diverted a passenger plane to Minsk — and pulled journalist and activist Raman Pratasevich and his Russian girlfriend off the flight."
politics,"Pratasevich, who ran a channel on a messaging app used to organize demonstrations against Lukashenko’s rule, left his homeland in 2019. He has been charged with fomenting mass unrest and is under house arrest while he awaits trial."
politics,"The elder Lukashenko maintained that there was a bomb threat against the plane and that’s why a fighter jet was scrambled to force it to land, but the move was roundly criticized by Western leaders."
politics,Associated Press journalists Daria Litvinova and Daniel Kozin contributed to this report from Moscow.
politics,"Amid Monday’s drama, Tsimanouskaya missed the Olympic 200-meter heats that she was due to participate in. She already competed for Belarus on the first day of track events Friday at the National Stadium in Tokyo. She placed fourth in her first-round heat in the 100 meters, timing 11.47 seconds, and did not advance."

politics,"H. Scott Apley, 45, a member of the State Republican Executive Committee and Dickinson City Council, died Wednesday, the Galveston County Republican Party announced in a Facebook post with an “extremely heavy heart.” "
politics,"The post didn’t mention the cause of death. But Apley was admitted to a local hospital last Sunday with “pneumonia-like symptoms and tested positive for COVID,” and was placed on a ventilator, according to a GoFundMe page set up for his family."
politics,"“A tragedy,” the GOP Facebook post read. ” Please pray for Melissa and Reid and their family. God remains in control, although this is yet another tough one to swallow.”"
politics,"Apley’s widow, Melissa, also tested positive for the coronavirus but has not been hospitalized, according to the GoFundMe page. They recently had a baby son, Reid."
politics,"“Better get the jab,” one person responded."
politics,Another responded after Apley’s death: “Rest in peace. Wish you would have got vaccinated so your family doesn’t have to mourn you.”
politics,The Republican leader also posted a message claiming that Germany “plans to force people who won’t quarantine into camps.”
politics,"In April, Apley slammed news on Twitter about the effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine."
politics,"A week ago Apley had reposted a mocking commentary about the changing COVID-19 vaccination situation, noting that in six months the nation had gone from “the vax ending the pandemic to ... you can still die of COVID if you get vaxxed ... to the unvaxxed are killing the vaxxed.”"
politics,"In one particularly heartbreaking post in early July, Apley wrote: “Nothing makes you contemplate your mortality like attending the funeral of a friend. I hope to live a long time. I have a lot of things that I want to do, and see, and experience with my wife and my friends, and my family. And I have a lot of hopes and dreams for my son Reid.”"

politics,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki slammed Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) for his dangerous stance against face masks amid skyrocketing COVID-19 cases in his state, and accused the governor of cynically using the divisive issue for “fundraising.”"
politics,"Psaki replied: “I will say, as a parent myself — I have two young children — that I want public health officials to make decisions about how to keep my kids safe, not politicians. And not only is Governor DeSantis not abiding by public health decisions, he’s fundraising off of this.”"
politics,"Psaki was responding to a question Friday from Peter Doocy of Fox News, who mentioned DeSantis’ threat to stop funding to Florida schools that require masks to help stem the spread of the coronavirus. Doocy asked if President Joe Biden shouldn’t also consider leaving the mask issue up to students’ parents."
politics,"She said parents in Florida and the rest of the nation should be able to know that their children are going to school in safe environments. “That shouldn’t be too much to ask,” Psaki said."
politics,"DeSantis’ campaign team has sought to capitalize on the conspiratorial hostility that some voters harbor for scientists and public health officials, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert. DeSantis’ team is selling T-shirts and beverage coolers that read “Don’t Fauci My Florida.”"
politics,"Florida is now the epicenter of the U.S. in terms of COVID-19 spread, accounting for at least 20% of the nation’s cases the past few weeks."
politics,"The state reported 134,506 new COVID-19 cases over the last week on Friday, more than any other seven-day period during the pandemic, according to CNN. Florida reported an average of 19,215 cases each day during that time, according to data released Friday by the state Health Department. The week’s total was about 22% higher than the previous week."
politics,"The previous record high was set Jan. 8, with 125,937 cases reported over seven days, for an average of 17,991 cases each day, according to data from Johns Hopkins University, CNN noted."
politics,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meanwhile, have recommended masking at schools as the highly contagious delta coronavirus variant continues to spread."
politics,"Yet DeSantis is ignoring the skyrocketing number of cases, insisting it’s a matter of parents’ freedom of choice to allow their children to go unmasked."
politics,"“We can either have a free society or we can have a biomedical security state, and I can tell you, Florida, we’re a free state,” DeSantis said at a Wednesday news conference."
politics,"He also said that he won’t let his own young children wear masks, because he wants to see them “smiling.”"

politics,"TOKYO (AP) — Sometimes, her workouts on an exercise machine were cut short when Zoe started crying."
politics,"Baby steps, she told herself."
politics,"She was cleared to have a cheerleader, too — nearly 7-month-old Zoe Cherotich Gannon (she has a visa). This after helping push organizers to allow breastfeeding mothers to be allowed to take their babies to the Olympics."
politics,"Baby steps, indeed."
politics,By taking it slow and steady — advice from other long-distance running moms — Tuliamuk worked her way back after giving birth in January. All the way back to where she will be Saturday — the starting line for the women’s marathon in Sapporo for the Tokyo Games.
politics,"“It worked out,” Tuliamuk said, “perfectly.”"
politics,"The original plan was to start a family after the Tokyo Olympics in 2020. But when the Summer Games were postponed by the pandemic, the 32-year-old Tuliamuk and her fiancé, Tim Gannon, decided not to wait. She had a spot on the team thanks to her win at the U.S. marathon trials on Feb. 29, 2020, just days before the coronavirus shut things down."
politics,She knows now just how fortunate she was to make it back in such a short time. Everything went according to plan with the pregnancy and the delivery on Jan. 13. The recovery as well. The only adjustment? Workouts are on Zoe time.
politics,"“I look back now and I realize how naive I was,” Tuliamuk said. “I was very naive to think I would just get pregnant right away, I’d be able to run through my pregnancy, then I’d be able to come back really fast. Those are things that I didn’t know, but I also got very lucky.”"
politics,"Following her daughter’s birth, she didn’t start running until around eight weeks later. From there, she eased back into it. That was on the advice of her doctor, her physical therapist and by drawing inspiration from runners/moms such as Kara Goucher and Alysia Montano."
politics,Anything to start Tuliamuk on the path back.
politics,"Tuliamuk got creative with her workouts, putting Zoe next to her as she got in a few minutes on an elliptical machine before stopping to feed her."
politics,"“When she goes to sleep, I’d put her back to bed and go back and finish a workout — even if I’m really tired and don’t feel like training anymore,” said Tuliamuk, who divides her time between Santa Fe, New Mexico, and Flagstaff, Arizona. “I’m like, ‘I have to do this.’ At night, sleep’s not guaranteed. I have to wake up and go run, feeling like a zombie.”"
politics,"Her first race back was July 4 in Atlanta. A 10K that produced a time of 32 minutes, 41 seconds and a sixth-place finish."
politics,It just affirmed something she knew — she was on the right path. Because that time was actually faster — by about eight seconds — than her winning time in 2017.
politics,"“So far, so good,” said Tuliamuk, one of 32 siblings, all of whom shared a father. “It’s harder than usual but I’m not injured, so that’s a good thing. It’s just having the sense that I’m coming back from being out of shape. But I’m really loving it. I’m loving the pain.”"
politics,Tuliamuk did her last big buildup session a few weeks ago — 15 miles at 5:41 pace.
politics,"“I don’t know what this means for my race but I am very optimistic,” she said in a post on social media."
politics,"This certainly lifted her spirits: Zoe recently received her visa to travel to Japan, where the Olympic marathons will be held in Sapporo because of heat concerns in Tokyo."
politics,"In late June, the International Olympic Committee announced that nursing mothers were allowed to bring their babies to Tokyo."
politics,"“What a relief it feels not to have to imagine my breastfeeding daughter being miles away from me,” she posted. “Thank you to IOC and the host country of Japan for making sure that nursing moms didn’t have to choose between their babies and their careers.”"
politics,"On one occasion, she met Kenyan marathoner Tegla Loroupe, who happened to be giving a talk at Tuliamuk’s school and was told of her talent. She gave Tuliamuk a pair of racing shoes."
politics,"Only, Tuliamuk didn’t wear them all that often — they looked too nice."

politics,"President Joe Biden’s administration is extending the moratorium on federal student loan payments until Jan. 31, 2022, the Education Department announced Friday."
politics,"The moratorium, which covers the overwhelming majority of student loans in the United States, began under President Donald Trump shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic began. Upon taking office earlier this year, Biden extended it until the end of September."
politics,The administration is emphasizing that this will be the final extension of the payment pause. The Education Department — which oversees $1.4 trillion worth of student loan debt held by more than 40 million borrowers — said in a statement that setting a definitive end date for the moratorium will give both borrowers and loan servicers time to prepare for payments to restart. 
politics,"“As our nation’s economy continues to recover from a deep hole, this final extension will give students and borrowers the time they need to plan for restart and ensure a smooth pathway back to repayment,” Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said."
politics,"Congressional Democrats, led by Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.), Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), had pressured Biden to extend the moratorium. Many lawmakers clamoring for the administration to extend the moratorium were progressives, but some moderates — including Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) — also backed an extension."
politics,"Pressley, Schumer and Warren applauded Biden’s decision in a statement, but also pushed for the administration to go further. They said they looked “forward to hearing the administration’s next steps to address the student debt crisis.”"
politics,"“While this temporary relief is welcome, it doesn’t go far enough,” the trio said. “Our broken student loan system continues to exacerbate racial wealth gaps and hold back our entire economy.”"
politics,"The Biden administration has so far resisted calls for a wide cancellation of student debt, and has said it is studying the president’s legal and policy options. The legal basis for extending the moratorium is the same as the legal basis for cancellation."
politics,Some members of the administration were worried that extending the moratorium would undercut the administration’s messaging on the economy — White House official spent much of Friday touting a strong jobs report — but student loan servicers may have needed additional time to prepare for the loans to restart without causing chaos for borrowers.
politics,"Three senators — Warren, as well as Sens. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) and Tina Smith (D-Minn.) — released a survey last month showing that most major student loan servicers had done little outreach to prepare for payments to restart and were waiting for additional guidance from Federal Student Aid, the agency that oversees the government’s student loan portfolio. "
politics,"An additional potential complication for the extension: Two major student loan servicers, Granite State Management and Resources and FedLoan, are set to let their contracts with the federal government to manage the loans end in December. Some advocates worry the government could struggle to transition millions of loans to a new servicer in time for payments to restart at the end of January. "
politics,A New Jersey gym owner and Donald Trump supporter who harassed and assaulted officers during the Jan. 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol pleaded guilty to two counts on Friday ― becoming the first Capitol attack defendant to enter a guilty plea in connection with an assault on law enforcement.
politics,"Scott Fairlamb, whose father was a New Jersey trooper and whose brother was on Michelle Obama’s Secret Service detail, pleaded guilty to two counts: one of obstruction of an official proceeding, and one of assaulting an officer."
politics,"Both counts are felonies, and the plea agreement states that the sentencing guidelines call for between 41 months minimum and 51 months maximum imprisonment. Fairlamb’s lawyer can argue for less prison time at sentencing."
politics,"Fairlamb’s attorney, Harley Breite, told HuffPost earlier this week that his client wanted to “assume responsibility for the things that he did” and “make amends for them and move on with his life.” Fairlamb has been incarcerated since his arrest in January."
politics,"In video footage and social media posts presented by the government, Fairlamb can be seen harassing and assaulting officers during the attack on the Capitol. He screamed about disarming police, and got in an officer’s face and asked him if he was an American."
politics,"“I feel for his wife, family, employees and community, but I have zero empathy for him,” the acquaintance said. “He’s had too many chances over the years to correct his pattern of bullying behavior ― all while portraying himself as a ‘good guy with a Batman cape’ in his hometown.”"
politics,"An associate of Fairlamb told HuffPost after his arrest in January that over the past eight to 10 years, the former MMA fighter and gym owner “got pulled more and more into the conspiracy theory vortex and pushed everything in his life aside for it.”"
politics,The FBI has made more than 550 arrests in connection with the Jan. 6 attack. Hundreds more arrests are in the works as part of the most sprawling FBI investigation in American history.
politics,"“Trump’s first campaign set his targets on [Hillary Clinton] and ‘lock her up,’ then it moved to QAnon type stuff over the last few years and ultimately resulted in his participation in the Jan. 6 Capitol riot,” the acquaintance told HuffPost."
politics,This is a developing story. Check back for updates.
politics,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) will not be resigning any time soon, despite a damning report that recounts 11 allegations of sexual harassment against him."
politics,"At a Friday press conference, Cuomo’s personal attorney and the attorney who represents the office of the governor made it clear that Cuomo will not go down without a fight. In what felt like a desperate attempt to cause confusion, the attorneys tried to cast doubt on multiple accusers’ timelines of events and claimed to have found granular inconsistencies in their stories. "
politics,"During the event, which lasted over an hour, Cuomo’s personal attorney, Rita Glavin, also pointed to instances in which she alleged New York state Attorney General Letitia James’ report was factually incorrect and biased."
politics,"“I know the difference between putting a case together against a target versus doing independent fact-finding with an open mind, and there has been no open-minded fact-finding in this case,” said Glavin, who later accused investigators of intentionally ignoring evidence that would prove Cuomo’s innocence. “This was not an exercise in truth telling.”"
politics,"As Cuomo digs in his heels, impeachment or criminal proceedings become ever more likely. Over half of the New York state legislature supports impeachment and one of Cuomo’s accusers filed a criminal complaint on Friday."
politics,They claimed that they were not given any heads up about the report’s findings or when the report would be published. They argued that this intentionally barred Cuomo and other senior staff from responding to the findings in the investigation before the media covered the story. 
politics,"Glavin and Paul Fisherman, the attorney representing the office of the governor, alleged that Cuomo and his senior staff were not given the opportunity to review their own transcripts from interviews with investigators, though presumably an impeachment trial — or criminal proceedings — will afford them that opportunity."
politics,There is no way to corroborate Glavin’s claims that the attorney general’s report was biased or factually incorrect. The state attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. 
politics,James released a 165-page report on Tuesday that found that Cuomo sexually harassed at least 11 women. James said the governor “sexually harassed current and former New York State employees by engaging in unwelcome and non-consensual touching and making numerous offensive comments of a suggestive and sexual nature that created a hostile work environment for women.” 
politics,"The evidence from the investigation painted a “deeply disturbing yet clear picture” that Cuomo sexually harassed female employees and created a hostile work environment for women, James said. The report also concluded that Cuomo and his senior staffers retaliated against one woman who accused him of sexual harassment. "
politics,"The investigation began in March after nine women publicly accused Cuomo of sexual harassment that included. inappropriate comments, groping and non-consensual kissing. The attorney general’s report included two new allegations, one from a state trooper who was assigned to the governor’s protective detail. "
politics,"Although Cuomo’s behavior violated state and federal law, the attorney general’s report did not reach a conclusion to whether Cuomo’s conduct should amount to criminal charges. The woman who filed a criminal complaint against him has accused the governor of groping her under her blouse."
politics,Lawyers for a global activist organization are keeping up their pressure for a “McMafia” law order in Scotland to force former President Donald Trump to reveal the sources for his all-cash purchases and development of his two Scottish golf resorts.
politics,"Springham then highlighted the charges filed in Manhattan last month against the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg. Prosecutors alleged a 15-year tax scheme to defraud the city, state and federal government by concealing the salaries of top company executives. A grand jury indictment said Weisselberg had hidden more than $1.7 million of his own income. The company and Weisselberg pleaded not guilty on all charges."
politics,"“It’s evident from the matters set out in the petition that there are real and substantial concerns about financial arrangements of the Trump Organization, of which Mr. Trump is the sole or principal owner,” Kay Springham, a lawyer for the U.S.-based nonprofit Avaaz, argued last week in a virtual hearing before Scotland’s highest civil court, The Scotsman reported."
politics,The lawyers are citing an ongoing investigation and recent charges against the Trump Organization by New York prosecutors as part of a new push to probe Trump’s clubs in Aberdeenshire and Ayrshire.
politics,The charges are widely believed to be the first of others likely to be filed against the company and officers. 
politics,"Springham is seeking an extension to a three-month time limit to bring a full case before the court, arguing for the order after the Scottish Parliament voted in February against a Green Party motion to force Trump to reveal the sources of his cash."
politics,"Avaaz initially filed a petition in May to pursue an “Unexplained Wealth Order” against Trump’s businesses under the so-called “McMafia law,” passed in 2018 to investigate financial crimes such as money-laundering often carried out by the mob."
politics,"Judge Lord Sandison said that as far as the issues raised by the petition were concerned, they passed the test set out by the law, so he was convinced “there is enough to have a sensible argument” about the matters set out in the petition, The Scotsman reported. But he must still rule on extending the deadline to present the full case."
politics,Trump triggered suspicions when he purchased land in Aberdeenshire in 2006 and then the Turnberry resort in 2014 in all-cash transactions at a time when he was seriously strapped for cash and couldn’t find banks willing to lend him money.
politics,"They haven’t paid a cent in taxes to the Scottish government. In fact, Trump’s resorts collected some $800,000 in COVID-19 subsidies from British taxpayers. "
politics,"Trump’s Scottish resorts have yet to turn a declared profit — despite the millions of dollars he has pumped into them. The resorts, according to the Trump Organization, lost about $75 million in eight years through 2019."
politics,"Trump bought more than 1,000 acres in Aberdeenshire in 2006 for more than $10 million. He spent at least $60 million more building a course, hotel and cottages, according to company filings. The Trump Organization has said in statements and filings that it has spent a total of more than $140 million on the complex, noted Reuters."
politics,"In 2014, Trump bought the Turnberry resort in Ayrshire for $60 million, again all cash. According to U.K. filings, the Trump Organization spent $100 million more in cash on upgrades and other expenses.Tracking money in the former president’s Scottish resorts is difficult because Trump is the creditor for his own businesses, which means payment for many of the resorts’ costs flow right back to the Trump Organization.That circular flow of money within the Trump network provides an opportunity for money laundering, The New Yorker business writer Adam Davidson has suggested. He called the resorts “money disappearing” operations.Trump “owns the asset, lends the money, owes the money, is owed the money,” Davidson explained. “Every year, Trump lends millions to himself, spends all that money on something, and claims the asset is worth all the money he spent.”"
politics,"GREENVILLE, Calif. (AP) — After four years of homelessness, Kesia Studebaker thought she finally landed on her feet when she found a job cooking in a diner and moved into a house in the small community of Greenville."
politics,"She had been renting for three months and hoped the stability would help her win back custody of her 14-year-old daughter. But in just one night, a raging wildfire tore through the mountain town and “took it all away,” she said."
politics,"Fueled by strong winds and bone-dry vegetation, the Dixie Fire grew to become the largest single wildfire in state history. Residents of the scenic forestlands of Northern California are facing a weekend of fear as it threatens to reduce thousands of homes to ashes."
politics,"“We knew we didn’t get enough rainfall and fires could happen, but we didn’t expect a monster like this,” Studebaker said Saturday."
politics,"The Dixie Fire, named for the road where it started, spanned an area of 700 square miles Saturday night and was just 21% contained, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection."
politics,"The fire incinerated much of Greenville on Wednesday and Thursday, destroying 370 homes and structures and threatening nearly 14,000 buildings in the northern Sierra Nevada. It had engulfed an area larger than the size of New York City."
politics,"Four firefighters were taken to the hospital Friday after being struck by a fallen branch. More 20 people were initially reported missing, but by Saturday afternoon authorities had contacted all but four of them."
politics,Cooler overnight temperatures and higher humidity slowed the spread of the fire and temperatures topped 90 degrees instead of the triple-digit highs recorded earlier in the week.
politics,The fire’s cause was under investigation. The Pacific Gas & Electric utility has said it may have been sparked when a tree fell on one of its power lines. A federal judge ordered PG&E on Friday to give details by Aug. 16 about the equipment and vegetation where the fire started.
politics,"But the blaze and its neighboring fires, within several hundred miles of each other, posed an ongoing threat."
politics,Studebaker sought shelter at an evacuation center before setting up her tent in a friend’s front yard.
politics,"She is counting on returning to her job if the restaurant where she works stays open. Her boss also evacuated when the town of Chester, northwest of Greenville, lost power and the smoke was so thick that it made it hard to breathe."
politics,Heat waves and historic drought tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in the American West. Scientists have said climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make the weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.
politics,"Near the Klamath National Forest, firefighters kept a close watch on small communities that were ordered evacuated in the path of the Antelope Fire, which earlier threw up flames 100 feet high as it blackened bone-dry grass, brush and timber. It was just 20% contained.
Further northwest, about 500 homes scattered in and around Shasta-Trinity National Forest remained threatened by the Monument Fire and others by the McFarland Fire, both started by lightning storms last week, fire officials said.
About a two-hour drive south from the Dixie Fire, crews had surrounded nearly half of the River Fire that broke out Wednesday near the town of Colfax and destroyed 68 homes and other buildings. Evacuation orders for thousands of people in Nevada and Placer counties were lifted Friday. Three people, including a firefighter, were injured, authorities said.
Smoke from the fires blanketed Northern California and western Nevada, causing air quality to deteriorate to very unhealthy and, at times, hazardous levels.
Air quality advisories extended through the California’s San Joaquin Valley and as far as the San Francisco Bay Area to Denver, Salt Lake City and Las Vegas, where residents were urged to keep their windows and doors shut. Denver’s air quality ranked among the worst in the world Saturday afternoon.
California’s fire season is on track to surpass last year’s season, which was the worst fire season in recent recorded state history.
Since the start of the year, more than 6,000 blazes have destroyed more than 1,260 square miles of land — more than triple the losses for the same period in 2020, according to state fire figures.
California’s raging wildfires were among 107 large fires burning across 14 states, mostly in the West, where historic drought conditions have left lands parched and ripe for ignition.

politics,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A woman who accused Gov. Andrew Cuomo of groping her breast at the governor’s state residence filed a criminal complaint against him, the Albany County Sheriff’s office said Friday."
politics,Albany County Sheriff Craig Apple told the New York Post that it is possible the Democratic governor could be arrested if investigators or the county district attorney determine he committed a crime.
politics,"The complaint, filed Thursday with the sheriff’s office, is the first known instance where a woman has made an official report with a law enforcement agency over alleged misconduct by Cuomo."
politics,Apple didn’t immediately return a phone message from The Associated Press. His office confirmed to The AP that the report had been filed.
politics,"“The end result could either be it sounds substantiated and an arrest is made and it would be up to the DA to prosecute the arrest,” he told the newspaper, which was the first to report on the complaint. “Just because of who it is we are not going to rush it or delay it,” Apple said."
politics,The Cuomo aide who filed the report has accused him of reaching under her shirt and fondling her when they were alone together at the Executive Mansion last year.
politics,An independent investigation overseen by the state attorney general’s office this week found Cuomo sexually harassed 11 women and worked to retaliate against one of his accusers.
politics,"Prosecutors in several New York counties have said they are interested in investigating claims of inappropriate touching by Cuomo, but all had said they needed the women involved in the allegations to make a formal report."
politics,"The sheriff’s office didn’t immediately provide a copy of the complaint. A request for comment was sent to Cuomo’s lawyer, Rita Glavin."
politics,Cuomo has denied touching anyone inappropriately and said the alleged groping encounter didn’t happen.
politics,The woman also told investigators with the attorney general’s office that Cuomo once rubbed her rear end while they were posing together for a photo.
politics,"Pulaski County Circuit Jude Tim Fox on Thursday issued a preliminary injunction against the law Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed in April. Fox’s decision came shortly after Arkansas lawmakers left the ban in place, ending a session Hutchinson called to consider rolling it back for some schools."
politics,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) — An Arkansas judge has temporarily blocked the state from enforcing a law that prevents schools and other governmental agencies from requiring masks."
politics,THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.
politics,Hutchinson said the change was needed to protect children under 12 who can’t get vaccinated as the state’s virus cases and hospitalizations skyrocket.
politics,The majority-Republican Legislature adjourned the special session that GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson had called to consider rolling back the ban for some schools. Hutchinson signed the ban in April but said the change was needed to protect children under 12 who can’t get vaccinated as the state’s virus cases and hospitalizations skyrocket.
politics,"Arkansas lawmakers on Friday left the state’s mask mandate ban in place, ending a session called to revisit the prohibition for schools because of the state’s COVID-19 surge."
politics,"There had been growing calls to lift the ban before school starts statewide later this month. The ban is already being challenged in two lawsuits, including one from an east Arkansas school district where more than 800 students and staff have quarantined because of a COVID-19 outbreak."
politics,A House panel on Thursday rejected two measures to allow some school districts to issue mask requirements.
politics,"“I think we’re going to come to really regret not taking action,” Democratic Sen. Keith Ingram, the chamber’s minority leader, said. “I just hope the consequences aren’t fatal for children or staff or teachers in this state.”"
politics,"Pediatricians and health officials have said that masks in schools are needed to protect children, as the delta variant and Arkansas’ low vaccination rate fuels the state’s spiraling cases. The state on Monday reported its biggest one-day increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations since the pandemic began, and the Department of Health on Thursday said only 36 intensive care unit beds were available in the state."
politics,"Opponents of lifting the ban who testified before the Legislature repeatedly cited false and discredited claims about the virus, including a woman who falsely suggested COVID-19 doesn’t exist."
politics,"But Hutchinson faced heavy opposition from fellow Republicans, who had been inundated with calls and messages from opponents of masks in schools."
politics,"Hutchinson said this week he regretted signing the mask mandate ban, telling reporters that “in hindsight, I wish that had not become law.” Hutchinson noted he did so when the state’s cases were much lower and that the Legislature could have easily overridden him had he vetoed the measure."
politics,"The Republican sponsor of the mandate ban said he thinks the state needs to focus on other ways to address outbreaks in schools, such as leave for teachers who have to quarantine."
politics,"“You try to talk to someone about this, but there’s so much misinformation that’s out there you have to try to dispel that and then they’ll go to another one and do that and you’ve got to do that all the way down to keep them from getting upset at you before you can ever talk to them about it,” Republican Senate President Jimmy Hickey said."
politics,"“What I don’t want is this false sense of security that masks seem to be providing because it’s an easy political tool,” said Republican Sen. Trent Garner. “Let’s come up with the real solutions when this happens in our schools, and I think we’re woefully inadequate on that.”"
politics,"A state judge last week ordered Arkansas to resume the payment, ruling that Hutchinson didn’t appear to have the authority on his own to cut off the payments. Hutchinson was among more than two dozen GOP governors who ended their states’ participation in the federally funded payments, which were scheduled to run through early September."
politics,"The House and Senate on Friday gave final approval to the only other item on the session’s agenda, legislation aimed at preventing the state from resuming supplemental unemployment insurance payments to 69,000 people in the state."
politics,"Conspiracy theory-endorsing Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) faced backlash after she told an audience in Alabama that door-to-door outreach vaccination workers “might not like the welcome they get” because “in the South, we all love our Second Amendment rights,” reported Al.com."
politics,"Guests at an Alabama Federation of Republican Women event in Dothan cheered when the radical right-wing lawmaker praised their state for having one of the nation’s lowest vaccination rates, according to a video secretly recorded at the private July 23 event that radio host David Pakman shared on Twitter Tuesday."
politics,"“You lucky people in Alabama might get a knock on your door because I hear Alabama might be one of the most unvaccinated states in the nation,” Greene told the audience, eliciting cheers."
politics,"“Well, Joe Biden wants to come talk to you guys,” she continued, an apparent reference to the president’s door-to-door idea to encourage unvaccinated people to get the shot amid a new wave of infections. "
politics,"Greene suggested Biden would send “one of his police state friends to your front door, to knock on the door, take down your name, your address, your family members’ names, your phone numbers, your cellphone numbers, probably ask for your Social Security number, and whether you’ve taken the vaccine or not.”"
politics,"“Yeah, well, what they don’t know is in the South we all love our Second Amendment rights,” she added. “And we’re not real big on strangers showing up at our front door, are we? They might not like the welcome they get.”"
politics,Rep. Ted Lieu (D-Calif.) accused Greene of “encouraging violence” with her comments.
politics,"“FYI: It’s murder to shoot someone for knocking on your door,” Lieu tweeted."
politics,"Greene, a follower of the QAnon conspiracy theory and other crackpot ideology, has refused to disclose her vaccination status, falsely suggested vaccines aren’t necessary, likened vaccine mandates to “segregation” and compared House mask mandates to the Holocaust."
politics,An official with knowledge of the plan told Reuters on Wednesday that the White House was eager to reopen U.S. borders to foreign visitors and was working “to have a new system ready for when we can reopen travel.”
politics,The Biden administration is reportedly developing a plan to require nearly all foreign travelers to the U.S. to be fully vaccinated amid the global surge of COVID-19 variants.
politics,"The system would include “a phased approach that over time will mean, with limited exceptions, that foreign nationals traveling to the United States [from all countries] need to be fully vaccinated.”"
politics,NBC News and The New York Times later corroborated the report. 
politics,It remains unclear when the Biden administration intends to lift its pandemic travel restrictions.
politics,"Due to the coronavirus, the U.S. has banned foreign visitors who have been in China, Brazil, India, Iran, Ireland, South Africa, the United Kingdom or 26 Schengen nations in Europe within the past 14 days."
politics,Foreign travelers are also banned from crossing by land into the U.S. from Mexico and Canada unless they are considered essential workers.
politics,"As The New York Times noted, Biden has been facing mounting pressure to lift some of these travel restrictions, particularly as other nations like the United Kingdom and Canada have eased their own restrictions for vaccinated Americans."
politics,"The video, which was posted to Elder’s YouTube page with the same headline, received over 2,000 views."
politics,"The July 7 post, You’ll Want to Hear This Physician’s Take on the Vaccines, includes a YouTube video of Elder’s interview with a caller who opposes the Biden’s administration’s efforts at getting people vaccinated, including going door-to-door in some communities to hand out information about the efficacy of the vaccines."
politics,Elder’s campaign didn’t respond immediately to a request for comment.
politics,"The woman, a gynecologist in Texas, initially expresses concern about the effects of the vaccine on children under 12 and worries it may be “harmful” later in life. She then spouts far-right conspiracy theories about the vaccine effort targeting minorities, invoking the name of billionaire Bill Gates and population control as Elder strokes his chin and moves on without pushing back. "
politics,California Republican gubernatorial front-runner Larry Elder highlighted an interview he did with a COVID-19 vaccine skeptic on his radio show website last month.
politics,"At another point in the interview, the woman says she relies on “protocols” to stay healthy and guard against COVID-19, including vitamins, nebulized hydrogen peroxide and hydroxychloroquine. "
politics,"“He wants population control, so I ultimately don’t have a lot of trust in what they’re doing here,” she says. "
politics,"Elder, who is vaccinated, says it ought to be a person’s choice whether to get vaccinated for COVID-19. He also opposes mandates requiring California state workers to get the vaccine or else get tested regularly."
politics,"Some polls of likely voters in recent days have shown recall supporters within striking distance, generating anxiety among Democrats in and out of the state. At stake in the race is not only a governorship in a deep blue state but perhaps also the control of the U.S. Senate."
politics,"A conservative figure with hard-right views, Elder is currently leading a large field of candidates running to become the next governor of California. Elder could become governor if California voters decide to boot Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) in the Sept. 14 recall election. Recall supporters must win 51% of the vote to do so."
politics,"In a sign the race is heating up, Newsom blasted Elder in a Zoom call with supporters this week, according to The Los Angeles Times."
politics,"“The leading candidate thinks climate change is a hoax, believes we need more offshore oil drilling, more fracking, does not believe a woman has the right to choose [and] actually came out against Roe v. Wade, does not believe in a minimum wage,” Newsom said on the call. "
politics,"Spurred by protests from congressional Democrats, the Biden administration extended a moratorium on evictions for renters whose livelihoods have been hurt by the coronavirus pandemic. "
politics,"The 60-day continuation of the eviction ban is partly a recognition that the pandemic isn’t over, with virus variants still surging among the unvaccinated. But extra unemployment benefits ― one of the federal government’s foremost responses to the pandemic ― will still expire on schedule after Labor Day. "
politics,"More than 7 million jobless workers will lose benefits after Sept. 6, according to an analysis published Thursday by The Century Foundation, a liberal think tank. "
politics,"“With the U.S. economy still short 6.5 million jobs as of the end of June 2021, the end of the pandemic unemployment benefits will be an abrupt jolt to millions of Americans who won’t find a job in time for this arbitrary end to assistance,” writes TCF’s Andrew Stettner."
politics,"Unlike with the eviction moratorium, there has been virtually no interest from congressional Democrats to continue the federal jobless benefits, which include an extra $300 per week plus benefits for gig workers and the long-term jobless. The House of Representatives is on recess until September, and the Senate will soon adjourn. "
politics,"The White House has not urged lawmakers to take action, as it did with the eviction moratorium before taking its own administrative action. President Joe Biden previously said “it makes sense” that the extra $300 expires when it does."
politics,"Many people whose federal benefits expire may still be eligible for state-funded benefits, noted Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). And the eviction ban protects people from homelessness, pretty much the direst economic situation imaginable. "
politics,"“I think we’re trying to find a transition from a pandemic economy to a more fully employed economy,” Durbin told HuffPost on Thursday.“And there are several things we can deal with, but when it comes to eviction, when you’re out on the street with all your belongings, that’s a desperate situation that we just want to try to avoid.”"
politics,"More than 4 million of the people facing the September unemployment cutoff will not revert to state benefits, according to Stettner, since they are receiving the special benefits Congress created last year for the many workers who are not eligible for traditional jobless aid, such as gig workers and the self-employed. "
politics,"When the gig worker program lapses, the unemployment system will revert to its normal self — a rickety patchwork of state agencies that protect a shrinking percentage of the workforce and were hopelessly vulnerable to massive fraud when tasked by Congress with delivering emergency benefits. "
politics,"Democrats have said they want to overhaul the system with stronger federal oversight, but haven’t signaled that doing so will be a priority in upcoming legislation. Instead, lawmakers considered stricter fraud controls in an upcoming infrastructure bill, though they ultimately abandoned the idea. "
politics,"Nationally, the September cutoff won’t be nearly as drastic as it could have been ― because 26 states led by Republican governors already canceled the benefits. They did so as a sop to employers who have struggled to hire workers at prevailing wages as the economy reopened this summer. Republicans and business owners said cutting the benefits would spur more people to take jobs. "
politics,The former data chief for Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign has announced a protest next month at the nation’s Capitol — to rail on behalf of so-called “political prisoners” charged in the Jan. 6 insurrection.
politics,"It’s not clear if cutting benefits has helped hiring. The early cutoffs in red states shrank the benefit rolls but “doesn’t seem to have translated into most of these individuals having jobs in the first 2-3 weeks following expiration,” according to an early analysis of federal survey data by Arindrajit Dube, an economist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. “However, there is evidence that the reduced UI benefits increased self-reported hardship in paying for regular expenses.”"
politics,"“We’re going back to the Capitol, right where it started. And it’s going to be huge,” Matt Braynard told former White House strategist Steve Bannon as he announced the rally on Bannon’s podcast last week. "
politics,"The protest, “Justice for J6,”has been set for Sept. 18 at the Capitol. It’s being orchestrated by the group Look Ahead America, headed by Braynard. "
politics,"“As we continue to raise the profiles of these individuals” who have been arrested, it “makes it harder and harder for the left’s phony narrative about an insurrection to stick,” Braynard told Bannon. “We’re going to push back on the phony narrative that there was an insurrection.”"
politics,"Despite multiple dramatic videos of scenes to the contrary, Braynard told Bannon the crowd that day was “largely peaceful” — and simply “egged on in many cases by the Capitol Police.”"
politics,Braynard promised that “high-profile” speakers including members of Congress would attend the rally.He declined to reveal their identities to HuffPost until “confirmed.”
politics,"One person who met with Trump on Saturday at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, mentioned a “rally” by a “little bit of a special group” — though it wasn’t clear if the person was referring to the new “Justice for J6” protest."
politics,"Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) posted and then deleted a clip of that comment a day after former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows announced that Trump was meeting with “Cabinet members” — apparently as part of some imagined parallel presidency — to make “real” plans for the future. Trump is, of course, no longer president and has no real Cabinet. "
politics,"Braynard said he has already obtained permission for the rally from the Metropolitan Police Department, pending final checks the day of the protest."
politics,Braynard told HuffPost he was unaware of that meeting or the video. He later clarified that the “rally” mentioned in the clip had nothing to do with his.
politics,An MPD spokesperson would not confirm to HuffPost that a permit had been approved. A Capitol Police spokesperson said the department is aware of the rally but cannot discuss a permit or security plans.
politics,"The rally is planned for the West Lawn of the Capitol, where protesters moved on the building after Trump told them to go there and “fight much harder.”"
politics,"Braynard told HuffPost the rally is only in support of “nonviolent” Capitol protesters. That includes Ashli Babbit, who crawled through a broken window in a barricaded door to get to members of Congress. As a mob of rioters yelled “Let’s go” and “Fuck the blue,” a Capitol Police officer warned Babbit to stop before he fatally shot her. (The incident can be seen in a disturbing video here.)"
politics,Braynard claimed that Babbit had been “executed.” The officer who shot her has been cleared of any wrongdoing.
politics,"Braynard said the rally will focus on arrests linked to the Jan. 6 storming of the Capitol and will discourage protesters from holding signs about any election or candidates and will also discourage the use of “MAGA gear.” Asked if his group had been active on behalf of any peaceful “political prisoners” arrested at Black Lives Matter protests, he said: “I don’t know anything about that.”"
politics,"Amid talk of coming protests and Trump’s “reinstatement,” security officials fear a repeat of the Capitol insurrection or even more serious domestic terrorism. "
politics,"Nevertheless, Lindell believes that after Trump makes his case, the court could decide to order an election do-over. Maybe “that’s a thing,” he added."
politics,"Trump disciple and My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell initially said that the former president would somehow be reinstated to the White House in mid-August. He revised that prediction in an interview with a far-right-wing radio program last week, claiming instead that Trump will present “proof” next month to the Supreme Court that the election was “stolen by the Chinese.” No credible evidence has yet emerged to support this."
politics,It’s not.
politics,"The Justice Department has opened an investigation to determine whether the city of Phoenix and the Phoenix Police Department have violated civil rights laws, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced Thursday."
politics,"As part of the probe ― known as a pattern-or-practice investigation ― investigators will look at the types of force used by Phoenix police officers, as well as whether the department has violated the rights of citizens."
politics,"The probe includes determining if officers use excessive force, engage in retaliatory behavior against people expressing their First Amendment rights, or unlawfully seize belongings of the homeless. It will also assess practices for responding to people with disabilities."
politics,"“The investigation will include a comprehensive review of PhxPD policies, training, supervision, and force investigations, as well as PhxPD’s systems of accountability, including misconduct complaint intake, investigation, review, disposition, and discipline,” the Justice Department said in a statement."
politics,The Justice Department also announced it will reach out to community groups and members of the public to hear about their experiences with the Phoenix Police Department.
politics,Phoenix police must now track every time they point guns at people. The change came after a 2019 incident in which an officer was caught on video pointing his gun at a Black family after the couple’s 4-year-old daughter walked out of a store with a doll that hadn’t been paid for.
politics,"“I’m gonna put a cap right in your fucking head,” the officer could be heard saying on the video."
politics,"Pattern-or-practice investigations into police departments all but ended under former President Donald Trump, as his administration argued in part that revealing patterns of misconduct in police departments hurts officer morale. President Joe Biden’s administration has brought them back. It recently announced an investigation in Louisville, Kentucky, where Breonna Taylor, a Black woman, was killed in her own home by police. Another has been opened in Minneapolis, where Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, murdered George Floyd, a Black man. "
politics,A report also found that Phoenix police were involved in a record-breaking 44 shootings in 2018.
politics,"The city of Phoenix later paid the family $475,000 in a settlement."
politics,Louisiana has the country’s highest number of COVID-19 cases per capita and one of the lowest vaccination rates right now. And the situation for hospitals and health care workers has never been worse.
politics,"Landry attached two form letters that parents could use to request either a philosophical or religious exemption to the policies, which are intended to limit the spread of the pandemic."
politics,"“Louisiana law offers broad and robust protections for students’ and parents’ religious and philosophical objections to certain state public health policies,” Landry wrote in the email, a copy of which was obtained by the Louisiana Illuminator. “I support your religious liberties and right to conscientiously object.”"
politics,"On Monday, as the state’s coronavirus death toll topped 11,000, Landry sent an email to state Department of Justice employees informing them how to avoid complying with school mask mandates for children. He also advised how to circumvent K-12 vaccine requirements, though the state doesn’t have any."
politics,State Attorney General Jeff Landry (R) is doing his part to keep it that way.
politics,"The attorney general’s office also made both letters available for download on social media, cautioning that they don’t actually represent legal advice."
politics,"“I do not consent to forcing a face covering on my child, who is created in the image of God,” the letter requesting a religious exemption states. “Masks lead to anti-social behaviors, interfere with religious commands to share God’s love with others, and interfere with relationships in contravention of the Bible.”"
politics,The memo was sent just hours before Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) restored a statewide indoor mask mandate as the coronavirus delta variant tightens its grip.
politics,"“Nobody should be laboring under the misapprehension that this is just another surge,” Edwards said in announcing the mask rule restoration. “This is the worst one we’ve had.”"
politics,Landry spokesperson Millard Mule didn’t respond to an email from HuffPost about Landry’s memo or his vaccination status.
politics,Landry has been mentioned as a potential GOP contender in the 2023 gubernatorial election. Edwards can’t run again because of term limits.
politics,"The Gold Medal, the nation’s highest congressional honor, will be awarded to the Capitol Police and to Washington, D.C.’s Metropolitan Police Department. A third Gold Medal will be given to the Smithsonian Institution, to be put on display with a plaque that lists all the law enforcement agencies that defended the Capitol. A fourth will be awarded to the Architect of the Capitol, the federal agency that maintains the building."
politics,President Joe Biden signed a bill Thursday to award Congressional Gold Medals to police departments that responded to the deadly Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.
politics,"Five people died during or soon after the attack, and 140 officers were injured. Four officers later died by suicide. Testimony given by multiple officers who responded to the attack described the racism and violence that permeated that day."
politics,"Biden signed the bill following a unanimous vote in the Senate on Wednesday to move forward with the honor. Senators voted unanimously in February to give a Gold Medal to Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, who was captured on video by HuffPost’s Igor Bobic leading a violent mob of Donald Trump supporters away from the Senate chamber the day of the attack."
politics,"Democrats in Congress have a plan for their summer vacation: talk about President Joe Biden’s economic agenda, and then talk about it again and again and again."
politics,"The latest sign of this strategy, which Democratic and progressive groups are backing with tens of millions of dollars in television ads, is a new memo the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee sent to campaigns this week in which it outlined preferred messaging for the party’s candidates over the next month."
politics,"Democrats, who have thin majorities in both chambers of Congress, view the popularity of their economic agenda ― which spans everything from a child tax credit worth up to $300 a month to investments in broadband to corporate tax hikes — as key to staving off or limiting the gains parties out of power typically make during midterm election years."
politics,"“Research shows that Democrats have an effective message regarding their legislative agenda and accomplishments, including: cutting taxes, growing jobs through investments in infrastructure and lowering health care costs,” pollsters at the Democratic data firm OpenLabs wrote in the memo, which was obtained by HuffPost. “Additionally, it’s particularly effective to highlight the contrast between Democrats and Republicans, who oppose these proposals while looking out for corporations and wealthy special interests.”"
politics,"Republicans, meanwhile, are focusing their rhetorical energy on social and cultural issues, including crime and the large number of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. "
politics,"Democrats control the 50-50 Senate thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris’ ability to break tie votes. Four of their incumbents — Sens. Mark Kelly (Ariz.), Raphael Warnock (Ga.), Maggie Hassan (N.H.) and Catherine Cortez Masto (Nev.) — are seen as potentially vulnerable. Democrats are also targeting GOP-held seats in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania."
politics,"For women, Black voters, people who supported Donald Trump and white voters without college degrees, the memo recommends a message focused on cutting health care costs and improving health care for seniors — references to Democratic proposals to increase Obamacare subsidies and provide dental and vision coverage through Medicare."
politics,"When it comes to persuading Trump voters, the memo recommends a China-focused message built around promising that Democrats will “bring jobs back from overseas, and will help us compete with countries like China that threaten our economy.” "
politics,"For white voters with a college degree and Biden voters, the memo suggests “making big corporations and the wealthy special interests who rig the rules pay their fair share” as a compelling message."
politics,"Echoing other Democratic research, the memo argues senators should explicitly note how Democrats’ plans would be paid for. “Discussing how Democrats’ proposals are paid for is not simply a technical detail, but a core part of our plan’s popularity,” the memo’s authors write."
politics,"The memo is based on a survey of 4,894 voters in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. "
politics,"Biden’s agenda is split between a piece of legislation supported by members of both parties, which is expected to pass the Senate this week, and legislation crafted exclusively by Democrats that the party will work on over the coming months. "
politics,"A Quinnipiac University poll released this week found that just 43% of voters supported Biden’s handling of the economy, with 48% disapproving. But the same survey found just under two-thirds of Americans support both the bipartisan and Democrat-only legislation implementing Biden’s agenda."
politics,"Groups allied with Biden, including the White House-sanctioned political nonprofit Building Back Together, plan to spend $100 million on television and digital ads with similar messages. The goal is to both build support for the plan and to improve the public’s perception of Biden’s handling of the economy."
politics,"GOP groups, meanwhile, are launching their own ad campaigns to test anti-Biden messaging. Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC controlled by House Republican leadership, is running digital ads on two social issues — rising crime and the use of “critical race theory” in schools — and on inflation, an economic issue Republicans have increasingly focused on."
politics,"The push comes amid a dramatic surge in cases, with new infections rising in every state in the country and some hospitals reporting they are running out of beds."
politics,"The Food and Drug Administration could unveil a nationwide strategy on COVID-19 booster vaccines as early as next month amid the ongoing surge in new infections linked to the highly transmissible delta variant of the virus, according to reports."
politics,"About half of the country has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Inoculations remain the most effective way to prevent severe cases of the coronavirus or death associated with the disease, including against the delta strain. A small group of vaccinated people have reported breakthrough infections of COVID-19, but very few require hospitalization or die. Almost all of the nation’s deaths over the past months have been among unvaccinated people."
politics,"The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the agency’s discussions, first reported that the administration of President Joe Biden is working quickly to develop policies around booster shots amid concern about the ongoing length of the pandemic and if those who are vaccinated will remain protected, particularly Americans that are more susceptible to severe infection."
politics,"Both Pfizer and Moderna have reported their inoculations providing lasting protection against severe cases of the coronavirus, but studies have shown vaccines’ effectiveness at preventing symptomatic infection can diminish over time. The companies have said in recent months they expect booster shots will be needed to improve immunity for the foreseeable future as the pandemic continues, a reality that could result in billions of dollars in additional vaccine sales."
politics,"There is no clear scientific consensus yet on if boosters will be needed, but public health officials have expressed concern about variants like the delta strain and others that could evolve in the future. The Wall Street Journal added that the FDA is investigating if a multi-course vaccine regimen, like the four-shot program for poliovirus, could result in lifelong immunity or a much longer protection period."
politics,"Germany and Israel have said in recent days they will provide booster jabs to subsets of the population considered vulnerable to severe infection, namely older residents and those with compromised immune systems."
politics,"“I understand the concern of all governments to protect their people from the delta variant,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s director-general, said at a news briefing on Wednesday. “But we cannot — and we should not — accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it, while the world’s most vulnerable people remain unprotected.”"
politics,"The World Health Organization expressed alarm, however, with western nations’ focus on booster jabs this week as many middle- and lower-income nations have yet to vaccinate large swaths of their populations. The group said more than 80% of the vaccines delivered so far have gone to high- and upper-middle-income countries, and WHO’s leader said those who already have advanced vaccination campaigns should help deploy vaccines worldwide so lower-income nations can inoculate at least 10% of their populations. "
politics,SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Health officials in San Francisco and six other Bay Area counties announced Monday that they are reinstating a mask mandate for all indoor settings as COVID-19 infections surge because of the highly contagious delta variant.
politics,"The new mandate — which applies to everyone, regardless of their vaccination status — will take effect on Tuesday in San Francisco, Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Sonoma counties and in the city of Berkeley."
politics,The health officers also recommended that people gather outdoors if they have that option.
politics,"“The virus doesn’t care what type of indoor space you’re in,” said Dr. George Han, deputy health officer in Santa Clara. “There is a risk that you could get in contact with the virus that causes COVID-19.”"
politics,"Indoor mask mandates are already in effect in Los Angeles, Yolo and Sacramento counties."
politics,"In line with guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, California last week recommended that everyone wear masks indoors regardless of vaccination status, but officials stopped short of requiring it."
politics,The San Francisco Bay Area’s health officers were the first in the nation to announce a shutdown at the start of the pandemic.
politics,MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell’s election conspiracy theories got debunked right to his face during an at-times wild interview with CNN’s Drew Griffin that aired Thursday.
politics,"Lindell, one of the highest-profile peddlers of ex-President Donald Trump’s election lies, attempted to convince Griffin that Trump actually beat President Joe Biden last year."
politics,"But Griffin, citing cyberexperts who analyzed Lindell’s alleged evidence for CNN, told him straight: He had “proof of nothing.”"
politics,"“I don’t think you really understand how votes are cast, collected and tabulated in this country,” Griffin said at another point."
politics,Lindell repeatedly shouted at Griffin that Trump won.
politics,"He also suggested a hug with the reporter, before later shouting at him again."
politics,Griffin told Lindell he “could possibly be the victim of a scam here.”
politics,Watch the interview here:
politics,"Lindell, who last month pulled ads from Fox News after it refused to air one of his conspiracy theory-filled promos, then begged Griffin to trust him."
politics,"“I’m not convinced he knows how voting works,” Griffin told CNN anchor Anderson Cooper afterward."
politics,"The debt ceiling officially expired at the end of July, but so-called extraordinary measures undertaken by the Treasury Department will allow the government to issue new debt for two to three additional months. That gives lawmakers some time to avoid a breach, a doomsday scenario that would result in catastrophic economic consequences."
politics,"The full faith and credit of the United States is being threatened once more as Congress debates how to raise the debt limit, which restricts the total amount of money that the federal government can legally borrow."
politics,Here we go again.
politics,"Congress last raised the debt ceiling in 2019 as part of a huge spending deal. The vote was overwhelmingly bipartisan, with a majority of Senate Republicans, including McConnell, voting aye. But that measure was passed under a Republican president who loved red ink. Now that a Democrat is in the White House again, the GOP is raising alarms about deficits after years of looking the other way when they were in power."
politics,"According to Politico, Senate Democrats are not planning to include a provision lifting the debt ceiling in their upcoming budget resolution, which serves as a blueprint for their $3.5 trillion spending package. The measure wouldn’t add to the deficit entirely: Democrats plan to offset part of the cost by raising taxes on corporations and wealthy Americans, as well as by enacting reforms to the federal prescription drug program, which is projected to yield billions in savings."
politics,"“Let me make something perfectly clear: If they don’t need or want our input, they won’t get our help. They won’t get our help with the debt limit increase … that these reckless plans will require,” McConnell said in a floor speech, denouncing the proposed package of spending on climate, health care, housing and more."
politics,"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday said Democrats should lift the debt ceiling on their own if they intend to pass a $3.5 trillion reconciliation bill, vowing they would receive no GOP help to do so."
politics,"“That’s total bullshit. It’s total crap. I think it should be a joint effort,” Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) said Thursday when asked about McConnell’s position."
politics,"Forcing Democrats to address the issue on their own through the reconciliation process, which allows them to avoid a filibuster, could also make some of the party’s more moderate members uncomfortable. Already, some moderates, including those facing reelection next year, have expressed unease with the planned $3.5 trillion cost of the reconciliation package."
politics,But other members of the Democratic caucus sounded open to the idea of addressing a debt limit hike unilaterally via reconciliation.
politics,"“He thinks somehow there will be a better TV ad out there for some Republican [candidate] if he can threaten to push the U.S. into a debt default. That is irresponsible and dangerous,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said of McConnell."
politics,"But the move would almost certainly set up another high-stakes game of chicken over the debt limit. In 2011, Republicans employed the same strategy, pushing the economy to the brink by holding the debt ceiling hostage under President Barack Obama’s administration. The resulting legislative crisis resulted in the long-term credit rating of the U.S. government being downgraded for the first time in history."
politics,"“It’s not an unreasonable suggestion. It’s certainly one we ought to consider,” Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) told HuffPost."
politics,Salesforce did not respond to HuffPost’s queries. Neither did representatives for Trump and the RNC.
politics,WASHINGTON ― Internet giant Salesforce.com accepted a $2.7 million payment from one of Donald Trump’s political committees the day after the former president incited a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol ― and a few days before Salesforce claimed it would not permit its services to be used “in any way that could lead to violence.”
politics,"On Jan. 11, Salesforce claimed it had “taken action” to head off the sort of violence that Trump had incited in part by using its company’s hardware and software."
politics,"Yet within days, the RNC resumed using Salesforce to send out fundraising emails with messaging that built on Trump’s lies about election fraud and downplayed the Jan. 6 attack."
politics,"The company collected $2.65 million on Jan. 7 from the Trump Make America Great Again Committee for “email services,” according to its recent filing with the Federal Election Commission, less than 24 hours after Trump’s last-ditch attempt to overthrow democracy."
politics,"An email sent Wednesday by Trump’s “Save America” committee ― whose funds Trump can legally use for almost any purpose he wants, including picking up his personal expenses or paying him a salary ― asked recipients: “Do you agree President Trump is the only leader who can Save America?”"
politics,"On Feb. 8, for example, the RNC, using Salesforce servers, contacted its tens of millions of email subscribers. “This impeachment SCAM is completely UNCONSTITUTIONAL,” it said of the Senate trial for Trump’s incitement of the insurrection. “We want to raise 1 MILLION DOLLARS in the NEXT 24 HOURS and put an END to this impeachment HOAX.”"
politics,"“We are all deeply troubled by the terrible events of January 6. And while we all hope that they are never repeated, sadly there remains a risk of politically incited violence across the country,” Salesforce said in a statement. “The Republican National Committee has been a long-standing customer, predating the current Administration, and we have taken action to prevent its use of our services in any way that could lead to violence.” "
politics,"It was sent through Salesforce servers, as were many hundreds of emails sent prior to Jan. 6 that spread Trump’s lies about the election, and dozens more after Jan. 6 by Trump and the RNC that continued with that theme."
politics,"Within days of that statement, the San Francisco-based company was distributing tens of millions of emails for the Republican National Committee that continued amplifying Trump’s lies about election fraud that led to the insurrection in the first place. And it is now servicing Trump’s “leadership” committee, even as he has ramped up his falsehoods about his reelection having been stolen from him."
politics,"On April 3, the RNC sent out an email claiming: “If MILLIONS of Patriots do not take a stand for Election Integrity TODAY, we may not be able to stop the Radical Left from undermining our Constitutional Right to FREE and FAIR Elections.”"
politics,"Two days later, the RNC wrote: “They’re trying to HALT conservatives in Georgia from securing future elections with common-sense voter ID laws. This could lead to MASSIVE FRAUD!” The second sentence was in bright red capital letters."
politics,"The details of the contract between Salesforce, a 56,000-employee, $230 billion company, and Trump and the RNC are not publicly available. However, one official close to the RNC said the Jan. 7 payment was in advance of an expected 10 billion fundraising emails in the coming year."
politics,"Trump Make America Great Again Committee, which paid Salesforce, is a joint fundraising venture between Save America and the RNC. On Jan. 7, it was essentially under Trump’s control, as head of his party, with 75% of every dollar raised going to Save America and 25% to the RNC. While the committee and the agreement still exist, an RNC official told HuffPost recently that it is in the “wind-down phase” and that the RNC is no longer soliciting money for it."
politics,"Trump spent weeks attacking the legitimacy of the Nov. 3 election he lost, starting his lies in the predawn hours of Nov. 4 that he had really won in a “landslide” and that victory was being “stolen” from him. He maintained those falsehoods through a long string of failed lawsuits challenging the results in a handful of states."
politics,"The mob of supporters he incited attempted to do just that by storming the Capitol. They even chanted “Hang Mike Pence” after Pence, Trump’s vice president, refused to comply with Trump’s demands."
politics,"After the Electoral College finally voted on Dec. 14, making Joe Biden’s win official, Trump began urging his followers to come to Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6 to intimidate his own vice president and members of Congress into overturning the election results and installing Trump as president for another term."
politics,"Trump and his allies are now engaged in a campaign to portray the woman who was shot, Ashli Babbitt, as a martyr, and depict the hundreds of others who have been arrested as victims of political persecution."
politics,"Four police officers who responded to the insurrection have since died by suicide. One of the rioters was fatally shot as she climbed through a broken window into an anteroom containing still-evacuating House members, and three others in the crowd died during the melee."
politics,"Nearly 72,000 children tested positive for COVID-19 last week, a “substantial” increase that troubles public health advocates amid the growing wave of infections linked to the highly transmissible delta variant of the virus."
politics,More than 4.2 million children have tested positive for the coronavirus since the pandemic began.
politics,"The American Academy of Pediatrics released the figures on Tuesday, noting they were a nearly 85% increase from a week earlier. Children — defined by individual states as those aged 17 or 18 and under ― now account for 19% of the nation’s weekly COVID-19 cases."
politics,"The data is troubling as many children are not yet eligible for a coronavirus vaccine. Those used in the United States are only authorized for people aged 12 and over, but many schools are preparing to hold in-person classes in the fall for the first time since the pandemic took hold last year."
politics,"The American Academy of Pediatrics noted that severe illness and hospitalization remained uncommon among children. Top vaccine makers are testing their products on children as young as 6 months old, but emergency use authorization is still months away."
politics,"“There is an urgent need to collect more data on longer-term impacts of the pandemic on children, including ways the virus may harm the long-term physical health of infected children, as well as its emotional and mental health effects,” the group said."
politics,"A recent study from scientists in London found that children who are infected with the coronavirus rarely develop long-term illnesses, known colloquially as “long COVID,” suggesting the issue may be more frequent in adults. Researchers found just 4.4% of kids have symptoms that last for four weeks or longer, and just 1.8% have illnesses that go on for more than eight weeks."
politics,"The report comes less than two weeks after the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended all kids over the age of 2 wear face masks in school this fall, regardless of vaccination status, citing the delta variant."
politics,"Vaccines remain the best defense against severe cases of COVID-19 and death associated with the disease, and studies show that all vaccines used in the U.S. protect well against the delta strain. Almost all of the nation’s deaths linked to the pandemic are among unvaccinated Americans, and regions with notably low inoculation rates have seen cases jump dramatically since June."
politics,"The country’s largest LGBTQ rights advocacy group is in turmoil, facing a staff revolt over their president’s connection to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s sexual harassment scandal."
politics,"David publicly called for Cuomo’s resignation in a tweet on Tuesday night. And during the conference call on Wednesday, David told staff that he hadn’t known about the sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo until the report came out."
politics,"In a tense all-staff meeting Wednesday, employees at the Human Rights Campaign laid into Alphonso David for nearly an hour and a half ― and asked him to resign several times. A person on the call shared a recording with HuffPost."
politics,"“I read the report word for word, and it left me sickened to my stomach,” David said. “There’s nowhere in the report where it says that I was aware of any of these allegations.”"
politics,"David was part of Cuomo’s tight inner circle, serving as his counsel from 2015 to 2019."
politics,"The New York attorney general’s office on Tuesday released a bombshell report detailing its investigation into allegations against the Democratic governor, and David appears to have played a significant role in Cuomo’s efforts to discredit his accusers. The report — which is based on conversations with 179 people and more than 74,000 pieces of evidence, including emails, texts, photos and audio files — concluded that Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women and violated federal and state laws."
politics,"“You are creating a toxic environment where partners can’t trust us,” charged one staffer. “When are you resigning?”"
politics,But HRC employees spent most of the call berating David over the report’s findings that tie him to Cuomo’s attempts to smear his accusers and publicly redeem himself.
politics,"The report states, for example, that David provided a confidential file to Cuomo’s top aides, which they used to discredit one of his accusers, Lindsey Boylan. The former Cuomo staffer has accused the governor of sexual harassment including an unsolicited kiss in his office and an invitation to play strip poker on a government airplane."
politics,"“The first question is, what did Alphonso David personally know about Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s harassment of multiple women?” began the moderator, reading from staff submissions. “Was Alphonso David complicit in any way in a cover-up of Gov. Cuomo’s sexual harassment of women?”"
politics,"The report also states that David was involved in discussions about calling and secretly recording a conversation between a former Cuomo staffer and another Cuomo accuser named Kaitlin, who has not provided her last name. Kaitlin claims that in 2016, the governor grabbed her at a fundraiser and put her into a dance pose for photographers, and then two days later, had his staff reach out to her to offer her a job."
politics,"According to the report, David also initially declined to sign onto a letter aimed at discrediting Boylan and attacking her claims as political, but later told a Cuomo aide he would sign the letter “if we need him.” He also agreed to reach out to women who previously worked for Cuomo to try to get them to sign onto a statement saying positive things about the governor, per the report."
politics,David was serving as president of HRC at the time of all these incidents.
politics,"Staffers on the call were given the option to submit questions anonymously, which allowed people to be blunt. Not a single person defended him."
politics,"“I knew nothing. Nothing,” David replied. “No one ever disclosed allegations of harassment with me, either during or after I worked in state service. Also, I never saw anything.”"
politics,"David said the report shows that he declined to sign that letter, and said he never agreed to sign any iteration of the letter."
politics,"Another employee asked: “Do you plan to issue a public apology for agreeing to sign a draft [letter] disparaging an accuser while serving as president of HRC, per the AG’s report?”"
politics,"“What I did agree to do was to talk about my personal experience at the governor’s office,” he said. “But I never agreed to sign a letter that would disparage any employee or any survivor of harassment.”"
politics,"For the next hour, staffers pummeled David with questions about why he turned over Boylan’s confidential file to a Cuomo aide while serving as president of HRC (he said he was legally obligated), why he had that file at all since he didn’t work for Cuomo anymore (he said his file was a copy, not the official state document), whether he stands by his actions (he does), and how to protect HRC’s brand amid the scandal (he vowed to personally respond to all Cuomo-related questions). "
politics,Staff also pressed David on why he should keep his job. 
politics,“Will you be resigning?” asked a staffer.
politics,"“Alphonso, we will band together and take this to the board to request your resignation,” said another employee. “Are you willing to take down our org with you?”"
politics,"“I appreciate that perspective,” David said. “But I hope you can take a closer look at the report, because to suggest otherwise would mean I knew what the report said I didn’t know. I didn’t know any of this. So you’re basically asking me to resign for conduct I didn’t know about.”"
politics,“Is the best way to protect HRC’s brand for Alphonso to step down?” asked another staffer.
politics,"“Actually, I think one of the important lessons here is to highlight how harassment and discriminatory behavior hides in the darkness,” David said. “And how my experience can actually be used to effect change.”"
politics,But the resignation questions just kept coming.
politics,An HRC spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the anger on display in the meeting or about staffers calling for David’s resignation. 
politics,"HRC staffers may be upset with David and his ties to Cuomo, but the board is standing by him. It extended his contract for five more years on Tuesday, a decision that was already in the works but coincidentally landed on the same day the New York attorney general’s report dropped. David is the first person of color to serve as HRC’s president in its 40-year history."
politics,"But the organization is already incurring damage from its decision. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who is openly gay, tweeted Thursday that she won’t accept any campaign donations or support from HRC until David is out."
politics,"“The Human Rights Campaign and Human Rights Campaign Foundation Boards have full confidence in Alphonso David as president of the organization,” HRC Foundation Board chair Jodie Patterson and HRC Board of Directors chair Morgan Cox said in a joint statement."
politics,New legislation from Democratic lawmakers would provide all Americans with an affirmative right to vote and a legal process to secure that right for the first time ― a move that could counter Republican efforts around the country to restrict voting access.
politics,"“In recognition of his extraordinary leadership during extremely challenging times, we were proud to extend his contract to stay on in his role for five more years,” they said. “For the last two years he has been boldly leading the organization as it works to achieve its mission: full equality for all LGBTQ people, in the midst of a global pandemic, a nationwide reckoning on racial justice, and the most important presidential election of our lifetimes.”"
politics,Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) and Sens. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) and Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) introduced the Right to Vote Act on Wednesday.
politics,“He is sometimes called Cuomo Jr.”
politics,"“This is legislation that would ensure that courts respect the right to vote as the fundamental right that it is,” Jones said. “It is the first congressional guarantee of the right to vote in federal elections. It also solves the problem that we are seeing in certain states of election subversion.”"
politics,The bill would affirm Americans’ right to vote by declaring election laws or rules that pose a “severe or discriminatory burden” to be illegitimate ― unless the jurisdiction in question can prove that its proposed law or rule furthers a governmental interest and is the “least restrictive means” of doing so.
politics,"After the meeting ended, one person who was on the call told HuffPost that staffers came away feeling dissatisfied with David’s responses."
politics,"“Alphonso was a great lawyer today, ducking questions and reframing answers. Most people don’t think he answered questions directly. It’s how most people view him,” said this source, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely. “One person pointed out that there was no apology for the entire 90 minutes from him. Not an apology that HRC and its staff is caught up in something because of him and that he was sorry for that.”"
politics,This means states and local jurisdictions would need to provide documented evidence if they want to claim that their restriction of voter access is necessary to provide election integrity or to counter election or voter fraud.
politics,"The Right to Vote Act “will for the first time enshrine the right to vote in Federal statute and allow U.S. citizens to challenge in court any policy that makes it harder for them to participate in elections,” Ossoff said in a statement after announcing the legislation in an appearance on CNN."
politics,"Similarly, the new election subversion laws enacted by Republicans in states like Georgia, which enable partisan actors to alter vote counts and results after the fact, would need to be shown to meet a provable governmental interest and offer the least restrictive means of achieving that interest."
politics,"“Jurisdictions up until this point have gotten away with murder in terms of positing voter fraud that they are never asked to substantiate,” Jones said. His bill, if enacted, would require jurisdictions to provide such proof."
politics,"This Right to Vote Act is meant to fill the gap in voters’ ability to challenge voting restrictions, previously limited by judicial interpretations of the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause. It is also designed to supplement the For the People Act, a sweeping reform bill that would override many voter suppression laws by setting a national standard for voter access in federal elections."
politics,"The Right to Vote Act was first introduced by Jones in the House as an amendment to the For the People Act in March. The amendment was not agreed to in the House, so Jones sought Senate sponsors to introduce it as standalone legislation."
politics,Jones says he is “focused on getting this passed as a standalone bill.” It is possible that it will be included in the final draft of the For the People Act that a handful of Democratic senators and representatives are working on.
politics,"The For the People Act, which passed the House in May and which Senate Republicans filibustered in June, would prevent states from limiting or not allowing early voting, vote-by-mail and same-day voter registration, among other things. But its provisions would not cover things like bans on mobile poll locations or bans on local jurisdictions from accepting funds from nonpartisan outside sources to help run their elections."
politics,"The For the People Act “doesn’t include any catch-all provision applicable to all voting limits ― including ones Congress hasn’t yet imagined,” Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a Harvard law professor and election law expert, wrote at Democracy Docket in May. “The Act thus leaves open the door to novel barriers erected by wily vote suppressors.”"

politics,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration on Thursday granted temporary refuge to people fleeing China’s crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong.Residents of Hong Kong who are in the U.S. and facing deportation will be allowed to remain for at least 18 more months because of what a White House statement called China’s move to “deny basic rights and freedoms.”It comes as relations between the U.S. and China have deteriorated amid a trade war and mounting tensions over Chinese moves to curb political dissent in Hong Kong.The Chinese government has sought to stifle opposition following protests there in 2019 against a proposed law allowing extraditions to mainland China. That has led to concern that the former British colony is losing the freedoms it was promised when it was handed over to Chinese control in 1997.“Given the politically motivated arrests and trials, the silencing of the media, and the diminishing the space for elections and democratic opposition, we will continue to take steps in support of people in Hong Kong,” the White House said.It wasn’t immediately clear how many people would be eligible for the deferral, which the Department of Homeland Security said would allow Hong Kong residents to work while they are in the U.S."
politics,"As expected, the latest eviction moratorium from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is under legal attack, as real estate groups asked a federal judge Wednesday to halt protections for vulnerable renters."
politics,"Only a day after the CDC instated another, more targeted, eviction moratorium following the expiration of an earlier one, the Alabama and Georgia chapters of the National Association of Realtors filed a motion in federal court to stop the ban, claiming the order is out of the agency’s bounds."
politics,"The real estate groups say the CDC caved to “political pressure” when instituting this latest ban, alluding to the public push from House Democrats for the administration to extend the previous moratorium."
politics,"The United States has been under a blanket national eviction moratorium since last September — an order from the CDC that finally expired last Saturday. For days, White House and administration officials argued that they had “no legal authority” to extend the moratorium again, calling on Congress to do it instead."
politics,"Unsurprisingly, these eviction moratoriums have not been popular with real estate groups and related industry lobbies, who have called the government’s action unlawful. Landlords have lost billions in unpaid rent, as millions of renters who lost income and jobs during the pandemic have been unable to keep up with their bills."
politics,"The House failed to do so, attempting to pass a vote by unanimous consent that was blocked by Republicans — a result that prompted outrage among progressive lawmakers. A group of House Democrats, led by Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), slept on the steps of the U.S. Capitol in protest of the last eviction moratorium expiring. Meanwhile, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) urged the White House, both publicly and privately, to extend the moratorium."
politics,"“We have argued all along that the best solution for all parties is rental assistance for tenants in need paid directly to housing providers,” Shannon McGahn, chief advocacy officer for NAR, said in a statement. “Nearly half of all rental housing in America is a mom-and-pop operation, and these providers cannot continue to live in a state of financial hardship.”"
politics,"Finally on Tuesday, the CDC instated a more targeted moratorium ― not a blanket national ban on evictions, but one that only applies to counties with high rates of COVID-19. Still, because rates of transmission are so high, the moratorium will likely apply to 90% of renters, the White House said."
politics,"The Georgia and Alabama real estate groups filed a lawsuit against the last ban as well — a case that ultimately made it to the Supreme Court. In late June, the Supreme Court ruled that the national eviction moratorium could stay in place through July 31."
politics,"Compounding the issue is that states and cities have been extremely slow at getting out rental assistance — in the form of a $45 billion fund that Congress approved in the last two COVID-19 relief bills — that could go a long way toward making landlords whole, as they are also eligible to request funds. As of June, only $3 billion of the fund had been dispersed."
politics,"But Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who in June voted in favor of keeping the ban in place at the time, cast doubt on the legality of any further extensions to the moratorium. Kavanaugh wrote in his concurring opinion that after July 31, eviction moratoriums would need congressional approval."
politics,"That said, even President Joe Biden has suggested the CDC’s new eviction moratorium may not pass constitutional muster. On Tuesday, he said the White House had consulted with legal scholars, many of whom said the new order would likely be thrown out."
politics,"The CDC is arguing that circumstances have changed in the past month as the delta variant of the coronavirus spreads rapidly through the country, with high levels of transmission in the majority of states. "
politics,"Biden also misleadingly said that the Supreme Court had ruled the last moratorium “unconstitutional.” It did not do that, but Kavanaugh’s opinion did give a window into the challenging legal environment the CDC will be facing this time around."
politics,"“At a minimum, by the time it is litigated, it will probably give some additional time while we are getting that $45 billion out to people who are in fact behind on their rent and don’t have the money,” Biden said Tuesday."

politics,MSNBC’s Ari Melber set the moment to the Megan Thee Stallion and Beyoncé song “Savage.”
politics,"The decision could come by Friday, and will require a presidential waiver to allow the vaccine to be administered to troops before it has full approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Vaccines are currently being used under the agency’s emergency use authorization mandate, although at least one vaccine — the Pfizer/BioNTech shot — is expected to get full approval by early next month."
politics,CNN reported that Austin’s “inclination” is to make the vaccines mandatory.
politics,"The move follows President Joe Biden’s decision last week to mandate vaccination for all federal employees and on-site contractors or require those who do not get the shot to be tested weekly. Biden’s directive extends to about 766,000 civilians working for the Pentagon, but not active-duty service members, The New York Times noted. The president had directed Austin to look into how the Defense Department could mandate the vaccine."
politics,"Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is expected to make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory for all active-duty troops in the coming days, a far-reaching decision that reflects the government’s ongoing concern over the spread of the delta variant, multiple outlets reported Wednesday."
politics,"“There’s nothing political about it,” Biden said."
politics,"The president, echoing public health experts, said at the time that vaccines remained the best method to prevent severe cases of COVID-19, as well as death associated with the disease."
politics,"The Defense Department had previously said it would likely wait for full FDA approval of the vaccines before making them mandatory, but a renewed surge in coronavirus cases has expedited that timeline."
politics,"COVID-19 infections are rising in every state in the nation due to the highly transmissible delta variant, threatening the reopening of businesses and the return to schools and offices, and forcing some states to reinstitute pandemic guidelines like mask mandates. Many universities and local governments have begun to mandate vaccination for students and employees, and pediatrics groups have expressed alarm about plans for children to get back to in-person school in the fall."

politics,"Biden plans to tap Beth Robinson for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Robinson, who has been an associate judge on the Vermont Supreme Court since 2011, would be the first openly LGBTQ woman to ever serve on any U.S. appeals court if confirmed. "
politics,"With Thursday’s news, Biden has put forward a total of 35 judicial nominees. His team has been moving quickly to fill vacant court seats, in part to try to counter the effect that former President Donald Trump had on the courts with his massive number of conservative, ideological judges. Biden’s first judicial nominations came sooner in his presidency than any of his recent predecessors, and he’s been getting his judges confirmed faster than decades of past presidents. "
politics,"Biden’s nominees are far more diverse, both professionally and demographically, than Trump’s were. While most of Trump’s court picks were white, male corporate lawyers, Biden’s nominees include public defenders, civil rights lawyers, voting rights lawyers and historic firsts with Native American and Muslim American picks."

politics,Twitter users had thoughts:
politics,Donald Trump is offering his supporters the chance to prove their devotion to him by carrying cards in honor of the twice-impeached former president.
politics,"That belief is wrong. The virus has already killed more than 600,000 Americans. And it’s killing more every day. "
politics,"More than half of unvaccinated Americans think COVID-19 shots are more dangerous than the virus, according to a new poll out Wednesday."
politics,"But the new fatalities are almost exclusively among the unvaccinated, offering vivid proof that the shots work and that they are safe, just as officials and scientists have been saying all along."
politics,"Even so, a significant portion of Americans remain wary. Wednesday’s polling report helps explain why, especially when it comes to those who seem dead-set against getting the vaccine."
politics,"The report comes from the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation’s Vaccine Monitor project, which has been tracking public perceptions and experiences with the vaccine since December, when the first shots became available. And there’s certainly been a lot of progress since then."
politics,"As of July 27, when Kaiser researchers finished their latest round of questions, 67% of adults said they had gotten vaccinated or would get the shots as soon as they could. That’s consistent with official statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which this week reported that 70% of adults had gotten at least one shot."
politics,"One reason the vaccination number keeps going up is that the ranks of Americans who describe themselves as undecided ― the ones who say they will “wait and see” how the shots perform ― has shrunk dramatically, from 39% in December to just 10% now. "
politics,"Maybe it’s seeing friends and families get the shots, with only sporadic or mild side effects. Maybe it’s hearing about vaccine safety and efficacy from people they trust. Maybe it’s fear of the delta variant, which spreads more easily than its predecessors."
politics,It was 15% in December. It’s 14% now. 
politics,But the number of Americans who say they will “definitely not” get the vaccine basically hasn’t budged.
politics,"Whatever the reason, many of these people are finally deciding to get the shots."
politics,"Behind that determination are a set of convictions at odds with reality. Nine in 10 say are not worried they will get seriously ill, according to the Kaiser poll, and three-quarters believe the shots are more hazardous than the disease."
politics,"This is the same group that gets information predominantly from right-wing media sources ― some on television, some on social media ― that have questioned the severity of the pandemic and, at times, the usefulness of the vaccine. "
politics,"As to why this group holds these beliefs, their demographics offer some clues: 65% are white adults and 58% describe themselves as Republican or Republican-leaning. "
politics,"It’s a different story with the “wait and see” group, who are less likely to be Republicans and more likely to be people of color ― and who represent the population most likely to respond to ongoing outreach and education efforts."
politics,"“There are really two groups of unvaccinated Americans,” Ashley Kirzinger, associate director for the foundation’s public opinion research group, told HuffPost."
politics,"The “wait and see” group includes plenty of white Republicans, just as the “definitely not” group includes some Democrats and people of color. Some people are reluctant to get the vaccines because they think, wrongly, it will cost them money ― or because they’re afraid of losing time at work."
politics,"Of course, there’s still a lot of diversity within the groups, as Kirzinger noted."
politics,"And just in the past week, after the Kaiser pollsters ended this month’s fieldwork, the nationwide vaccine rate has started to pick up again. The acceleration has been especially notable in parts of the country now seeing case spikes, which correspond closely to areas with low vaccination rates."
politics,"In other words, people in the “wait and see” category may have decided there’s no point in waiting any longer, because they have seen enough."
politics,"Some might be responding to new vaccine requirements that governments, employers, health systems and universities are putting in place. Others may be changing their minds because of the increased suffering among their neighbors and in their communities."
politics,"Either way, it’s progress of a sort ― and something to watch for in next month’s poll."

politics,"A judge sentenced an incarcerated supporter of former President Donald Trump to time served under a plea deal in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol attack on Wednesday, telling the Michigan man that he had “placed his trust in someone who repaid that trust by lying to him.”"
politics,"U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson told Capitol attack defendant Karl Dresch that he was “not a political prisoner” and was in jail because of his actions on Jan. 6. Under a plea deal, Dresch pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count and was sentenced to time served. Dresch faced several counts ― including a felony charge of obstruction of an official proceeding ― that will be dropped as part of the plea deal. He’ll be released from jail Wednesday."
politics,"Dresch, who called Jan. 6 the “best day ever,” made his first appearance in federal court on Jan. 20, the day of President Joe Biden’s inauguration. He’s already served more time behind bars than the six-month maximum sentence he could face under a misdemeanor offense."
politics,Jackson noted that Dresch’s belief in a stolen election was “misguided” and that courts have universally rejected the bizarre conspiracy theories that Trump and his allies attempted to present to soothe the former president’s feelings about his 2020 loss.
politics,"Dresch was arrested because he was an “enthusiastic participant in an effort to subvert and undo the electoral process” who came to D.C. and encouraged others to do the same, Jackson said."
politics,"“The defendant did not spend six months in jail because of his political views. He was not a political prisoner. He was not prosecuted for exercising his First Amendment rights,” Jackson said. “He just pled guilty to a federal offense, he just admitted that he broke the law.”"
politics,"“At the end of the day, the fact is that the defendant came to the Capitol because he placed his trust in someone who repaid that trust by lying to him,” Jackson said."
politics,"“We’re not here today because he supported the former president,” Jackson said. "
politics,"The FBI has made more than 550 arrests in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, and hundreds more arrests are in the works. Last month, the first Capitol defendant to plead guilty to a felony was sentenced to eight months behind bars. Two more Capitol defendants have sentences scheduled for Wednesday, and another Capitol defendant plans to enter a guilty plea this afternoon."
politics,"“Mike Pence gave our country to the communist hordes, traitor scum like the rest of them, we have your back give the word and we will be back even stronger,” Dresch wrote."
politics,"Dresch was one of many Jan. 6 defendants who pushed back on their fellow Trump supporters’ conspiracy theories that suggested that left-wing protesters were actually responsible for the violence and destruction at the Capitol. He referred to Jan. 6 as “1776,” called himself and other Trump supporters patriots, and called his political opponents who did not believe in internet conspiracies about a stolen election “traitors.” He wrote in one post that Trump supporters “had the cops booking it” on Jan. 6, and continued to support the mob’s actions after the attack."
politics,"Jackson called Dresch “a big talker” but said that his actions “did not match his rhetoric.” She also said Dresch had misguided views about what patriotism was all about, and that he didn’t get to cancel out other Americans’ votes and call for war because he didn’t like the outcome of the election."
politics,"“That’s not patriotism. Patriotism is loyalty to country, loyalty to the constitution, not loyalty to a single head of state,” Jackson said. “That’s the tyranny we rejected on July 4, 1776. This event did not honor our nation’s founders. It didn’t honor anyone.”"

politics,The whiskey matter came to light in the State Department’s annual accounting of gifts given to senior U.S. officials by foreign governments and leaders.
politics,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department said Wednesday it’s looking into the apparent disappearance of a nearly $6,000 bottle of whiskey given more than two years ago to then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo by the government of Japan."
politics,"In a notice filed in the Federal Register, the department said it could find no trace of the bottle’s whereabouts and that there is an “ongoing inquiry” into what happened to the booze. The department reported the investigation in its annual accounting of gifts given to senior U.S. officials by foreign governments and leaders."
politics,"The filing said Trump and his wife, Melania, received more than $120,000 worth of presents from foreign leaders in 2019, compared with $88,200 the year before. In Trump’s first year in office, in 2017, they reported receiving more than $140,000 in gifts."
politics,"“The department is looking into the matter and has an ongoing inquiry,” it said in the Federal Register notice. The notice offered no additional detail. A spokesman for Pompeo could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday."

politics,"There was no significant common theme to the 2019 gifts. At least three foreign leaders — from Australia, Egypt and Vietnam — presented Trump with photographs or portraits of himself that collectively were valued at more than $10,000."
politics,"Pompeo also reported receiving two carpets worth a total of $19,400 from the president of Kazakhstan and the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates. Both floor coverings were transferred to the General Services Administration, the notice said."

politics,"“It’s a big worry,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who uses crowdsourced methods to help raise funds for Democratic candidates across the country, said of the race."
politics,"“The psychological and social pressures of what happened during the Trump administration are not just bureaucratic, legal effects. They are effects on people’s bodies and people’s psyches and people’s minds and people’s sense of well-being,” said Gregg Gonsalves, an associate professor at the Yale School of Public Health and an author of the study."
politics,"Researchers analyzed more than 250,000 adult patients living in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area between January 2016 and December 2017 and compared their primary care and emergency department visits one year before to one year after the ban was issued. Researchers sorted patient data into three groups: adults born in a country listed in the travel ban countries, adults born in Muslim-majority countries not listed in the banned countries, and American-born, non-Latinx adults. "
politics,"Although primary care visits for stress-related diagnoses were up for all Muslim American patients before the ban in January 2017, researchers found that after the ban was enacted, Muslim American patients from the banned countries increasingly visited the emergency department."
politics,"Trump’s ban, which was later revised, upheld and expanded in court, separated families and individuals from impacted countries, prevented them from seeking medical care and caused people to miss out on work and educational opportunities, funerals and birthdays. Women in the U.S. who were from countries listed on the travel ban list were more likely to deliver babies prematurely."
politics,"“Trump took a policy, used it as a weapon against a community in the United States, and it had direct effects of separating families and throwing misery among many people of Muslim American origin,” said Gonsalves. “The effects of policies don’t necessarily play out in the realm in which they were devised; they often can have downstream effects that have pretty serious consequences for health.”"
politics,"National Democrats are growing increasingly anxious about the effort to oust California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), urging voters in the deep blue state to get engaged ahead of the Sept. 14 recall election or risk a Republican taking office."
politics,"While President Joe Biden rescinded the travel ban on his first day in office and has allowed for certain individuals to reapply for visas, the impacts of the ban remain. Previous visa lottery winners who were qualified to enter the U.S. but were barred from entering the country in time lost their once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to migrate to the U.S."
politics,"Several polls in recent days have shown recall supporters within striking distance of ousting the first-term governor, at least among voters who are considered most likely to cast a ballot. According to a survey conducted last week by the Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, Newsom would defeat the recall by a narrow 3-point margin, with 50% of the most likely voters saying they would retain the governor versus 47% saying they would replace him."
politics,"The study found lingering health effects on Muslim, refugee and immigrant communities residing in the U.S., including increased emergency room visits,missed primary care appointments, and more stress-related diagnoses."
politics,"In order to oust Newsom, recall supporters must win 51% of the vote on Election Day, making voter participation critical to both campaigns. The question of who should replace the governor would be determined by a separate question on the ballot."
politics,"But Newsom has several structural advantages in the race. For one, there are simply many more registered Democrats in the state ― nearly three times as many as there are Republicans. Even if some Democratic voters stay on the sidelines and every Republican casts a ballot in favor of the recall, Newsom is still likely to pull it out."
politics,"What’s making Democrats nervous is that the recall is taking place in an off-year election, something that could dampen voter participation in a state where most people already aren’t very engaged in politics. Newsom’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially with regard to business and school closures, has given his opponents fodder for attacks, as has his handling of rising crime and homelessness in the state."
politics,"This time around, the list includes notable Republicans like former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, who isn’t well known in the state, and athlete-turned-reality star Caitlyn Jenner, whose curious campaign strategy has included forgoing campaign events and taking a three-week trip to film a reality show in Australia. Talk radio host Larry Elder, the latest Republican to jump into the race, is currently leading the field of challengers, with 23% of voters expressing support for him."
politics,"“The math doesn’t work,” California Democratic strategist Garry South said of the recall effort. “I think he beats the recall, relatively handily, at the end of the day.”"
politics,"Newsom’s job approval numbers have bounced back to a comparatively normal level after taking a dip earlier this year ― they’re nowhere close to the dismal numbers (near 20%) that former California Gov. Gray Davis (D) saw on the eve of his own 2003 recall election. Newsom has also raised tens of millions of dollars, money he’ll presumably use to blanket the airwaves with advertisements in the coming weeks to make sure voters know about the recall. Pro-recall committees, meanwhile, have only raised $6 million so far."
politics,"Another poll conducted this week by Emerson College found the race to be in a statistical tie, with support for recall at 46% and opposition at 48%."
politics,"“He’s a good man and he’s a good public servant,” Feinstein said of Newsom. “And he doesn’t deserve this.”"
politics,"One of the biggest differences between the 2003 recall and this year’s effort is who is and isn’t running as a candidate. More than 40 people have qualified to run so far, but none have the star power that catapulted Arnold Schwarzenegger to the office after voters recalled Davis in 2003."
politics,"Sen. Alex Padilla (D), the state’s junior senator whom Newsom appointed to replace former senator and now-Vice President Kamala Harris, said voters face a “clear choice” on the ballot in September."
politics,"Still, California Democrats aren’t taking the race for granted. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the state’s senior senator who once faced a recall effort herself when she served as the mayor of San Francisco, said her constituents “really should be” paying attention."
politics,"The prevalence of vote-by-mail in California also gives Newsom’s chances a major boost. Every eligible voter in the state will receive a ballot in the mail, as they did for the first time during the 2020 presidential election. That makes the task of “turning out” voters easier."
politics,"“To continue in the direction we’re going, to address climate, expand health care, and protect working families ― or go backward on all the issues that we care about,” Padilla said."
politics,"In fact, a Republican governor of California wouldn’t simply mean a shift in the state’s politics ― it could affect the entire country."
politics,"Moreover, no credible Democrat has jumped into the race. In 2003, when then-Democratic Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante decided to run as a candidate, Davis had trouble tagging the recall effort as a partisan attempt to oust him. Newsom hasn’t had any trouble depicting this year’s recall effort as a GOP escapade."
politics,"The GOP could potentially get a chance to fill a Democratic Senate seat if the 88-year-old Feinstein retires early or is unable to serve out the rest of her term. Because Democrats narrowly control the 50-50 Senate at the moment, any change would give Republicans back the majority."
politics,"Emmer held a town hall for his constituents on July 28. During that call, a woman asked him whether he would support “patriots that rallied in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6.”"
politics,"Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), the man in charge of taking back the House majority for Republicans, is not ruling out supporting candidates who were part of the mob at the Capitol on Jan. 6. "
politics,But Emmer offered no condemnation of the mob of Donald Trump supporters that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6 to try to stop Congress from certifying the presidential election results in favor of Joe Biden. He also never ruled out supporting candidates who were there that day. From the exchange: 
politics,"Since the town hall was done in his official capacity as a member of Congress, Emmer could not use the call to conduct political business in his role as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, as he told the caller. "
politics,Emmer is not one of the 147 Republicans who objected to certifying Biden as the winner of the election.

politics,"“Chairman Emmer has made it clear ― and still believes ― anyone who broke the law needs to be held accountable,” NRCC Communications Director Michael McAdams said, adding, “Unlike Democrats, we believe the voters will ultimately make these decisions not dictators in Washington.”"
politics,"“House Republicans spread the Big Lie that the election was stolen, and now they’re doubling down by encouraging extreme candidates who attended the deadly insurrection to run for office,” said Elena Kuhn, spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “It’s abhorrent that Tom Emmer and House Republicans are siding with far right extremists who participated in a violent attack on our democracy which resulted in the death and injury of dozens of police officers.”"
politics,"There are at least two Republicans running for Congress who went to the Capitol on Jan. 6. Derrick Van Orden, who’s hoping to unseat Democratic Rep. Ron Kind in Wisconsin’s 3rd District, used leftover campaign funds from his 2020 run against Kind to travel to Washington for Trump’s “stop the steal” rally. Van Orden claimed that he never stepped foot on Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, but a photo from that day shows otherwise. "
politics,"In an opinion piece published on Jan. 13, Van Orden said he left the area when the “protest had become a mob,” fearing that by staying, it “could be construed as tacitly approving this unlawful conduct.”"
politics,"Van Orden has the backing of powerful House Republicans, including Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), Whip Steve Scalise (La.) and Conference Chair Elise Stefanik (N.Y.). "
politics,"If Daniels shot the video, he would have been well past the police barricades that the mob barreled through."
politics,"Republican Teddy Daniels, who is taking a shot at challenging Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Pa.), was also at the Capitol on Jan. 6 and put up a video showing the crowd. "
politics,"Daniels also ran in the 8th District in 2020, coming in second in the six-person GOP primary. "
politics,"But the couple, who got engaged in 2019, has only been able to be together three times during the pandemic. Travel restrictions mean Harrison must drive four hours from her Windsor, Ontario home to the Toronto airport in order to fly to Detroit where Sweat lives. For Sweat, it means a mandated two-week stay in Canada."
politics,"The two even drove to the outer limits of their respective borders just to see each other but they were still so far away that they “looked like dots,” Sweat said."

politics,"NEW YORK (AP) — Quintin Sweat and Renée Harrison live only 15 minutes apart by car, with the U.S.-Canada border between them."
politics,"Since the start of the pandemic, a constantly changing and confusing web of travel restrictions have separated loved ones around the world. For people whose lives cross international borders and for immigrants who leave their homes behind to move to a new country, not knowing when they can see their relatives again compounds the pain of separation."
politics,"For Sweat and Harrison, there is some relief in sight when Canada begins letting in fully vaccinated Americans on Aug. 9. Harrison still can’t drive in to Detroit, however, as the U.S. is restricting entry by car from Canada and Mexico until at least Aug. 21."
politics,"The U.S. still bars travelers from specific countries — Brazil, China, India, Iran, South Africa and much of Europe. The European Union recommended allowing in U.S. travelers in June, although individual European countries make their own rules. Britain opened its borders to fully vaccinated travelers from the U.S. and the European Union on Monday."
politics,"The U.S. airline lobby is pushing the U.S. government to reopen travel with “low-risk countries,” and European officials have pressed their case as well. But a White House official said July 26 that the U.S. will keep existing international travel restrictions in place for now because of surging infection rates due to the delta variant."

politics,"There is a debate among public health experts about how and when to restrict travel during a pandemic, said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Johns Hopkins University public health researcher. It’s been difficult to control COVID-19 even with travel bans in place, she said."
politics,"“I don’t yet see compelling data saying yes, travel restrictions worked, except for maybe a few examples,” such as New Zealand, she said."
politics,"Some travel restrictions may be circumvented by some people with the extra time and money to do so. Michelle Lariviere, who lives in a village about 45 minutes from London, flew to Croatia at the end of July, staying in a hotel there for two weeks, and then going to New York, because Croatia isn’t on the U.S.’s list of restricted countries while the U.K. is."
politics,"“I have to listen to my daughter crying on the phone wanting me to get there,” she said."
politics,"For some U.S. visa holders who have long been frustrated with having a life in limbo, the pandemic made a bad situation worse. Raj Karnatak, a doctor in Milwaukee, has for years been on a decades-long backlog for a green card. Now he can’t see his parents, who are in their 70s and live in India. There was a death in the family, and he and his wife couldn’t go to mourn with their relatives."
politics,"She says what she’s doing is nonsensical, but she’s desperate to see her daughter and grandchildren. She hasn’t seen them since September 2019, when they were 4 weeks old and 11 months old, and she had to take out a loan to pay for her trip."
politics,"“We are not machines, we are humans. We have families,” said Karnatak, who’s required to get a visa stamp at the U.S. consulate in India to reenter the U.S., and that’s not possible right now because consular services remain largely closed. “The travel restrictions are the biggest problem I have in my life.”"
politics,"Many countries around the world have barred flights from India because of the outbreak there and the spread of the delta variant, first found in India. India, meanwhile, has largely limited travel by foreigners since March 2020."
politics,"Even when travel is theoretically possible, restrictions can leave would-be travelers tangled in red tape. While Ronit Malinovitz’s parents were able to visit her in the Phoenix suburbs in the spring, she called off a trip to Israel this summer to see them and other relatives because of what she said was an overwhelming amount of paperwork involved in applying for Israeli passports for her two teenage daughters."

politics,"Last week, Hutchinson called on the state’s Republican-led legislature to return for a special session and overturn his decision to ban mask mandates in schools. The broader ban on state and local mask mandates would remain in place under the governor’s new proposal."
politics,Zeke Miller contributed from Washington.
politics,Legislators have expressed doubt that the ban can be lifted. 
politics,"“I signed it at the time because our cases were at a very low point,” Hutchinson said, referring to a law banning state or local mask mandates that he signed in April. “I knew it would be overwritten by the legislature if I didn’t sign it.”"
politics,"“So last summer, we said hopefully next year. Now, I’m telling you, hopefully next year, next summer. That’s what we keep telling ourselves,” Malinovitz said."

politics,"Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) on Tuesday expressed regret for signing a ban on mask mandates in schools, as his state is now enduring a troublesome spike in new coronavirus cases and hospitalizations. "
politics,"Both chambers in the Arkansas legislature would require a two-thirds vote to lift the ban on mask mandates in schools before classes begin later this month. With a simple majority, the ban wouldn’t be lifted for 90 days."
politics,"COVID-19 cases have surged in Arkansas due to the arrival of the highly contagious delta variant and the state’s poor vaccination rate. Just 36% of Arkansas’ 3 million residents are fully vaccinated, one of the lowest rates in the U.S."
politics,It would also create a pilot program in which commercial drivers license holders between 18 and 21 could enroll in long-haul apprenticeships. The program would require more than 200 hours of driving time accompanied by someone with at least two years of experience.
politics,"The provision for younger drivers is tucked into a big bipartisan infrastructure bill that senators are amending this week ahead of its likely passage. The bill would carve out more than $500 billion for better roads, bridges and broadband internet service across the country. "
politics,"The trucking industry has clamored for the lower age limit for years, citing a shortage of workers willing to drive interstate for the wages carriers want to pay. But the policy could compromise highway safety. The Congressional Research Service — essentially an in-house think tank for lawmakers — has reported that “studies consistently show that young commercial drivers, like young drivers overall, are much more likely to be involved in crashes than their older counterparts.”"
politics,"Zach Cahalan, director of the Truck Safety Coalition, said the lower age limit shows a callous disregard for safety."
politics,"“Truck crash fatalities have increased 48% since 2009 and allowing teen truckers on our streets and roads will further accelerate this already unacceptable death toll,” he said in a statement to HuffPost."
politics,"Fatal truck crashes increased during the last decade, but lawmakers are poised to lower the age limit for long-haul driving from 21 to 18. "
politics,"“They’re gonna be trained, number one,” Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) told HuffPost. “Number two, I can tell you unequivocally ― and I drive a semi ― there are young kids who have better reaction time than I do, that know how to do it a hell of a lot better than I do, and I’ve been driving a truck for 40 years.” "
politics,"More than 5,000 large trucks and buses were involved in fatal crashes in 2018, according to the most recent data from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, a 48% increase from 2009. Most truck crash deaths occur on weekdays, in rural areas or on interstate highways, and the vast majority of people killed aren’t the truck drivers themselves. "
politics,But the bipartisan senators behind the measure have come up with their own reasons for why younger drivers will actually be safer. 
politics,"Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) has drafted an amendment to strip the pilot program from the infrastructure bill, but it’s unclear if it will get a vote, especially considering the proposal’s strong bipartisan backing. "
politics,"The teen trucker provision is based on legislation from Tester and Sen. Todd Young (R-Ind.), with nearly 30 bipartisan cosponsors including Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kirsten Sinema (D-Ariz.). "
politics,"“To put an 18-year-old behind the wheel of a multi-ton truck that could do damage and endanger drivers and lots of passengers seems kind of overboard,” Blumenthal told HuffPost, adding that the measure is a “giveaway to the trucking industry.”"
politics,"Jeremy Kirkpatrick, a spokesman for the American Trucking Associations, an industry lobbying group, said Claybrook’s numbers came from a study published in 1991."
politics,"“We’d suggest Ms. Claybrook source data from this decade, or this century, at least,” Kirkpatrick said."
politics,"The teenage trucker apprenticeship program will terminate after three years. It allows only 3,000 apprentices at a time, but that could amount to up to 25,000 new drivers entering the workforce per year, given the amount of training needed."
politics,"The broader Senate bill is weak on highway safety in general, said Joan Claybrook, former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and current chair of Citizens for Reliable and Safe Highways, in a lengthy statement this week. She called it “shameful” that senators failed to include stricter language implementing requirements for automatic braking systems and technology that detects when babies are left in hot cars. She described the teenage trucker provision as “reckless” and said commercial drivers “between the ages of 19-20 are six times more likely to be involved in fatal crashes than all truck drivers.” "
politics,"Young said the apprentices will be safer than regular drivers because the bill requires more training and for their trucks to have automatic emergency braking and forward-facing cameras, and said that giving the freight industry more workers will also boost safety: “If you have a shallow pool of applicants, you may end up choosing less qualified drivers.”"
politics,"As for the more recent increase in truck fatalities, the industry has repeatedly pointed to a Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration report from 2013 that estimated commercial trucks are at fault in 30% of crashes. Kirkpatrick also suggested that the proliferation of smartphones in recent years may have made drivers more distracted."
politics,"But Steve Viscelli, a University of Pennsylvania sociologist and expert on trucking labor issues, said the five or six weeks of required training is basically what the industry already does when it trains new drivers, and called the program simply a favor to an industry that complains it can’t find workers because it underpays and overworks its employees."
politics,"“There’s nothing new about this apprenticeship program from what the system already looks like,” Viscelli said. “They’re just allowing people under 21.”"
politics,"Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said Wednesday schools should use federal money to host coronavirus vaccine clinics as students return to in-person classes this fall, saying only “adult actions” could prevent students from returning to class full-time."
politics,"In his speech, Cardona said school districts around the country should use more than $130 billion in federal aid included in the administration’s coronavirus relief package to encourage parents, teachers and students older than 12 to get the vaccines, including by hosting clinics."
politics,"“I know vaccines work,” Cardona said in a brief phone interview after delivering a speech at an elementary school in Baltimore on the administration’s plans to return children safely to school. “But I’ll leave decisions on whether or not to mandate something to the health experts.” "
politics,"Republicans have intermittently hammered Democratic President Joe Biden over school closures due to the pandemic, often arguing his administration is more concerned with placating teachers’ unions than helping students learn. The administration is counting on a smooth return to schools this fall to keep the nation’s economic recovery on track and fend off further GOP attacks. "
politics,"“I know it’s hard work, but we need every district, every superintendent, every leader in every community to take this on, so we can get more students and community members vaccinated and so we can defeat this virus,” Cardona said. "
politics,"“Schools should be open,” Cardona told HuffPost. “I would be very disappointed if adult actions interfere with students’ ability to learn in person.”"
politics,Cardona said holding school-based clinics would give trusted community members the chance to persuade vaccine skeptics to get the life-saving shot.
politics,"Cardona also said states should repeal laws barring local school districts and municipalities from mandating masks for students and teachers, arguing mask requirements might be necessary for a safe return to school as the coronavirus pandemic continues. He declined, however, to say whether states should require teachers to get vaccinated against the coronavirus."
politics,The vaccines have been shown to virtually eliminate the risk of death from the COVID-19 virus and to dramatically decrease the chances of getting or spreading the disease. Children under 12 are not eligible for any of the available vaccines. Roughly 70% of Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine.
politics,"“Of course,” Cardona said when asked about repealing the laws, adding that he discussed the issue with Hutchinson. “I consider that strong leadership in the face of a crisis, and the willingness and the ability to look at the data and make decisions to help students and communities thrive.”"
politics,"Still, Cardona said school districts should not shy away from requiring masks while the nation continues its march toward higher vaccination rates. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics have recommended all elementary and high school students wear masks in school this fall."
politics,"“We cannot let mask fatigue, pride, or politics get in the way of doingwhat is right for our students,” he said during his speech."
politics,"In his interview, Cardona praised Arkansas GOP Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who said on Tuesday he regretted signing a law earlier this year that barred localities and school districts from imposing mask requirements in schools. Hutchinson has called for a special session of the state legislature to repeal the law."
politics,"“When we say we want vaccine clinics set up in schools, it’s because people trust their school principal, they trust their school nurse, they have a relationship with those people,” he said. “And that’s how we allay those fears.”"
politics,"At least eight states, all with Republican governors, have passed laws banning mask mandates. Cardona said other governors should follow Hutchinson’s lead and push for the repeal of those laws."
politics,"Mike Carey, a coal industry lobbyist endorsed by former President Donald Trump, defeated 10 opponents in the special Republican primary for Ohio’s 15th Congressional District."
politics,"Tuesday’s result “might signal that, within Ohio, Trump has a certain amount of support that can be leveraged in the governor’s race, the Senate race and other congressional races,” said Kevin Spiker, a political scientist at Ohio University."
politics,The outcome reaffirms Trump’s influence just a week after another candidate Trump backed lost a Republican congressional primary in Texas’ 6th Congressional District.
politics,Carey’s victory in the heavily Republican district makes him the overwhelming favorite in a special general election in November.
politics,"The vast rural district, which encompasses some of Columbus’s suburbs, opened up when then-Rep. Steve Stivers (R-Ohio) announced in April that he would be leaving Congress to head the Ohio Chamber of Commerce."
politics,"Carey dispatched with at least four serious candidates: state Sen. Bob Peterson (a farmer endorsed by Ohio Right to Life), state Rep. Jeff LaRe (a suburbanite backed by Stivers), state Sen. Stephanie Kunze, and ultra-right-wing former state Rep. Ron Hood, who was backed by Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.)."
politics,"Trump’s super PAC, Make America Great Again Action, spent over $400,000 boosting Carey. Trump also touted his endorsement of Carey at a late June rally in another part of the state."
politics,"Carey has featured the footage of Trump praising him in a TV ad. “He’s a wonderful man ― I’ve known him for a long time,” the ad showed Trump saying."
politics,"The Club for Growth, a hardline economic libertarian Republican group that has grown increasingly aligned with the Trump wing of the party in recent years, jumped into the race in a way that benefited Trump’s candidate of choice. The conservative group spent more than $300,000 attacking LaRe, Peterson and Kunze for being insufficiently conservative."
politics,"Amid chants of “Recess can wait, democracy can’t,” nearly 150 state lawmakers from 30 states came to Washington on Tuesday to rally with Democratic U.S. senators and representatives and call on the Senate to suspend its August recess to pass voting rights and anti-gerrymandering legislation."
politics,These lawmakers arrived as reinforcements for the 50 Texas Democratic state legislators who fled their state 23 days ago in order to deny state House Republicans a quorum. The GOP lawmakers were trying to pass an election law that would make it harder for predominantly Democratic voting constituencies to vote and easier for Republican officials to overturn the results of elections they don’t like.
politics,"“When we arrived here, we said that our job was to rally the nation and bring people to Washington, D.C., because just by chance we would not only get the Senate to hear us, we would get them to act,” said Texas state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer, a Democrat."
politics,"State lawmakers, like those Texas Democrats who fled their state, have since become the faces of the campaign to pressure the Senate to pass the For The People Act, a package of voting rights, campaign finance, ethics and redistricting reforms that the House passed in May and that Senate Republicans filibustered in June. "
politics,"“This is the delta variant of Jim Crow voting laws and the only vaccination is federal legislation,” Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) said at the rally."
politics,"“We sent Senator Warnock and Senator Ossoff to give Democrats the majority to get the job done ― and not just for Georgians, not just for Democrats, but for all Americans,” said Georgia state Rep. Bee Nguyen, a Democrat who is running for secretary of state in Georgia in 2022. “Our democracy is in peril and we need federal protection now.”"
politics,The state lawmakers called on President Joe Biden to use the full power of his office to push the Senate to pass the legislation and for the Senate to change its filibuster rules to allow it to pass with a simple majority rather than the 60 votes it currently takes to begin and end debate on most legislation.
politics,"The U.S. Census Bureau is preparing to release its congressional redistricting data on Aug. 16. The For The People Act would require states to create independent and nonpartisan redistricting processes to draw new districts. Supporters of the bill believe that if it passes before Aug. 16, states would be prevented from unfairly manipulating voting districts ahead of the 2022 midterm elections."
politics,"“Now, I know some Democrats support keeping the filibuster because it moderates large swings in policy no matter who’s in charge, but in this very moment, the only thing it’s doing is impeding justice ― long-overdue justice for communities that have been targeted for systematic voter suppression,” said Georgia state Rep. Renitta Shannon, a Democrat."
politics,These lawmakers are directly facing down the ongoing threat created by former President Donald Trump’s lies about voter fraud that led to the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol and inspired hundreds of GOP voter suppression and election subversion bills that Democrats are fighting in committees and on the floors of their statehouses.
politics,"Every U.S. senator and representative who attended the rally on Tuesday joined the state lawmakers in calling to change the Senate’s filibuster rules. They included Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), Jeff Merkley (Ore.), Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.), Cory Booker (N.J.), Bob Casey (Penn.), Chris Van Hollen (Md.), Ben Ray Lujan (N.M.) and Warnock and Rep. John Sarbanes (Md.), the bill’s lead sponsor in the House."
politics,"Democratic Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.), a co-sponsor of the For The People Act, and Joe Manchin (W.Va.), who opposed the bill until days before it hit the Senate floor in June, remain the only Democratic senators who openly oppose changing the Senate’s filibuster rules. Others may agree with them, but none have said so publicly. To have any chance of passing the For The People Act, its supporters must convince these two Democrats to drop their objections to changing filibuster rules."
politics,"West Virginia state delegate Mike Pushkin demonstrated at the rally how West Virginians have been trying to convince Manchin to change his mind. That is, with a heaping dose of praise."
politics,"Pushkin praised Manchin for reaching a compromise agreement with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and the bill’s co-lead sponsors, Klobuchar and Merkley, to obtain his support for the bill. He praised Manchin for working on the amendment that will replace the current For The People Act, which has not yet been publicly released. And he called on everyone in attendance to praise Manchin, too."
politics,"“I’m confident that my senator and my friend Joe Manchin will seize this moment and break Mitch McConnell’s stranglehold on our democracy and get the job done before the Senate recess,” Pushkin said. “So, I urge everyone attending to call Senator Manchin’s office and thank him for offering this fair and reasonable proposal and let him know how much we appreciate him standing up for our democracy.”"
politics,"So far, Manchin has not budged from his opposition to changing the filibuster rules."
politics,"Biden has also refused to make any definitive statement on the filibuster as it relates to preventing the passage of voting rights laws. In a major speech at the Constitution Center in Philadelphia, he called the Republican push for voter suppression and election subversion legislation based on Trump’s lies “the most significant test of our democracy since the Civil War.” But he never once mentioned the filibuster, the only obstacle to passing legislation that would pass that test."
politics,The White House has instead reportedly suggested that voting and civil rights groups and politicians can “out-organize voter suppression.”
politics,"She added, however: “Let me be clear, we cannot out-organize the subversion of democracy. Let me be clear, we cannot out-organize power-hungry Republicans who are currently trying to steal power away from our local elections boards. We cannot out-organize partisan gerrymandering that allows politicians to pick their voters and not the other way around.”"
politics,"“We delivered for Biden,” Nguyen said at the rally. “We delivered those two U.S. Senate seats ― Senator Warnock and Senator Ossoff ― in spite of voter suppression. We organize because we know our voting rights are on the chopping block.”"
politics,Barack Obama’s massive birthday bash is off.
politics,"What was clear among all of the rally speakers and attendees was that the Republican effort to make it harder for communities of color to vote and easier to overturn unwanted election results in counties and jurisdictions with large Black, Latino and Native American populations is just the most recent entry in America’s history of racism."
politics,"“We needed federal intervention in 1865,” said Mississippi state Rep. Omeria Scott, a Democrat. “We needed federal intervention in Mississippi in 1965. And we need federal intervention in Mississippi and all over this country in 2021.”"
politics,"“He’s appreciative of others sending their birthday wishes from afar and looks forward to seeing people soon,” Hankins added."
politics,"But the shindig has now been “significantly” scaled back for only family and close friends “due to the new spread of the delta variant over the past week,” Obama’s spokesperson Hannah Hankins said in a statement Wednesday."

politics,"He’d drawn criticism for planning the now-nixed party ― for which guests had to be fully vaccinated and present negative test status ― amid the surge in coronavirus cases, fueled by unvaccinated people."
politics,"MAPLE HEIGHTS, Ohio ― Shontel Brown, a Cuyahoga County councilwoman, defeated Nina Turner in the special primary election for Ohio’s 11th Congressional District, all but ensuring that she will represent the Cleveland-area seat in Congress."
politics,"Brown’s victory is a major win for leaders of the moderate Democratic establishment, who backed her, and a stinging defeat for a progressive movement that counted Turner, a former Ohio state senator-turned-Bernie Sanders lieutenant, as one of its most beloved stars."
politics,"In an interview with HuffPost after her win, Brown attributed the outcome to “nine years of hard work that no one got a chance to see, cultivating quality relationships, delivering, responding to the needs of the community and being open and transparent while doing it.”"
politics,"Turner conceded the race on Tuesday night before all the results came in, but she was trailing Brown by a large enough margin that she and her team believed she did not have a path to victory."
politics,"In her remarks, Turner blamed the influx of outside money on Brown’s behalf for her defeat."
politics,"“We didn’t lose this race ― evil money manipulated and maligned this election,” she said."
politics,"“Tonight, my friends, we have looked across the promised land, but for this campaign, on this night, we will not cross the river,” Turner said to supporters at an election night party at a bowling alley just outside Cleveland. “Tonight our justice journey continues, and I am proud to continue that journey with each and every one of you.”"
politics,"When asked to respond to Turner’s comments, Brown simply reiterated a line she used on the trail and repeated during her victory speech."
politics,"“Results over rhetoric won out today. Public service over lip service won out,” Brown said. “That’s the bottom line and I’m grateful for the people recognizing the difference.” "
politics,"“People are tired of the negativity,” she added. “They want people who are focused on the issues.”"
politics,"Brown’s senior consultant, Daniel Barash of the Washington firm SKDK, was more blunt about Turner’s comments, noting that much of the outside money that drew Turner’s ire came from pro-Israel groups."
politics,"“I think you should be more careful when you talk about Jews and money,” he said."
politics,"Turner’s loss is the latest in a string of primary defeats for progressive candidates this year, following two election cycles in which left-wing challengers ousted five House incumbents."
politics,"“It is a victory for the more traditional side of the Democratic Party, which in Ohio is probably where most of the Democrats in the state are,” said Kevin Spiker, a political scientist at Ohio University."
politics,"The race’s outcome also affirms President Joe Biden’s status as a sacrosanct figure among a critical mass of Democratic voters. Brown promised cooperation with Biden, while Turner had a history of clashing with Biden and other top Democrats."
politics,"“Biden is viewed more positively among Democrats than [Donald] Trump is viewed among Republicans,” he added."
politics,Ohio’s 11th is a majority-Black and heavily Democratic seat that includes parts of Cleveland and Akron and their surrounding towns. 
politics,"Days before the election, Sean McElwee, co-founder of Data for Progress, a polling firm that consulted for a group backing Turner, said that if Turner lost, “It would suggest that a certain theory of left politics is incorrect and that a certain hyper anti-Democratic politics is not good.”"
politics,"The seat opened up when Biden appointed Marcia Fudge to serve as secretary of Housing and Urban Development. While Brown is due to face a Republican in November, the partisan balance in the district makes her the prohibitive favorite."
politics,"Brown, 46, is more ideologically moderate than Turner, 53. She has declined to embrace left-wing priorities like “Medicare for All” and the Green New Deal, and has not ruled out accepting corporate PAC contributions. Brown focused instead on the broad goals of reviving the region’s economy and combating gun violence."
politics,"But perhaps more important than Brown’s policy positions was her promise to adopt a less confrontational style than Turner, particularly vis-a-vis Democratic Party leadership."
politics,"She vowed to be a “partner” in Congress for the Biden-Harris administration, including Fudge, and “not be a thorn in their side.”"
politics,"The contrast with Turner, a frequent antagonist of the Democratic establishment, was clear. "
politics,"Turner had legislated as a mainstream Democrat during her early career as a Cleveland city councilwoman and state senator, shepherding an education reform deal opposed by the city’s teacher unions and teaming up with then-Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, to address police killings."
politics,But Turner’s decision to endorse Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ presidential bid in 2015 marked the beginning of an independent and sometimes controversial period in Turner’s career that would haunt her bid for Congress.
politics,"On the one hand, Turner developed national name recognition and stardom as a Sanders surrogate during the 2016 and 2020 presidential cycles."
politics,"At the same time, she took to combat with the Democratic Party with the zeal of a convert, going further than Sanders in her wariness of party leadership. In the 2016 general election, Turner publicly considered an invitation to join Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein’s ticket as a running mate. She has still not stated for whom she voted in that election."
politics,"In July 2020, Turner likened the choice between then-President Donald Trump and Biden to a choice between a “bowl of shit” and “half” of a bowl of shit. "
politics,"In a February interview with HuffPost, Turner called the remarks a “colorful comment made by me speaking to people’s pain.”"
politics,"Likening it to Vice President Kamala Harris’ reconciliation with Biden after suggesting he had opposed school integration during the first presidential debate, Turner added, “I would like to think people would judge me by my entire body of work and not just a colorful comment I made that they disagreed with.”"
politics,"Until the final two months of the campaign, Turner appeared to be getting her wish. She locked up the most prominent progressive endorsements and mobilized the Sanders-aligned network of progressive voters to raise more than $1 million in her first six weeks in the race. "
politics,"A massive cash advantage allowed Turner to air advertisements on broadcast television a month before Brown. She used those ads to shore up her mainstream Democratic credentials, touting her commitment to causes like gender pay equity and her work with Kasich."
politics,"“She reminded people that she had a deep well of political experience that went beyond being an organizer and a chair for the Bernie Sanders campaign,” said David Cohen, a professor of political science at the University of Akron."
politics,"The legislative experience that Turner amplified in her TV spots also helped her win key endorsements from outside the progressive firmament, including Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson, state Senate Democratic Leader Kenny Yuko and former Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper. The editorial board of the Plain Dealer, Cleveland’s flagship newspaper, not only endorsed Turner, but dismissed Brown as “pleasant but undistinguished.”"
politics,"The most important factor of all, however, was an influx of outside support from the pro-Israel super PAC Democratic Majority for Israel. At the end of June, the group initiated a $2-million TV, digital and field effort attacking Turner and bolstering Brown."
politics,Polling conducted by both campaigns at the end of May showed Turner ahead by more than 30 percentage points.
politics,"In her first broadcast TV spot, she and her mother discuss her work in county government and her support for Biden. “Shontel’s a Democrat’s Democrat ― proudly voted for Joe Biden,” Brown’s mother says while holding up a photo of Brown and Biden."
politics,"Next, Turner made the biggest mistake of her campaign. Speaking on a panel with rapper “Killer” Mike Render, Turner appeared to express agreement when Render said it was “incredibly stupid” for House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.) to have endorsed Biden without demanding more in exchange."
politics,"Clyburn, the highest-ranking Black member of Congress, endorsed Brown days later, claiming the “Killer Mike” incident had inspired his decision. Brown soon featured Clyburn’s endorsement in one of her TV ads. In the spot, Clyburn dubbed her the rightful heir to the “legacy” built by Fudge and her predecessors, former Reps. Lou Stokes and Stephanie Tubbs Jones."
politics,"A subsequent digital barrage of more than $500,000 from Third Way, a corporate-backed Democratic group, reinforced the message."
politics,"Another spot featured the endorsement of Fudge’s elderly mother, effectively giving Brown, a Fudge protégé, the HUD secretary’s blessing by proxy."
politics,"First, Turner’s campaign dramatically ratcheted down their TV advertising in June, going almost entirely dark in the first two weeks of the month. "
politics,That would end up being Turner’s high-water mark before a few key developments broke Brown’s way. 
politics,Brown staked a major chunk of her modest campaign chest on ad buys that introduced her to voters virtually uncontested on the airwaves.
politics,"In the end, plenty of mainstream Democratic voters stood by Turner, recalling her record of public service in Cleveland."
politics,"Critically, DMFI’s ads informed voters that Turner had declined to support Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. They also highlighted Turner’s “bowl of shit” comments, emblazoning the image of Turner as a disloyal Democrat in the public’s psyche."
politics,"“Clearly much of the establishment Democratic Party not located in Ohio viewed this race as an important one for them to get involved in,” Cohen said. “When that happened, Shontel Brown’s campaign fortunes turned around.”"
politics,"No one went further than Turner’s campaign, which blasted Brown for voting to approve a multimillion-dollar contract for a construction contractor with ties to her partner. "
politics,"The attacks on Turner are a “bunch of junk,” Taylor said."
politics,"But other voters that Turner needed to win abandoned her, indicating that the advertising campaign had resonated."
politics,"“The main thing is that she’s for the people,” said Margaret Taylor, a retired cashier voting in Cleveland’s Lee-Harvard neighborhood, where Turner also lives. “She’s a beautiful person.”"
politics,"A Turner ad in the final days of the race misleadingly claimed that Brown is already under investigation and that Brown “could face criminal charges and, if convicted, jail time.”"
politics,"Of course, Turner had given them ample material with which to work. “I don’t think there’s any question that the ‘bowl’ comments hurt Nina Turner,” Cohen said."
politics,"Pro-Turner super PACs tried to stanch the bleeding with ads of their own rebutting the attacks on Turner, and drawing attention to Brown’s support from some Republicans."
politics,"“I’m not a Nina Turner fan, with all the things she’s said and done about the Democratic Party, and things she’s said about Biden,” said Erskine Bevel, a nonprofit executive voting in the Cleveland suburb of Shaker Heights. “She doesn’t support the Democratic Party.”"
politics,"Jenkins, a resident of Lee-Harvard who knew Turner for much longer than Brown, had grown disillusioned with Turner’s left-wing turn in recent years."
politics,"For other voters, Turner’s more forceful speaking style drove them into Brown’s arms."
politics,“Bowl of crap?!” he added. “Come on!”
politics,"“Nina is portraying herself as an angry Black woman. And that’s how everybody sees Black women ― as angry,” said Monique Jenkins, who is Black."
politics,"Donald Trump Jr., son of the former president, griped about President Joe Biden on Twitter on Tuesday."
politics,"“She’s gone with the wind,” Jenkins said. “She’s not a Democrat any more. She’s not Republican. She’s whichever way the wind blows.”"
politics,But Don Jr.’s critics were quick to point out Trump’s frequent and well-documented struggles with words:
politics,Trump complained about Biden’s verbal slips when he reads from a teleprompter:
politics,"Charlotte Bennett, one of several women who has accused Andrew Cuomo (D) of sexual harassment, said Tuesday that the New York governor should face impeachment if he refuses to resign. "
politics,"Speaking with CBS News’ Norah O’Donnell, Bennett, a former aide of Cuomo’s, said “the governor broke federal and state law when he sexually harassed me and current and former staffers.”"
politics,Bennett added that Cuomo ― who has flatly denied the many allegations against him ― was “absolutely” gaslighting her by insisting that he’d only been showing concern towards her during encounters that had made her uncomfortable.
politics,"“He’s trying to justify himself by making me out to be someone who can’t tell the difference between sexual harassment and mentorship. I think that’s absolutely absurd,” Bennett told O’Donnell."
politics,"“If he’s not willing to step down, then we have a responsibility to act and impeach him,” she said."
politics,"“We have a report. We have the facts,” she continued, referring to the investigation conducted by New York Attorney General Letitia James which concluded that Cuomo had sexually harassed at least 11 women, including Bennett, since taking the helm as governor."
politics,"Cuomo, a Democrat, has served in the role since 2011."
politics,James said Tuesday that Cuomo had “sexually harassed current and former New York State employees by engaging in unwelcome and non-consensual touching and making numerous offensive comments of a suggestive and sexual nature that created a hostile work environment for women.”
politics,"Bennett, who was the governor’s executive assistant and health policy adviser, has said the governor made inappropriate comments to her on several occasions."
politics,"During one encounter in June 2020, she claimed he asked her whether her experience with sexual assault had negatively impacted her sex life. He allegedly also told her he was lonely and was comfortable with the idea of dating “anyone over 22.”"
politics,"Cuomo, 63, has refuted Bennett’s claims and the findings in James’ report, saying “the facts are much different than what has been portrayed” and that he “never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances.”"
politics,"During a Tuesday press conference, he addressed Bennett’s allegations directly and said he’d meant only to empathize with her during their conversation last June."
politics,"Bennett, he said, had “identified herself to me as a survivor of sexual assault.” "
politics,"“The truth is that her story resonated deeply with me,” Cuomo said. “I had heard the same story before with the same ugliness, the same injustice, the same damage. Not only had I heard the story before, I had lived the story before. My family member is a survivor of sexual assault in high school. I have watched her live and suffer with the trauma. I would do anything to make it go away for her, but it never really goes away.”"
politics,"In a tweet, Bennett responded to Cuomo’s comments, saying she does “not want an apology ― I want accountability and an end to victim-blaming.”"
politics,She then tagged New York State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D) and beseeched him to “do the right thing” and impeach Cuomo.
politics,"A right-wing New Jersey gym owner with a brother who was on Michelle Obama’s Secret Service detail will plead guilty in connection with the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, his attorney told HuffPost on Tuesday."
politics,"Scott Fairlamb ― a fitness instructor, former ultimate fighter, and son of a New Jersey state trooper ― will plead guilty to one count of obstruction and one count of assault, his attorney Harley Breite told HuffPost on Tuesday. Fairlamb had faced a 12-count superseding indictment, which included a felony civil disorder charge. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, the Justice Department component prosecuting the Jan. 6 cases, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Court records indicated on Tuesday that a plea agreement hearing was scheduled for Friday at 1 p.m. before Judge Royce C. Lamberth. "
politics,"Fairlamb has been held in custody for roughly six months since his arrest. Breite, Fairlamb’s attorney, noted that his client had suffered a heart attack behind bars, lost his business, that his wife was not going to be able to keep up with the mortgage on their home."
politics,"“He wishes to assume responsibility for the things that he did,” Breite told HuffPost. “He wants to make amends for them and move on with his life.”"
politics,"“Obviously the goal is to argue for as little time as possible,” Breite said. “And also basically to tell the story of Scott Fairlamb.”"
politics,"Breite said they are not reaching out to Fairlamb’s brother with regard to the case. “We don’t wish to involve his brother,” Breite said. "
politics,Breite said Jan. 6 was “an aberration” for Fairlamb and that he’ll be arguing for as low as a sentence as he can convince a judge (although he didn’t have a number in mind yet).
politics,"“He’ll get a chance to tell his whole story, and at the appropriate time he will,” Breite said. “And at the appropriate time, justice will be meted out.”"
politics,Biden had pointed out that fully a third of all new cases are now coming from just those two states. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have vocally opposed vaccination or mask-wearing mandates to control the new surge in cases.
politics,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Tuesday criticized the Republican governors of Florida and Texas for hindering public health measures to control a surging strain of the coronavirus, asking them “to get out of the way” if they are not willing to help."
politics,"“What are we doing? COVID-19 is a national challenge,” he said in prepared remarks on the delta variant of the virus that he delivered from the East Room of the White House. “If some governors aren’t willing to do the right thing to beat this pandemic, then they should allow businesses and universities who want to do the right thing to be able to do it. I say to these governors: ‘Please help. But if you are not going to help, at least get out of the way of the people who are trying to do the right thing.’”"
politics,"DeSantis has threatened to pull funding from school districts that require students to wear masks, for example, and previously sued the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over vaccine requirements for cruise ship passengers."
politics,"Asked during a question-and-answer session with reporters why he would not call DeSantis directly to share his message, Biden laughed and said that it was not necessary."
politics,"Mary Trump has changed her prediction about her uncle, Donald Trump, running for president again in 2024."
politics,"“He knows the message. He knows the message,” he said on his way out of the room."
politics,"Trump’s niece — one of his most vocal critics — has repeatedly cast doubt on the idea of a comeback campaign. But two things now point to a possible run, she told MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell on Tuesday."
politics,"“We had a whole discussion when I was down there,” he added, referring to his meeting with DeSantis in South Florida during Biden’s visit there last month following the collapse of a beachfront condominium."
politics,"Both Abbott and DeSantis are believed to be mulling campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, and the party’s voting base includes a sizable percentage who oppose the coronavirus vaccine or continue to believe that the disease is a “hoax,” as former president Donald Trump once called it."
politics,"“And I think that would have been the case, if not for two things,” she continued."
politics,"Trump said her uncle “still seems to be getting away with everything, right?”"
politics,"“I thought that (he wouldn’t run again) for a long time because he lost so badly to Joe Biden that I didn’t think that he’d ever want to put himself in a position of losing again,” said Mary Trump."
politics,"Second, the GOP “is trying to engineer a system in which the minority can come into power, because of all of these ... voter suppression bills that are being passed in every single state,” she said."
politics,"“So, If they are successful in … rigging the system even more in their favor and Donald gets the message that if he runs, he can’t lose … then I’m not so sure and that’s pretty depressing,” she added."
politics,"As Florida battles a surge in coronavirus cases and a record number of COVID-19 hospitalizations, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) is getting caught up in a food fight. "
politics,"In a news release, DeSantis said he wanted to deter “woke corporations” and send a message “that we will defend our strong relationship with the Jewish State.”"
politics,DeSantis is also fighting in court to prevent COVID-19 vaccine requirements on cruise ships.
politics,"On Tuesday, DeSantis added British brand conglomerate Unilever to the state’s list of “scrutinized companies” because one of its divisions, Ben & Jerry’s, announced last month that it would stop ice cream sales in Israeli-occupied West Bank and contested east Jerusalem. The move could ultimately prohibit Florida from having investments in Unilever or any contracts with the company and its subsidiaries if it doesn’t reverse course in 90 days."
politics,"On Tuesday, Florida reported 11,515 people hospitalized with the coronavirus, a pandemic record, including some 2,400 in ICUs, per the Orlando Sentinel. And experts do not see any relief in the immediate future. "
politics,"“Short term and long term, the cases are going to explode,” Edwin Michael, a professor of epidemiology at the University of South Florida in Tampa, told The New York Times. “We are predicting that the cases will be peaking the first week of September.”"
politics,"But as cases continue to climb, DeSantis has prioritized his culture war with Ben & Jerry’s."
politics,"“I will not stand idly by as woke corporate ideologues seek to boycott and divest from our ally, Israel,” DeSantis stated."
politics,"Michael said that without a slowdown in cases, the state might exceed hospital bed capacity by early next month. "
politics,"DeSantis has been far more passive when it comes to preventing the spread of the coronavirus. Last week, he signed an executive order to cut funding to school districts that require face coverings. As classes prepare to resume in the midst of the latest wave of the pandemic, both the CDC and the American Academy of Pediatrics have recommended universal masks indoors and in schools. "
entertainment,Bob Odenkirk gave fans an update on his health after he revealed last week that he had suffered a “small heart attack.”

entertainment,"Odenkirk gave his first public statement since suffering the heart attack in a Twitter post on Friday last week. He thanked his family, friends and fans for their “outpouring of love.” He also thanked the doctors who took care of him and noted that he was going to take “a beat to recover.”"
entertainment,"Prior to Odenkirk’s statement, representatives for the actor told The Hollywood Reporter that he was in stable condition after “experiencing a heart-related incident” while on set of AMC’s “Better Call Saul.” The show had been filming its sixth and final season."
entertainment,A number of Odenkirk’s “Breaking Bad” co-stars had taken to social media to share their well wishes to the actor after news broke that he collapsed on set on July 27.

entertainment,"On Friday, multiple outlets confirmed the game show — which production company Universal Television Alternative Studios had almost completed filming in California’s Simi Valley when the outbreak occurred — had been canceled."
entertainment,"The show, hosted by Bobby Moynihan and Ron Funches, had been slated to premiere on Sunday following the conclusion of the Tokyo Olympics."

entertainment,Rihanna had a candid response to a paparazzo who asked her what it meant to her to reach billionaire status.
entertainment,"In a video taken while the singer and Fenty Beauty mogul was shopping in New York City with her boyfriend, rapper A$AP Rocky, this week, a paparazzo can be heard saying: “Rih, self-made billionaire, what does that mean to you? What does that mean to you?”"

entertainment,"Foo Fighters had a hilarious response to protestors from the Westboro Baptist Church who were picketing their concert at Azura Amphitheater in Bonner Springs, Kansas, on Thursday."
entertainment,"As fans began arriving in the parking lot, the band hopped on a flatbed truck and serenaded the protestors to a sweet rendition of the Bee Gees’ “You Should Be Dancing.” "
entertainment,A fan’s video of the mini-concert went viral on Twitter Thursday.
entertainment,"“Ladies and gentlemen, I got something to say. Because you know what? I love you! I do,” Foo Fighters’ frontman Dave Grohl told the protesters as the music played. “The way I look at it, I love everybody. That’s what you’re supposed to do ... I deliver all of my love, and you shouldn’t be hating. You should be dancing!”"
entertainment,"It’s unclear why the hyper-conservative church known for its homophobic rhetoric targeted Foo Fighters specifically — but unlike other recent protests outside of the band’s concerts, it doesn’t appear to be related to COVID-19 vaccinations."
entertainment,"A press release published by the church about the protest said that “The Foo Fighters have made no attempt to make their bodies a living sacrifice, holy (meaning separated from the ways of this world), and acceptable unto God, being their reasonable service.”"
entertainment,"Although that reasoning could be applied to, say, almost any other band in the world, the church has been targeting Foo Fighters for years and protests the band’s shows whenever they’re in town."
entertainment,This is also not the first time the band has trolled the church’s rallies against them. They played Willie Watson’s “Keep It Clean” to members in 2011 and danced to Rick Astley’s “Never Gonna Give You Up” in front of a small group of picketers in 2015.
entertainment,Foo Fighters’ song choice on Thursday makes sense as well.
entertainment,"Being that Grohl is a disco fan, the band unveiled the band’s 1970s alter ego, the Dee Gees, and released a Bee Gees-inspired album called ”Hail Satin,” which covers many of the Gibb brothers’ biggest hits."
entertainment,"Quick, someone put Jake Gyllenhaal back in a bubble. "
entertainment,The “Brokeback Mountain” star joined a growing list of celebrities revealing that they aren’t stoked about soap on Thursday when he told Vanity Fair that he’s not really into bathing every day.
entertainment,"When asked by the magazine if there’s anything “revelatory” about his bathing rituals, the “Spider-Man: Far from Home” villain’s response was anything but mysterio."
entertainment,"“I always am baffled that loofahs come from nature. They feel like they’ve been made in a factory but, in fact, it’s just not true. Since I was young, it’s amazed me,” he said, before adding: “More and more I find bathing to be less necessary, at times. I do believe, because Elvis Costello is wonderful, that good manners and bad breath get you nowhere. So I do that. But I do also think that there’s a whole world of not bathing that is also really helpful for skin maintenance, and we naturally clean ourselves.”"
entertainment,Although there are many interesting tidbits in this loaded quote — like the 40-year-old actor’s apparent denial that synthetic loofahs exist — people on Twitter latched on to Gyllenhaal’s stance on sudsing up.
entertainment,The “Donnie Darko” star certainly isn’t alone in his opinion.
entertainment,"Mila Kunis and Ashton Kutcher recently revealed that they soap down only their essential areas every day, and just wash their kids when they see dirt on them. Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell also admitted they weren’t that bubbly about regularly bathing their children."
entertainment,"“[I’m a] big fan of waiting for the stink,” Bell said. “Once you catch a whiff, that’s biology’s way of letting you know you need to clean it up.”"
entertainment,"In recent years, it’s become more common to argue that using soap daily strips your body of essential natural oils."
entertainment,Some experts back up that claim.
entertainment,"“You can just rinse and just wash your bits. So we’re not saying don’t shower,” Sandy Skotnicki, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto’s Department of Medicine, told CTV News in 2019. “When you’re just sitting in an office all day, are you dirty? The answer is no.”"
entertainment,"Dr. Ben Barankin, the medical director at the Toronto Dermatology Centre, told HuffPost Canada in 2019 that 80% of germs and bacteria that cause odor “will be cleaned off just by water itself.”"
entertainment,"Barankin also said kids, before puberty, don’t need to be bathed regularly, and that people should look to their individual lifestyle to determine how often they should lather up."
entertainment,"“If you’re just sitting at home, or not running around all day and breaking a sweat, and not wearing tight or polyester clothing,” Barankin said, “then you can go days without showering, and that’s fine.”"

entertainment,The famed singer and actor also suggested how to tackle the twice-impeached former president’s 2020 election conspiracy theories.
entertainment,"Streisand, who has previously used her music to shade the ex-president, also called his time in office a “disaster” and “unforgivable.”"

entertainment,Catch the video for “Tequila Does” below.
entertainment,"The Grammy-winning country artist unveiled the video for the Telemitry remix of “Tequila Does,” a track from 2019’s “Wildcard,” on Tuesday. Much of the buzz around the clip has focused on Lambert’s husband, Brendan McLoughlin, who shows off his chiseled physique in a steamy cameo with his brothers, K.C. and Patrick."
entertainment,"But “Tequila Does,” which was directed by Reid Long, also features an appearance by the singer’s brother, Luke Lambert, and his husband, Marc. Together, the group enjoys an all-inclusive Nashville celebration, complete with frozen cocktails and rainbow floats. Given that country music is still seen as a conservative genre, it’s a refreshing surprise to see a married gay couple featured so prominently."
entertainment,"The singer has been an outspoken supporter of LGBTQ rights for years, and in 2019, she and Luke attended New York’s LGBTQ Pride Parade together. After she shared snapshots of the festivities on Instagram, however, her fans were divided, with some pledging to denounce her music from that point onward."
entertainment,"As for her relationship with Luke, she told GLAAD this week, “We have come a long way from him struggling and figuring that out to now being in this video with me. It’s been a really cool sibling bonding for us, and for our family.”"
entertainment,"“Being in a family where I am surrounded by LGBTQ people, it has me learning and figuring out how I can be a part of the change and still be the same person I have been as an artist for 20 years,” Miranda Lambert told GLAAD in a Thursday interview. “I don’t see why those worlds can’t mesh. I speak up about things I care about! If I can be a part of this change in any way ... I always want to do that.”"
entertainment,"Ryan Reynolds spoke out on behalf of his wife and close collaborator, Blake Lively, in the hopes that she finally gets the credit she deserves."
entertainment,"“I feel like the people who commented negatively weren’t my followers,” she later told PrideSource. “Also, I don’t understand why people have time to get on social media and be negative. I think they should get a hobby or a job, or both. ... But I also know that if you’re polarizing, you must have an impact. Can’t be loved by everybody. So I try to take the good and run with that.”"
entertainment,"“I write on a lot of my movies. It’s been a survival mechanism for me for a long time. Sometimes I’m credited, sometimes I’m not,” Reynolds said Thursday during an interview with SiriusXM’s Jess Cagle."
entertainment,"Reynolds, who has been married to the “Gossip Girl” star for nearly 10 years,revealed that his wife has written some of his best lines, though she’s never gotten real recognition due to Hollywood’s “inherent sexism.”"

entertainment,"“And you know, it’s funny. I don’t know. Maybe it’s ’cause there’s an inherent sexism in the business. I will say that a lot of times, ‘She wrote that ― Blake wrote that ― not me. ... That was her,’” the “Deadpool” star said."

entertainment,"“She’s helped me so much in ‘Deadpool,’ all kinds of movies that have been big successes,” Reynolds added."
entertainment,"The writer and producer also promoted a bit of his own writing during the interview, telling Cagle about a short he’d written as a sort-of Disney and “Deadpool” crossover that didn’t make the cut."
entertainment,Perhaps now Lively will get her due.
entertainment,"The actor, who was originally asked about “the best part about being married to Blake Lively that people wouldn’t expect,” couldn’t resist getting in a quip about his wife. He and Cagle joked that her baked goods were also a nice perk of the relationship."
entertainment,"“I know that Disney has a pretty storied history with short films,” Reynolds said, explaining that he wrote a short about “Deadpool interrogating the hunter who had killed Bambi’s mom.”"
entertainment,"“The rug-pull of it though, is that you think that Deadpool’s going to kill the hunter. Deadpool was actually just a huge fan,” the actor added. “He wants to know how he too can be as loathed as the hunter is in the Disney universe.”"
entertainment,Reynolds said Disney killed the idea “immediately” and that “there’s absolutely no way” that idea is happening.
entertainment,"“I didn’t even try to fight it,” the actor said."

entertainment,"The New York-born superstars, who share Italian American heritage, on Friday unveiled the music video for “I Get a Kick Out of You,” which appears on their forthcoming duets album, “Love for Sale.” The pair are in resplendent voice, and their take on the 1934 Cole Porter classic ― which first appeared in the stage musical “Anything Goes” ― is a slick, jazzy throwback."
entertainment,"Bennett’s wife, Susan Benedetto, told AARP The Magazine that her husband could still recognize family members and friends, but wasn’t always aware of where he was or what was happening around him."
entertainment,Watch “I Get a Kick Out of You” below.
entertainment,"Still, “I Get a Kick Out of You” feels bittersweet, and for good reason. In February, Bennett’s family confirmed that the 95-year-old musician has been living with Alzheimer’s disease for nearly five years. “Love for Sale,” which is slated for an Oct. 1 release, has been billed as his final album."
entertainment,"“There’s a lot about him that I miss,” she said. “Because he’s not the old Tony anymore. But when he sings, he’s the old Tony.”"
entertainment,"Bennett and Gaga successfully reunited for two in-person concerts at New York’s Radio City Music Hall this week. Titled “One Last Time: An Evening With Tony Bennett & Lady Gaga,” the performances received rave reviews and were reportedly filmed for a forthcoming television special."

entertainment,"Britney Spears’ father tried as recently as last month to prevent his daughter from spending her money the way she wanted to, according to a court document filed this week in a Los Angeles probate court."
entertainment,"A legal arrangement known as a conservatorship has been in place for 13 years that gives Spears’ father, James “Jamie” Spears, control over the singer’s finances. According to a document filed Thursday, Jamie Spears has wielded that power in myriad ways that hurt his 39-year-old daughter ― such as trying to prevent her from taking a brief trip to Hawaii."
entertainment,"The island vacation was to be taken several weeks after Britney’s first explosive and emotional remarks about her living situation, which she described as “abusive.” It required the singer to secure permission from her father, who disapproved “of the expenditure that would have come from his daughter’s own, hard-earned money.”"
entertainment,"Jamie Spears ultimately allowed Britney Spears to travel. But “the mere objection to his adult daughter taking a brief, well-earned vacation at this point in her life, while other funds are lavishly expended, underscores why suspension, and ultimately removal, should not wait,” Mathew Rosengart, the singer’s lawyer, argued."
entertainment,"At the very least, Rosengart said, the court should suspend Jamie Spears’ power until the hearing date, if it cannot be moved."
entertainment,"Rosengart was appealing to a court to move up Britney Spears’ next court date to Aug. 23, in hopes of removing her father from her conservatorship as soon as possible. The next hearing is currently scheduled for Sept. 29."
entertainment,"“These spendthrift ways are particularly problematic when contrasted with the stringent, ‘absolutely microscopic control’ Mr. Spears has exercised over his daughter, evidently since her childhood and continuing through today,” Rosengart argued."
entertainment,"The pop star’s filing stated that Jamie Spears was spending large sums of his daughter’s money without her consent. Jamie spent $1.4 million on his own attorneys’ fees between October 2020 and June 2021, and a “shocking and inexplicable” portion of that massive figure ― more than $500,000 ― was apparently billed as “Media Matters,” the filing read. The singer’s father had also more than doubled her manager’s pay after Britney announced she was going on hiatus in 2019."
entertainment,"“In short, although a two-month wait for a hearing on the Petition may not seem significant in the context of 13 years, Ms. Spears should not be forced to continue [to] feel traumatized, lose sleep, and suffer further,” the filing read. “Every day matters.”"
entertainment,"In a filing of his own on Friday, Jamie Spears rejected the idea of freezing his powers, claiming that Britney’s other conservator, Jodi Montgomery, had questioned the singer’s mental health as recently as last month."
entertainment,"Spears would like an accountant, Jason Rubin, to temporarily replace her father as a conservator of her estate, which is worth an estimated $60 million, while she works to dissolve the legal arrangement. Montgomery, who makes decisions about the singer’s person, declared under oath in a court document filed last month that Jamie’s removal from the legal arrangement was “critical” to Britney’s “emotional health and well-being.” "
entertainment,"“So let me get this straight: Russia is allowed to compete in the Olympics under the name Russian Olympic Committee, but every time I try to show up to the club in VIP under the name Trevor Noah, folks got a problem.

entertainment,“The Daily Show with Trevor Noah” correspondent Roy Wood Jr. has little time for the Russian athletes circumventing their country’s doping ban by competing under the Russian Olympic Committee banner at the Tokyo Olympics.

entertainment,The Berlin Film Festival in March handed out their first none-gendered awards. The Grammy Awards ceased separating male and female artists in 2012.
entertainment,"NEW YORK (AP) — The Gotham Awards, the annual New York ceremony for independent film, is the latest film honor to shift to acting categories that aren’t defined by gender."
entertainment,"Ryland James views his latest music video as the “celebratory conclusion” of a deeply personal, multiyear odyssey."
entertainment,The Gotham Film & Media Institute on Thursday said they will do away with best actor and best actress categories and replace them with “outstanding lead performance” and “outstanding supporting performance.”
entertainment,"While award shows like the Oscars, Emmys and Tonys have stuck with the traditional male- and female-designated categories, a growing number of other ceremonies have shifted to gender-neutral awards."
entertainment,"The song’s title, James said in an email, is taken from a series of emojis Ryan left on one of his Instagram posts just before the start of their relationship."

entertainment,"“I noticed it and somehow immediately knew he was someone special,” the 22-year-old pop musician explained, adding that the video itself is about “having fun being in love and finally being free to share it with the world.”"
entertainment,"“I’m queer,” James wrote. “That’s it. I won’t label myself beyond that as I’ve always been attracted to many different people of different genders throughout my life and feel like no label truly embodies my sexuality fully. I’m just me.”"
entertainment,"His artistic profile has grown considerably since then. In 2019, he dropped his breakout single, “Good to You,” and opened for Alessia Cara on her Pains of Growing Tour across both the U.S. and Canada. His self-titled debut EP was released last year, followed by “A Little Christmas,” a five-track collection of holiday songs. Music critics favorably compared his vocal stylings to Adele and Sam Smith."
entertainment,"In spite of those successes, James said he lived in constant fear over how his fans and loved ones would react if he lived openly as his true self. By February, however, he “couldn’t hold it in anymore” and came out publicly in a note posted to Twitter."
entertainment,"James rose to prominence in his native Canada in 2014 when he landed a spot on “The Next Star,” an “American Idol”-like musical competition series featuring contestants who are 15 years old or younger."
entertainment,"Nearly six months later, James has no regrets. The response to his coming out, he said, was “overwhelmingly positive” and encouraged him to mark “the beginning of a new era in my life” with “3 Purple Hearts.”"

entertainment,"“Thank you all so much again for the privilege and honor it has been for the past four years to work on this show,” McCain said. “It really has been incredible. It will be referenced in everything I do for the rest of my life. You women have been incredible to work with. The crew, the producers, everyone works so hard.”"
entertainment,"“Love has no borders or limitations,” he continued, after noting he had researched “conversion therapy” videos in an attempt to suppress his desires at first. “It’s eternal. It’s all encompassing. And it should always be given easily and unconditionally because every human being is connected as one at the end of the day.”"
entertainment,"McCain, who has often made headlines for her controversial remarks on the show, then thanked the audience for allowing her the space to share her opinions and perspective."
entertainment,"“You and I have had our disagreements, we’ve had our fights. We’ve also had some drinking moments, which were rather fun and interesting,” Behar later said in a send-off speech to McCain, adding that the conservative was a “formidable opponent.”"
entertainment,"McCain later quipped that she hoped “The View” executive producer, Brian Teta, can forgive her for “making his blood pressure rise for the past four years.”"
entertainment,"The veteran co-host was seen raising her eyebrows after McCain joked that she would be on the show for another month, and that the panel had four more weeks to “fight a little more.”"
entertainment,"“This has been a really wild ride the past four years of my life,” she continued. “It’s been honestly the best of times and the worst of times in all ways on and off the show.

entertainment,"“Everybody saw the image of Her Majesty sitting alone,” Phillips said of one of the most striking moments and photos that emerged from the 50-minute funeral. “It would have been the same for any other family, the hardest part is not being able to hug those closest to the person who’s been lost.” "
entertainment,"But despite all of the family’s support, they couldn’t comfort the queen at her late husband’s funeral, due to coronavirus restrictions. Only 30 people were allowed to attend the funeral, which took place on April 17."

entertainment,"“This is a funeral and we are not going to be drawn into perceptions of drama,” a Buckingham Palace spokesperson told People magazine at the time. “The arrangements have been agreed and represent Her Majesty’s wishes.”"

entertainment,"In an online statement posted shortly before DaBaby issued his apology on Monday, organizers of the Governors Ball said they do not “tolerate hate or discrimination of any kind.” The statement did not specifically mention DaBaby, but his name was absent from a fresh list of artists scheduled to perform at next month’s event."

entertainment,"“Jungle Cruise” stars Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt sat down for Wired’s autocomplete interview, answering questions based on the Google search feature. And one query asked: What’s wrong with The Rock’s abs?"

entertainment,"Though Meghan McCain appeared on “The View” Monday, she was notably absent from a segment with Mary Trump, who accused the conservative co-host of lacking the courage to face her."
entertainment,"The actress thanked her African colleagues, doctors, therapists, family and fans for their support in her recovery."
entertainment,"“It’s a shame that your colleague didn’t have the courage to come on and have this conversation with me,” Trump told the other co-hosts during a discussion about her uncle, former President Donald Trump, and his successful use of racism as a political platform. “But I appreciate that you were all willing to take up these very difficult subjects because racism, in my view, is at the heart of everything that’s wrong in 21st-century America.”"
entertainment,"Last year, when the then-president’s niece went on “The View” to discuss her book, “Too Much And Never Enough: How My Family Created The World’s Most Dangerous Man,” McCain accused her of trying cash in on her extended family.

entertainment,Jason Momoa had some choice words for a reporter who asked how the star felt about acting in scenes containing sexual violence in “Game of Thrones.”
entertainment,"The “Aquaman” star was recently interviewed by The New York Times about his career as an action star, and naturally some of his previous roles came up. One of his earliest and most prominent turns was as Khal Drogo, the captor-turned-lover to Emilia Clarke’s Daenerys Targaryen in the HBO fantasy series."
entertainment,"Times interviewer David Marchese asked Momoa if he now thinks “differently” about having acted in scenes depicting sexual assault, which “seem as if they belong to an older cultural moment.”"
entertainment,Drogo rapes Targaryen on their wedding night in the show’s pilot in a scene so violent that author George R.R. Martin ― who wrote the books the series was based on ― even spoke out against it. Martin noted that showrunners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss included that scene without running it by him. 
entertainment,The 42-year-old actor said that “it was important to depict Drogo and his style.”
entertainment,"“You’re playing someone that’s like Genghis Khan. It was a really, really, really hard thing to do. But my job was to play something like that, and it’s not a nice thing, and it’s what that character was. It’s not my job to go, ‘Would I not do it?’ I’ve never really been questioned about ‘Do you regret playing a role?’ We’ll put it this way: I already did it. Not doing it again,” he responded."
entertainment,"While the conversation moved forward, Momoa pivoted back to the subject later in the interview, saying it “left a bad feeling in my stomach.”"
entertainment,He told the Times:

entertainment,“Love Is Blind” star Giannina Gibelli says she and former beau Damian Powers are officially over.
entertainment,Gibelli appeared on E!’s “Nightly Pop” on Monday and shared an update on her and Powers after the events viewers saw during the “Love Is Blind: After the Altar” reunion special.
entertainment,"The special, which began streaming on Netflix in late July, checked in on the couples who got together back in 2018 during the first season of “Love Is Blind.” Fans of the show will remember that Gibelli was slated to marry Powers, got to the altar, said “I do,” and was met with an “I don’t.”"
entertainment,"Gibelli subsequently left the altar, leading many to believe that she and Powers were over."

entertainment,"On both “Nightly Pop” and again later in an interview with ET Online, Gibelli confirmed that she’s “officially single” and shared that she and Powers “haven’t been dating for a couple of months now.”"

entertainment,"“I’ve moved on. I feel really, really good. I’m definitely at a really good place in my life,” she shared with ET Online, going on to say that it’s the “first time in like three years I feel like I don’t have to keep some sort of my life private anymore.” "
entertainment,Gibelli said she and Powers had to be “under wraps about everything.”
entertainment,"“I was still trying to figure out, how does my life look without him in it? It’s been a long time but I feel really good. I’ve processed it all. I’m such at peace,” she said."
entertainment,"As for Farago, Gibelli also apparently reached out to her after the reunion special in an effort to clear the air."
entertainment,"“I did DM her and say like, ‘Hey, hope all is well.’ Like, ‘Hope all is well and good luck,’” Gibelli told Insider this week. “I don’t like having bad energy out there. I’m very karmic like that. So I was like, ‘Let’s just call it what it is and move on,’ because I’ve definitely moved on. To me, DMing her was really me accepting that I’ve moved on so much that it doesn’t even bother me.” "
entertainment,One of the original Rockford Peaches is joining the lineup of Amazon Studios’ “A League of Their Own” reboot series. 
entertainment,"Appearing on the “Everything Iconic with Danny Pellegrino” podcast last week, Rosie O’Donnell confirmed plans to appear on the show in a guest role. "
entertainment,"“I’m playing a bartender in one of the scenes at the local gay bar,” she explained. “I’m shooting it in the upcoming months.” "
entertainment,"O’Donnell made her feature film debut in the original “A League of Their Own,” which was released in 1992 and is regarded as a modern classic. The comedy chronicled the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, which was founded in 1943, and starred Geena Davis, Tom Hanks and Madonna. "
entertainment,"“I love the ‘Broad City’ women,” she said. “When I was told [Jacobson] was doing ‘League,’ she called me up and said, ‘Ro, would you do it?’ And I said, ‘In a minute.’ Then she sent me the pilot that she did and it was just really beautiful.”"
entertainment,An Amazon representative did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment on O’Donnell’s involvement in the new series. 
entertainment,"O’Donnell has frequently credited the original “A League of Their Own” with catapulting her to Hollywood fame after years on the standup comedy circuit, as well as fostering her friendship with Madonna. She reiterated that point in her chat with Pellegrino, noting she couldn’t be happier with what she’s seen of the reboot thus far."
entertainment,"Later in the interview, O’Donnell revealed that she’d always seen Doris Murphy ― her role in the original “A League of Their Own” ― as a gay woman, even though the character never identified as a lesbian in the film. "
entertainment,"The series reboot will be co-created by Abbi Jacobson of “Broad City” and is billed as “a reinterpretation” of the original film that “takes a deeper look at race and sexuality,” according to Entertainment Weekly. In addition to Jacobson, the confirmed cast includes Chanté Adams, D’Arcy Carden, Gbemisola Ikumelo and Nick Offerman. "
entertainment,"“She had that speech where she says, ‘I never really felt like a real girl. I always felt like a fake girl, not even a girl, but now there’s a lot of us and I feel like we’re all OK’ — I did that in the bus and [director] Penny Marshall goes, ‘Rosie, do it again. It’s not like a gay thing.’”"
entertainment,"“So I played it the way I played it,” she added. “But again, to me, that was a gay character.”"

entertainment,"Chrissy Teigen is back on Instagram chronicling her travels, following a return to social media after apologizing for her role in bullying a teenage Courtney Stodden about a decade ago. "
entertainment,"Teigen told followers all about attending a UNICEF Summer gala in Capri, Italy, where her husband, John Legend, performed on Sunday."
entertainment,"The model said it was “trippy” to attend the event, as it was her “first sober Italian getaway.” "
entertainment,"“It was so so trippy being sober at something you typically would have been wasted at,” the 35-year-old said. “That paired with all the crazy hot young models and club dudes and seeing your young self over and over, oh man it was crazy.”"
entertainment,"“Anyhow I dunno. I’m rambling. we had so much fun,” the “Lip Sync Battle” host added. “I didn’t do anything I’d regret and I’m glad I’ll get to remember it all!!”"
entertainment,Teigen previously told followers in December 2020 that she was giving up alcohol.
entertainment,"The model said at the time that she was “done with making an ass of myself in front of people (I’m still embarrassed), tired of day drinking and feeling like shit by 6, not being able to sleep.” "
entertainment,"The comments are similar to a 2017 interview Teigen did with Cosmopolitan, in which she said she went to Bali for a wellness retreat to reset her relationship to alcohol."
entertainment,"“I was, point blank, just drinking too much,” she said at the time. “I got used to being in hair and makeup and having a glass of wine. Then that glass of wine would carry over into me having one before the awards show. And then a bunch at the awards show. And then I felt bad for making kind of an ass of myself to people that I really respected.” "
entertainment,"
“And that feeling, there’s just nothing like that,” the “Cravings” author added. “You feel horrible. It’s not a good look for me, for John, for anybody.”"

entertainment,The actor addressed his controversial comments in a statement released on Monday night after revealing in a profile for The Sunday Times that he only just recently stopped using the “f-slur for a homosexual” at the behest of his daughter. 
entertainment,"“I said, ‘I retire the f-slur!’ I understood,” Damon told the outlet, leaving many to wonder exactly why he was just coming to this realization. "
entertainment,"In the piece, Damon said that he used the word “months ago” as part of a joke, which prompted one of his children to write a “treatise” on “how that word is dangerous.” "
entertainment,"Hunting for some goodwill after an interview anecdote gone terribly wrong, Matt Damon is clarifying that he doesn’t “use slurs of any kind” and firmly stands with the LGBTQ community. "
entertainment,"Now, the Oscar winner is claiming that he has “never called anyone ‘f****t’ in my personal life” and elaborating on what he was trying to convey in the exchange. "
entertainment,"“During a recent interview, I recalled a discussion I had with my daughter where I attempted to contextualize for her the progress that has been made — though by no means completed — since I was growing up in Boston and, as a child, heard the word ‘f*g’ used on the street before I knew what it even referred to,” Damon said in a statement provided to People. “I explained that that word was used constantly and casually and was even a line of dialogue in a movie of mine as recently as 2003; she in turn expressed incredulity that there could ever have been a time where that word was used unthinkingly. To my admiration and pride, she was extremely articulate about the extent to which that word would have been painful to someone in the LGBTQ+ community regardless of how culturally normalized it was. I not only agreed with her but thrilled at her passion, values and desire for social justice.” "
entertainment,"“I have never called anyone ‘f****t’ in my personal life and this conversation with my daughter was not a personal awakening,” he continued. “I do not use slurs of any kind. I have learned that eradicating prejudice requires active movement toward justice rather than finding passive comfort in imagining myself ‘one of the good guys.’”"
entertainment,"Damon concluded his message by saying, “Given that open hostility against the LGBTQ+ community is still not uncommon, I understand why my statement led many to assume the worst. To be as clear as I can be, I stand with the LGBTQ+ community.”"
entertainment,"In the Sunday Times interview, he even mused on how his words can often be mischaracterized when speaking to the press, claiming that he’s learned to “shut the f**k up more” due to his numerous missteps. "
entertainment,"Media blunders have become an increasingly common occurrence for Damon, who has found himself in similar hot water for once dismissing a colleague’s concerns about diverse hiring practices behind the camera and lightly suggesting that gay actors should stay in the closet to preserve an air of “mystery.”"
entertainment,"
“The conversations that have arisen after Matt Damon’s original interview and subsequent remarks today are an important reminder that this word, or any word that aims to disparage and disrespect LGBTQ people, has no place in mainstream media, social media, classrooms, workplaces, and beyond,” Ramos said in a statement to HuffPost. “There needs to be accountability at a time when anti-LGBTQ slurs remain rampant today and can fuel discrimination and stereotypes, especially when used by those outside of the community to defame or describe LGBTQ people.”

After Damon issued a follow-up to his initial comments, GLAAD’s Head of Talent Anthony Allen Ramos also released a statement about the controversy."
entertainment,"Pennsylvania Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb made his long-expected bid for Senate official on Friday, becoming the latest entrant into a crowded primary field. "
entertainment,"“I believe this is the most important Senate seat in the country,” Lamb said in a video announcing his decision. “We have to build our majority, and tell the truth about what’s going on in people’s lives.”"
entertainment,Lamb is set to embark on a statewide tour after a rally in Pittsburgh on Friday afternoon.
entertainment,"With GOP Sen. Pat Toomey retiring, Pennsylvania is seen as the Democratic Party’s best chance to pick up a Senate seat in 2022, when control of the Senate — which is currently 50-50 — will be up for grabs."
entertainment,Lamb spends much of the video discussing the threats former President Donald Trump and the GOP pose to democracy — and notes that he has won three races after Trump came to campaign for his opponents.
entertainment,"“We won’t win this race on Twitter,” Lamb says in his launch video, perhaps alluding to a common centrist putdown of the party’s progressive wing as overly focused on winning over social media users rather than voters."
entertainment,"Lamb, a Marine veteran and former prosecutor, received national attention for his victory in a staunchly Republican congressional district in a 2018 special election that presaged the 2018 Democratic midterm wave. Since then, he’s won reelection twice in a swing seat. Lamb has often broken with his party, voting against legalizing marijuana and for making the GOP’s 2018 tax cuts permanent. "
entertainment,"While the narrative is likely to focus on Lamb and Fetterman, the financial firepower of EMILY’s List and the makeup of the primary electorate — a majority of voters will be women — make Arkoosh a clear sleeper candidate. Kenyatta has also won endorsements from the state teachers’ union and other progressive groups."
entertainment,"Much of the early attention on the race will pit Lamb and Fetterman against each other, as they represent opposite ideological ends of the party. While Fetterman has also occasionally broken with the party’s left flank on fracking and other issues, he is likely to suggest that Lamb would be an unreliable vote for President Joe Biden’s agenda."
entertainment,"Democrats believe they have a strong field of candidates, but first they’ll be pitted against one another. Lamb will face early frontrunner John Fetterman, the state’s progressive lieutenant governor; Montgomery County Commissioner Val Arkoosh, who has the backing of EMILY’s List and hails from the populous Philadelphia suburbs; and progressive state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who represents the city of Philadelphia and would the first openly gay Black senator, and one of the youngest senators ever elected."
entertainment,"Lamb, meanwhile, will suggest that Fetterman’s more left-wing approach means Democrats are less likely to win the seat November."
entertainment,"The GOP field for the seat is still developing. Businessman Jeff Bartos, Army veteran Sean Parnell and former Ambassador to Denmark Carla Sands are seen as leading candidates. "
entertainment,The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and other national Democratic leaders are expected to stay out of the primary. 
entertainment,"The covers of the 2021 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue were revealed on Monday, featuring the 26-year-old “Thot Shit” singer as well as tennis great Naomi Osaka and transgender model Leyna Bloom."

Dolly Parton opened up about the “best” thing she bought with royalties from her song “I Will Always Love You,” revealing this week that it was an investment in a Black community.
The country music legend sat down with Andy Cohen during a virtual appearance on “Watch What Happens Live” and was asked about her royalties from “I Will Always Love You.” Fans of the song know and love it as a classic Whitney Houston hit that appeared in the 1992 film, “The Bodyguard,” but the song was originally written and recorded by Parton in 1973.
With Houston, the song went on to top the charts for months and became one of the bestselling singles of all time. It also racked up numerous awards, including two Grammys. Parton reportedly earned $10 million from the cover, according to Yahoo Finance.
"
entertainment,"
That $10 million apparently went into Parton’s “big office complex in Nashville,” which she says was part of a Black community.
“I thought, ‘Well, this is a wonderful place to be.’ I bought a property down in what was the Black area of town, and it was mostly just Black families and people that lived around there. It was just off the beaten path from 16th Avenue and I thought, ‘Well, I am gonna buy this place — the whole strip mall,’” she told Cohen, before adding: “And I thought, ‘This is the perfect place for me to be,’ considering it was Whitney. I thought this was great — I’m just gonna be down here with her people, who are my people as well. So, I just love the fact that I spent that money on a complex and I think, ‘This is the house that Whitney built.’”
There were rumors over the years that Parton and Houston had a feud over the song, but both women had publicly dispelled them.Houston told Rolling Stone in an interview in 1993 that she had spoken to Parton on the phone and told her that she “wrote a beautiful song.”“I think Dolly Parton is a hell of a writer and a hell of a singer. I was concerned when I sang her song how she’d feel about it, in terms of the arrangement, my licks, my flavor. When she said she was floored, that meant so much to me,” shared Houston at the time.
Ten years later, in an interview with Larry King in 2003, Parton told him, “There was a tabloid story saying that Whitney and I were in a big feud, she said it was her song and I said it was mine. None of that was ever true.”
“I was so flattered, so honored and so lucky that she did it, because the song didn’t sound like that when I had it. You know, it’s kind of like you should have heard it when I had it by myself. But she did great, and everybody has their own interpretation of a song,” she said."
entertainment,The fourth episode of the Paramount+ legal drama features a scene in which Liz (played by Audra McDonald) and a television executive (Wayne Brady) talk about what topics can be used for comedy.
entertainment,Representatives for “The Good Fight” did not comment on the matter Tuesday.
entertainment,The writers of “The Good Fight” were hit with online criticism this week for including a reference to Selena Gomez’s kidney transplant in a discussion about “cancel culture.” 
entertainment,"In 2017, Gomez revealed that she’d received a kidney transplant as a result of having lupus, an autoimmune disease that can cause damage to many organs. Her donor was actor and longtime friend Francia Raisa. "
entertainment,"“It was what I needed to do for my overall health,” Gomez wrote on Instagram at the time alongside a photo of her and Raisa holding hands in adjacent hospital beds."
entertainment,"“How miserable do you have to be to take someone’s trauma/illness/struggles and use them for jokes, like just be a decent human being,” another added."
entertainment,"Their discussion prompts Jay (Nyambi Nyambi) to lament that comedians “need a permission slip to tell a joke.” After Jay wonders aloud which subjects would be considered off-limits, the character Jim (Ifádansi Rashad) responds, “Selena Gomez’s kidney transplant.”"
entertainment,"“Show some respect to her, she is such an unproblematic celebrity, she loves her Selenators so much,” one person wrote on Twitter. “She didn’t get the credit she deserves, Don’t make jokes on such an important issue.”"
entertainment,"After the episode aired, Gomez fans ― many of whom refer to themselves as “Selenators” ― expressed their distaste for the gibe against their idol on social media, prompting the phrase “RESPECT SELENA GOMEZ” to trend this week."
entertainment,“The Good Fight” isn’t the first TV series to be called out for mentioning Gomez’s kidney transplant.
entertainment,"“It was never our intention to make light of Selena’s health,” the statement read. “We have been in touch with her team and will be making a donation to her charity, The Selena Gomez Fund for Lupus Research at USC.”"
entertainment,"In 2020, an episode of Peacock’s “Saved by the Bell” reboot faced backlash for a scene in which two characters argue over who donated their kidney to the singer. Suggestions included Demi Lovato and Justin Bieber’s mother."
entertainment,"Days later, Peacock executives issued a statement apologizing for the episode and removed the scenes from the streaming platform."
entertainment,"Matt Damon, famously a father of daughters, had to be taught by his children that he’s not supposed to use homophobic slurs mere months ago. "
entertainment,"For some reason, the “Stillwater” actor volunteered this information in a new interview with The Sunday Times, in which he ruminated on the changing definitions of masculinity in Hollywood and his numerous media missteps. "
entertainment,"The Oscar-winner, who has three daughters with wife Luciana Barroso, revealed that during a recent meal with his family, he used what the outlet noted is “the most taboo term for gay people” much to the dismay of one of his children, who are aged 15, 12 and 10."
entertainment,"“The word that my daughter calls the ‘f-slur for a homosexual’ was commonly used when I was a kid, with a different application,” he told the outlet. “I made a joke, months ago, and got a treatise from my daughter. She left the table.”"
entertainment,"And yet, Damon seemingly has yet to learn his lesson — even while reflecting on how his thoughtless remarks can quickly become international news."
entertainment,"In a later interview with Ellen DeGeneres, he claimed his comments were mischaracterized, saying that he was “just trying to say actors are more effective when they’re a mystery.”"
entertainment,"This isn’t the first time Damon has put his foot in his mouth when it comes to the LGBTQ community. On a disastrous press tour in 2015, he lightly argued in favor of gay actors staying in the closet."
entertainment,"His admission struck many fans as particularly frustrating, given that he is a 50-year-old man living in the year 2021. "
entertainment,"“I said, ‘Come on, that’s a joke! I say it in the movie “Stuck on You!”’” Damon continued, referencing the much-derided 2003 film — yes, a movie that came out nearly 20 years ago. “She went to her room and wrote a very long, beautiful treatise on how that word is dangerous. I said, ‘I retire the f-slur!’ I understood.”"
entertainment,"“So Matt Damon just figured out ‘months ago’, by way of a ‘treatise’ from a child, that he’s not supposed to say the word f*ggot,” comedian Travon Free wrote on Twitter."
entertainment,"Using a bizarre analogy, he said, “Twenty years ago, the best way I can put it is that the journalist listened to the music more than the lyrics [of an interview]. Now your lyrics are getting parsed, to pull them out of context and get the best headline possible.”"
entertainment,"“So not only did this 50-year-old man need to be taught this, but he had to be taught by his daughter because, apparently, he was walking around saying it in front of her enough that she had to stop him,” another Twitter user added. “Trash.” "
entertainment,"“I’m around the same age as Damon + I’ve known this word was a slur since my teens. Pretty incredible amount of privilege to *just* realize it now,” a different person wrote. "
entertainment,"“Before it didn’t really matter what I said, because it didn’t make the news,” he continued. But maybe this shift is a good thing. So I shut the fuck up more.”"

entertainment,WASHINGTON (AP) — Anger and frustration mounted in Congress as a nationwide eviction moratorium expiredat midnight Saturday — one Democratic lawmaker even camping outside the Capitol in protest as millions of Americans faced being forced from their homes.
entertainment,"“There can be no excuse for any state or locality not accelerating funds to landlords and tenants that have been hurt during this pandemic,” he said in a statement late Friday."
entertainment,Biden set off the scramble by announcing Thursdayhe would allow the eviction ban to expire instead of challenging a recent Supreme Court ruling signaling this would be the last deadline.

entertainment,The White House has been clear that Biden would have liked to extend the federal eviction moratorium because of the spread of the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. But there were also concerns that challenging the court could lead to a ruling restricting the administration’s ability to respond to future public health crises.

The adventure movie was estimated to open with around $25 million to $30 million domestically, but it outpaced those numbers despite the surge in the coronavirus cases."
entertainment,"Those who work in emergency medical services are often poorly paid and highly stressed, with many agencies begging for donations for everything from food to equipment. Oliver noted that EMS isn’t even considered an essential service in 39 states, so local governments don’t have to provide it."

Ladies, if your pussy smell like water, put your cellphone lighter up! Fellas, if you ain’t sucking dick in the parking lot, put your cellphone lighter up!”"

entertainment,"A group of Republican senators has reintroduced legislation to strip the federal government of its authority over leasing, permitting and regulating energy development on federally controlled acres."
entertainment,"The so-called Federal Land Freedom Act would “give states the right to develop all of the energy resources on the federal lands located within the state’s borders,” reads a press release from co-sponsor Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.). It would also exempt energy activity from requirements of landmark environmental laws, including the Endangered Species Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, as well as reverse the flow of royalties, with companies paying those fees directly to states instead of the federal government."
entertainment,"The bill’s primary sponsor is Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), a longtime climate change denier who famously brought a snowball to the Senate floor in 2015 in a sad attempt to demonstrate that global warming was a hoax. Other co-sponsors are Sens. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Ted Cruz (R-Texas), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), James Lankford (R-Okla.) and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho)."
entertainment,"The change would not impact tribal, national park, national refuge or wilderness-designated lands."
entertainment,"In a statement accompanying the release, Cramer said the Biden administration has “worked to hamstring American energy production” and that the bill “would give North Dakota greater control over how to best utilize Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service lands within our borders.”"
entertainment,"It is a dream bill for America’s oil and gas sector, as states are often much more friendly to extraction than the federal government. In fact, in his press release, Cramer noted just two organizations that support the bill: the North Dakota Petroleum Council and the Lignite Energy Council, a coal industry group."
entertainment,"These seven Republicans have collectively received more than $10 million in oil and gas industry contributions over their careers in Congress, according to Center for Responsive Politics data."

“She asked me on New Year’s Eve,” the “Dr. Death” star said. “We were in Nicaragua. It was very beautiful ― incredibly romantic. We were walking down the beach and she asked me to marry her.”
The audience began to clap as Fallon said “wow” and asked if Turner-Smith had planned it.“There was like a preamble, there was a lead-up to it,” Jackson said, telling the late night talk show host that he “did not know” the proposal was going to happen.“But she was quite adamant and she was right. This is the best choice I ever made,” the entertainer said, as he took off his wedding ring and gazed at it lovingly, to more applause from the audience."
entertainment,The actors met in 2018 and tied the knot in 2019. They welcomed their first child together in April 2020.
entertainment,The “Queen & Slim” actor previously revealed that she first met Jackson at a party in 2018 and that the night ended with a one-night stand.

entertainment,"
“We had a one-night stand,” she quipped. “We’re in a two, three-year one-night stand now.”
All jokes aside, Turner-Smith told People magazine that Jackson is “so supportive and so loving” and that the two are “like mirrors for each other.”“We high five each other all the time about how great we chose,” she told the magazine with a laugh. “We’re like, ‘You did a great job choosing,’ and then we’re like, ‘Yeah, you too.’”"

On Monday, Alicia Silverstone ― who played Cher Horowitz in Amy Heckerling’s 1995 film ― paid homage to her iconic role in a TikTok with her son, Bear Blu.
Silverstone, 44, posted a video of herself acting as Cher, lip-syncing her own lines from the scene in the film where she’s getting ready to go out, but gets stopped by her father. Her father, played by Dan Hedaya in the movie, is portrayed by Bear in the TikTok.
“Cher, get in here,” mouths Bear-as-Cher’s-dad in the video, kicking off the hilarious exchange, which ends with Cher’s dad decrying her Calvin Klein dress as “underwear.”
"
entertainment,You can watch the original scene from the film below: 
entertainment,"Silverstone, who recently joined TikTok, has been using the platform to supply fans with a plethora of throwback content."

entertainment,"Bodyguards for troubled rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine turned New York City into the Wild West last summer, piling into SUVs and chasing a man for 20 blocks with lights flashing after he attempted to record cellphone video of the recording star, prosecutors said Monday."
entertainment,"Tekashi 6ix9ine, whose real name is Daniel Hernandez, was not charged."
entertainment,"Five members of 6ix9ine’s security team, including a retired New York City police detective accused of lying and attempting to cover up the incident, were indicted Monday on robbery, false impersonation and other charges stemming from the pursuit last August in Harlem."
entertainment,"“A celebrity entourage is not a police department, and Manhattan is not the Wild West,” Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said in a written statement announcing the indictments."
entertainment,"“As alleged, these highly-compensated vigilantes caravanned through the streets of Harlem with sirens flashing in order to track a man down and steal and break his phone,” Vance said."
entertainment,"The former NYPD detective, Daniel Laperuta, falsely claimed to police officers and a 911 dispatcher that the man being chased had threatened 6ix9ine’s team with a gun, Vance said."
entertainment,"As the man wrestled with one of the bodyguards in an attempt to get the phone back, Laperuta approached with his hand on his holstered gun and another bodyguard pointed a stun gun at the man, Vance said."
entertainment,"The security team fled in the SUVs as an unmarked police car drove up with lights flashing, Vance said."
entertainment,"When 6ix9ine’s bodyguards finally confronted the man, boxing him in with their SUVs near the Apollo Theater, they knocked his cell phone out and stomped it, Vance said."
entertainment,"Laperuta’s lawyer, Todd Cushner, said he was reviewing the charges against the former detective."
entertainment,Laperuta pleaded not guilty Monday and was expected to post bail Monday afternoon. Other members of the security team were expected to be arraigned later Monday.
entertainment,"“For the most part, they’re unfounded,” Cushner said."
entertainment,Online court records didn’t list lawyers for the other members of Tekashi 6ix9ine’s security team who were charged. Messages seeking comment were left with lawyers who’ve represented the rapper in the past.
entertainment,"6ix9ine, a Brooklyn native, rocketed to fame as a hip-hop artist after becoming a social media phenomenon with millions of followers on Instagram. He had a multiplatinum hit song, “Fefe,” with Nicki Minaj, which peaked at No. 3 on the pop charts in 2018, and “Stoopid,” featuring the incarcerated rapper Bobby Shmurda."
entertainment,"Since then, he’s been in and out of court — and prison."
entertainment,"6ix9ine’s cooperation earned him leniency from prosecutors and scorn from fellow rappers, with Snoop Dogg calling him a “snitch.” In December 2019, 6ix9ine was sentenced to two years in federal prison. Just a few months later, a judge ordered him released to home confinement because of the COVID-19 pandemic."
entertainment,"Facing a mandatory minimum of 37 years in prison for gang crimes including allegedly orchestrating a shooting that left an innocent bystander wounded, 6ix9ine started cooperating with federal prosecutors and testifying against members of the gang, the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods."
entertainment,"He also testified that two men kidnapped him in July 2018, forcing him into a stolen car at gunpoint and stopping at times to beat and taunt him before taking him to his Brooklyn home and stealing a bag full of jewelry."
entertainment,"Testifying in 2019, Tekashi 6ix9ine explained to jurors that his role in the Nine Trey gang was to “just keep making hits and be the financial support ... so they could buy guns and stuff like that.”"
entertainment,"Asked what he got in return, 6ix9ine responded: “My career. I got the street credibility. The videos, the music, the protection — all of the above.”"

entertainment,"It’s a Danish kids’ show about a man with a massive, prehensile penis that does tricks and helps people."
entertainment,Really.
entertainment,"“The ‘Diller’ in ‘Dillermand’ is Danish slang for ‘penis,’ meaning that his name in English is basically ‘John Penisman,’ which is a perfect name for a man with a magical dong,” the “Last Week Tonight” host said. “It would actually be a great nickname for my own penis if I hadn’t already nicknamed it ‘Hugh Grant’ because it’s British, aging and I’ve been told it can be unpleasant to work with.”"
entertainment,"The kiddie program made its debut on Danish television earlier this year. And in the segment posted online on Sunday, Oliver explained why he can relate to “John Dillermand” personally, complete with an animated visual aid of his own:"

entertainment,"“WDYM MOM AND DAD,” another person commented, while someone else asked, “Baby on the way?”"
entertainment,The Biebers have been married for just under three years and have been vocal about wanting to have children in the future.
entertainment,"A few hours later, Hailey Bieber piped up with a clarification: “I think u should maybe change this caption to *Dog Mom and Dad* before anyone gets it twisted.”"
entertainment,"In May, Justin Bieber spoke with GQ about his desire to get married and have kids."
entertainment,"“I just felt like that was my calling. Just to get married and have babies and do that whole thing,” he said, adding that when it came to those “babies,” he and Hailey would be having them “not this second, but we will eventually.”"
entertainment,"“They’ve really found their groove as a married couple and are enjoying their time together,” the source said."
entertainment,"A month later, a source close to the couple told ET Online that the couple was “doing amazing and are so solid.”"
entertainment,"Two days have passed since Congress and the White House allowed the federal eviction moratorium to lapse, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is still holding out hope that President Joe Biden will do something about it. Biden’s administration isn’t budging."
entertainment,"“The money must flow, and the moratorium must be extended by the Administration,” Pelosi wrote, referring to rental assistance included in coronavirus relief legislation that hasn’t yet reached people who need it. "
entertainment,"In a letter to House Democrats Monday, Pelosi again said it was on the president’s administration to extend the moratorium as the delta variant of COVID-19 continues surging throughout the United States."
entertainment,"The Supreme Court ruled in favor of allowing the federal eviction moratorium to stay in place through July, but indicated that any further extension would need congressional authorization."
entertainment,"In an announcement Thursday that surprised lawmakers, the administration made clear it was up to Congress to extend the moratorium, citing a Supreme Court ruling from a month ago."
entertainment,"“On this particular issue, the president has not only kicked the tires, but double-, triple- and quadruple-checked,” Gene Sperling, a senior adviser to Biden, said Monday, adding that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been “unable to find legal authority” to extend the moratorium even in a more targeted manner."
entertainment,The White House has maintained it cannot act on the issue. The moratorium expired on Saturday.
entertainment,"But with only three days’ notice, the House could not muster enough votes among Democrats alone to pass an extension, since Pelosi and other top Democratic lawmakers have called on the administration to just do it on its own."
entertainment,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday afternoon that the White House is encouraging states and cities to establish their own eviction moratoriums for the next two months and urging landlords to delay evictions for at least 30 days. The White House is also looking into why states haven’t been able to distribute rental relief funds, approved by Congress last December and again in March, faster."
entertainment,Psaki’s comments came after a statement from Biden last Friday urging states and localities to distribute the rental relief funds as fast as possible.
entertainment,"While an extension on the executive level — essentially forcing the Supreme Court to rule on the issue again, as Pelosi is calling for — could buy renters some time, legal challenges would likely come immediately."
entertainment,"Sperling noted that on a “personal” level, he is concerned pushing a conservative-majority court to decide the fate of the moratorium once again could put other public health orders at risk."
entertainment,"Pelosi, in her letter Monday, said Congress would continue working to address legal concerns raised by the courts, but indicated her hands were tied."
entertainment,"The politics of extending the moratorium through Congress are extremely fraught. Even if House Democrats had reached an agreement to extend the ban, Senate Republicans have repeatedly objected to the policy. "
entertainment,"On Friday evening, the House attempted to pass an extension by unanimous consent, but it was blocked by House Republicans. The bill never made it to the Senate. The House is on recess through August, with lawmakers back in their home districts. "
entertainment,"Congress’ failure to act has spurred outrage from the party’s progressive wing. Democrats like Reps. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) and Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) protested the moratorium’s expiration through the weekend, sleeping on the steps outside the Capitol."
entertainment,"In the June Supreme Court ruling, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote he would allow the moratorium to stay in place for another month to allow more time for rental relief funds from the American Rescue Plan and COVID-19 relief bill passed in December to be distributed."
entertainment,"States and cities have ramped up the distribution of those funds recently, but it has been an extremely slow process. From January through June, only $3 billion of the $46-billion fund approved by Congress had been distributed, according to the Treasury Department "
entertainment,States have reported serious backlogs due to outdated programs that could take months to streamline.
entertainment,"In her letter, Pelosi also encouraged lawmakers to spend their time at home working to “urge the immediate disbursements of funds to tenants and landlords.”"
entertainment,"Meanwhile, low-income renters who have faced severe economic hardships during the pandemic are left as yet another casualty of partisan infighting in Congress."
entertainment,Blake Lively has had enough.
entertainment,The actor recently detailed the “frightening” lengths that paparazzi went to to photograph the star while out with her three children in New York City.
entertainment,"Lively explained it all in a comment she left on a Daily Mail Australia Instagram post. The post showed a split picture of her smiling and waving toward the camera, alongside another photo of her pushing her daughters in a stroller."
entertainment,"“The real story: My children were being stalked by a man all day, jumping out, and then hiding,” she wrote. “A stranger on the street got into words with them because it was so upsetting for her to see.”"
entertainment,"“You edit together these images to look like I’m happily waving, but that is deceitful,” the “Gossip Girl” alum commented on the since-deleted post. "
entertainment,"Lively said she was eventually able to reason with a photographer who would speak with her, and consented to pose for a picture. "
entertainment,"“When I tried to calmly approach the photographer you hired to take these pictures in order to speak to him, he would run away — and jump out again at the next block,” she explained. “Do you do background checks on the photographers you pay to stalk children? Where is your morality here? I would like to know. Or do you simply not care about the safety of children?”"
entertainment,"“They too understand this is dark and upsetting, that you pay people to stalk children,” she said. “Please stop paying grown-ass men to hide and hunt children. There are plenty of pictures you could’ve published without the kids. Please delete.”"
entertainment,"“I was able to agree to smile and wave and let them take my picture away from my children, if they would leave my children alone — because it was frightening,” she added. The actor ended her Instagram comment with a plea for the media outlet to “listen to your followers.” "
entertainment,"The post was deleted, though not before Lively’s comment was captured by the Instagram account Comments by Celebs. The actor saw that her comment was shared and thanked the account for bringing more awareness to the harassment she and her children faced, calling the experience “fucking scary.” "
entertainment,Lively also shared a tangible way for people to help discourage paparazzi from taking photos of children. 
entertainment,"“All are trying to service an audience. So if that audience makes it clear they don’t want something — like photos of children obtained by men frightening and stalking them — the publication or account will do what the audience wants,” Lively added. “It’s the only way that so many have already stopped. Because the people demanded it. So thank you to everyone who’s made that difference already.” "
entertainment,"“One simple thing people can do is stop following and block any publications or handles who publish kid’s pictures,” she said, adding that users should “feel free to report them” or DM them about why they aren’t following the outlet."
entertainment,"“It’s a simple way of only aligning with publications who have morality. And so many do,” she said. "
entertainment,Seth Meyers took apart the peculiar argument about COVID-19 vaccines that Brian Kilmeade made on Monday’s broadcast of “Fox & Friends.”
entertainment,"“If you want to go cliff-diving this weekend, you don’t have to check with me. It seems a little dangerous. But I’m not going to judge you,” Kilmeade said."
entertainment,"The Fox News host said he’d been vaccinated for the coronavirus, as had his colleagues, but: “If you didn’t get a vaccination, that’s your choice.”"
entertainment,"“It’s their choice,” Kilmeade interjected. "
entertainment,"Co-host Peter Doocy responded by strongly urging viewers to get vaccinated, noting that 99% of people now dying from COVID-19 were unvaccinated."
entertainment,Doocy added that the Biden administration’s plans to reintroduce mask mandates in some areas were a bid to protect the unvaccinated. 
entertainment,"“That’s not their job,” Kilmeade insisted. “It’s not their job to protect anybody.”"
entertainment,"″Yeah, if the government was supposed to protect you, they’d have a department for it, like the Department of Defense of something,” Meyers said on “Late Night.”"
entertainment,"“To address your cliff-diving analogy... Unlike COVID, cliff-diving is not contagious. And if it was contagious, I’d never leave the house,” Meyers added."
entertainment,"Fox News has faced a firestorm of criticism for its contribution to vaccine hesitancy as immunization rates lag and COVID-19 case counts soar in the U.S. due to the highly contagious delta variant. Health experts have advised everyone ― even people who are vaccinated ― to wear a mask, particularly in indoor public spaces, to protect themselves and others as the new variant takes hold."
entertainment,Watch the rest of Meyers’s commentary below:
entertainment,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits fell last week by 14,000 to 385,000 more evidence that the economy and the job market are rebounding briskly from the coronavirus recession."
entertainment,"The Labor Department reported Thursday that unemployment claims — a proxy for layoffs — dropped last week from a revised 399,000 the week before. The applications have mostly fallen steadily since topping 900,000 in early January. Still, they remain high by historic levels: Before the pandemic slammed the United States in March 2020, they were coming in at around 220,000 a week."
entertainment,"Since cratering in the spring of 2020, the U.S. economy has bounded back as the rollout of vaccines encourages businesses to reopen or return to normal operating hours and consumers to return to shops, restaurants and bars. The United States has been adding more than 540,000 jobs a month this year, and the Labor Department’s July jobs report out Friday is expected to show it tacked on nearly 863,000 more last month, according to a survey of economists by the data firm FactSet."
entertainment,The U.S. economy is still 6.8 million jobs short of where it stood in February 2020.
entertainment,"Companies are posting job openings — a record 9.2 million in May — faster than applicants are showing up to fill them. Many states have responded to business complaints of a labor shortage by ending expanded federal unemployment benefits meant to ease financial strains from the health crisis, including an extra $300 a week on top of traditional state benefits. The federal benefits are scheduled to expire nationwide Sept. 6."

entertainment,"“I’ve worn many hats over the years, both literally and figuratively, and my hope is that in telling my story — the highs and lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned — I can help show that no matter where we come from, we have more in common than we think. I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to share what I’ve learned over the course of my life so far and excited for people to read a firsthand account of my life that’s accurate and wholly truthful.”"

entertainment,"“Prince Harry will share, for the very first time, the definitive account of the experiences, adventures, losses, and life lessons that have helped shape him,” Random House announced."
entertainment,"“Covering his lifetime in the public eye from childhood to the present day, including his dedication to service, the military duty that twice took him to the frontlines of Afghanistan, and the joy he has found in being a husband and father, Prince Harry will offer an honest and captivating personal portrait, one that shows readers that behind everything they think they know lies an inspiring, courageous, and uplifting human story.”"
entertainment,"Monday’s announcement comes four months after Harry and his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, made worldwide news during their interview with Oprah Winfrey near the couple’s home in Montecito, California."
entertainment,"“There is a lot to work through there,” Harry said about his relationship with his father, who was divorced from Diana, Princess of Wales, at the time of her fatal car accident in 1997. “I feel really let down. He’s been through something similar. He knows what pain feels like. And Archie (Harry and Meghan’s son) is his grandson. I will always love him, but there is a lot of hurt that has happened.”"
entertainment,"Harry told Winfrey that he felt trapped by royal life and that his family cut off him financially and took away his security. He also acknowledged his relations were strained with his brother, Prince William."
entertainment,"Meghan spoke of feeling lonely and nearly suicidal before they left England last year and Harry acknowledged tension with his father, Prince Charles, over his decision to step back from his royal duties and his marriage to the biracial American actor."

entertainment,Britney Spears’ new attorney said Monday that his legal firm is acting“aggressively and expeditiously” to remove the pop star’s father from his role in her hotly debated conservatorship. 
entertainment,"Mathew Rosengart, the first attorney Spears has been able to choose herself since the conservatorship began in 2008, spoke about his plans outside the Los Angeles Superior Court."
entertainment,"“My firm and I are moving aggressively and expeditiously to file a petition to remove Jamie Spears unless he resigns first,” Rosengart told reporters of the singer’s father, who has maintained control of his daughter’s nearly $60 million fortune as one of her conservators for the past 13 years. "
entertainment,"“I want to thank Britney Spears for her courage and for her strength,” Rosengart added, referencing the singer speaking out against the conservatorship for the first time in court and over social media in recent weeks."
entertainment,"The system in place is “abusive,” Spears said in court last month, accusing her conservators of forcing her to use birth control, take mood-stabilizing drugs and perform against her will. "
entertainment,"“I would honestly like to sue my family, to be totally honest with you,” Spears said in court, where she’s fighting to end her conservatorship and regain control of her life, career and relationships."
entertainment,"Last week, a judge granted Spears one power: the ability to choose her own attorney in the conservatorship case. She went on to hire Rosengart, a prominent former federal prosecutor, who argued in court last week that the conservatorship was never appropriate in the first place. "
entertainment,"“If he loves his daughter, it’s time to step aside so Ms. Spears can move forward to a healthy, productive life,” the attorney said."
entertainment,"On Monday, Rosengart thanked Spears’ fans for the outpouring of support. "
entertainment,"Earlier Monday, the court reached no decision on whether Spears’ conservatorship, which she is forced to pay for with her own money, should cover the cost of security for Jodi Montgomery, one of her conservators. Another hearing was scheduled for next week. "

entertainment,"ALDEN, N.Y. (AP) — New York prison officials handed over convicted rapist Harvey Weinstein for transport to California on Tuesday to face additional sexual assault charges."
entertainment,"The disgraced movie producer was released by the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision at about 9:25 a.m., a department statement said, ending his lawyers’ protracted fight to have him remain in New York."
entertainment,"His spokesperson, Juda Engelmayer, said Weinstein’s lawyers had still been trying to negotiate an extradition waiver but that the transfer was expected “at some point.”"
entertainment,"“We will be fighting so that Harvey can receive his needed medical care and of course, so that he can be treated fairly,” Engelmayer said. “Due process, presumption of innocence and a fair trial are all still his right.”"
entertainment,Details of Weinstein’s travels were not immediately known.
entertainment,"A New York judge in June approved Weinstein’s extradition to California, denying his lawyers’ request to keep him at a state prison near Buffalo — where he is serving a 23-year sentence for a rape conviction last year — until the start of jury selection in the Los Angeles case."
entertainment,"Weinstein’s lawyer, Norman Effman, argued he should remain in Wende Correctional Facility’s hospital-like maximum-security setting while receiving treatment for maladies including a loss of eyesight."
entertainment,Stephen Colbert tore into Fox News on Tuesday for airing anti-vaccination conspiracy theories and other coronavirus misinformation even as surveys showed that many in the right-wing network’s core demographic were refusing the shot. 
entertainment,The California charges were announced shortly before Weinstein’s conviction in New York City on charges that he raped an aspiring actress in 2013 in a Manhattan hotel room and forcibly performed oral sex on a TV and film production assistant in 2006 at his Manhattan apartment.
entertainment,He is appealing that conviction.
entertainment,"Weinstein, 69, was charged in January 2020 with 11 sexual assault counts in California involving five women, stemming from alleged assaults in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills from 2004 to 2013. The charges include rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual battery by restraint and sexual penetration by use of force."
entertainment,"“It’s no surprise,” Colbert said. “It’s right there in Fox News’s slogan: ‘We report. You just died.’” "
entertainment,Colbert played a clip in which “Fox & Friends” host Brian Kilmeade said choosing not to take the COVID-19 vaccine was all about freedom and suggested that people who refuse the jab and don’t wear a mask are just like people who enjoy cliff-diving. 
entertainment,"“You don’t have to check with me,” Kilmeade said. “It seems a little dangerous, but I’m not gonna judge you.” "
entertainment,"“That analogy does work if you first strap that cliff-jumper to a group of old people,” he said."
entertainment,Colbert tweaked that comparison.

entertainment,"“No, you don’t. No, you don’t. That’s a lie,” Sanders said back. “If you call Nick ‘Nick’ you get cussed out on the spot. So don’t do that and treat me like Nick.”"
entertainment,"“I call Nick Saban ‘Nick,’” Suss replied."
entertainment,USA Today’s For the Win provided an example of Saban being called “Nick” without him objecting.

entertainment,"The couple has been keeping fans abreast of all the happenings throughout their pregnancy on both Instagram and YouTube, including when they shared the news with their parents and their gender-reveal party in March."

entertainment,"“I’m stressed about everything, overthinking everything, irritable, and exhausted. All I have room to think about is our little family and little man on the way,” she shared."
entertainment,"Johnson previously shared that baby number two was a bit of a surprise. After telling fans in a YouTube video that her firstborn had been the result of a 22-hour labor and C-section, she and her husband had decided to try again after getting the all-clear from their doctor."

entertainment,"“About two minutes,” quipped East in response."
entertainment,"On Tuesday, the video streaming giant announced it will offer video games in its existing subscription plans at no extra cost, but didn’t say when that service will launch or what kind of games it will be developing."
entertainment,"SAN RAMON, Calif. (AP) — Netflix reported its worst slowdown in subscriber growth in eight years as people emerge from their pandemic cocoons. So it’s adding a new attraction to its marquee: Video games."
entertainment,"The confirmation of the long-anticipated expansion came in conjunction with the release of Netflix’s latest earnings report. That financial breakdown showed the video service added 1.5 million subscribers during the April-June period. That’s slightly better than the modest increase that management forecast after the service stumbled to a sluggish start during the winter months, but still far below its growth rate in recent years."
entertainment,Netflix’s net gain of 5.5 million subscribers through the first six months of this year represents its weakest first-half performance since 2013 ― a time when the company was still rolling out more original programming as it branched out from licensing existing TV series and movies.
entertainment,"“The reason we’re doing them is to help the subscription service grow and be more important in people’s lives,” Netflix co-CEO Reed Hastings told investors during a Tuesday discussion."
entertainment,"Greg Peters, Netflix’s chief product officer, said the company will initially focus on mobile games before eventually expanding to consoles and TV sets as well. The games initially will be tied to Netflix’s most popular programming, Peters said, but standalone titles may be added to the, mix too. He even speculated that Netflix eventually may create a TV series or film inspired by one of its video games."
entertainment,"Now Netflix is taking another leap by offering video games that intends to produce itself as part of what it described as a multi-year expansion. The Los Gatos, California, company telegraphed the move last week when it disclosed the hiring of a veteran video game executive, Mike Verdu, to explore potential opportunities in another field of entertainment."
entertainment,"“There’s a a big, big prize here, and our job is to be really focused,” Peters said."
entertainment,"Despite this year’s growth slowdown, Netflix remains by far the world’s biggest streaming service in an increasingly competitive field that includes Walt Disney Co., HBO, Amazon and Apple. Netflix finished June with 209 million worldwide subscribers."
entertainment,"Netflix’s heft also has produced steady profits. The company earned $1.35 billion, or $2.97 per share, nearly doubling from the same time last year. Revenue rose by 19% from last year to $7.3 billion."
entertainment,"While no one expected Netflix to sustain that breakneck pace, the drop off in subscriber growth this year has been more severe than anticipated. Netflix shares have fallen by about 10% from their peak of $593.29 six months ago. The shares edged up slightly in extended trading after Tuesday’s news came out."
entertainment,"But the lackluster first-half numbers are a dramatic reversal from last year, when government-imposed lockdowns across the world thrust people into binge-watching frenzies while corralled at home. Already the world’s largest video streaming service when the pandemic began in March 2020, Netflix picked up 26 million subscribers during the first half of last year. ."
entertainment,"Netflix management has blamed part of this year’s slowdown to pandemic-induced production delays that left its video service with fewer proven hits. The Los Gatos, California, is expecting that problem to fade during the second half of this year with new-season releases of popular series such as “Sex Education” and “The Witcher,” as well as movies starring big-name stars such as Leonardo DiCaprio and Meryl Streep."
entertainment,"Even so, Netflix let down investors with a forecast calling for only an additional 3.5 million subscribers during the July-September period. That was well below analyst estimates for a third-quarter gain of 5.6 million subscribers, according to FactSet Research. The “quite underwhelming” guidance raised more worries about intensifying competition in video streaming, as well as the fallout from pandemic lockdowns ending, said CFRA analyst Tuna Amobi."
entertainment,"But if the move into video gaming pays off, it could eventually give Netflix more leverage to boost its prices. The company has already been gradually raising subscription costs in recent years, helping to boost its average monthly revenue per subscriber to $14.54 in its biggest market comprised of the U.S. and Canada. That’s a 16 % increase from $12.52 per month two years ago."
entertainment,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Kennedy Center Honors will return in December with a class that includes Motown Records creator Berry Gordy, “Saturday Night Live” mastermind Lorne Michaels and actress-singer Bette Midler.

entertainment,All will be honored on Dec. 5 with a trademark program that includes personalized tributes and performances that are kept secret from the honorees.
entertainment,"Deborah Rutter, president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, said the current plan is to pack the center’s opera house to full capacity and require all attendees to wear masks. But the plans remain fluid and Rutter said they’re ready to adapt to changing circumstances depending on the country’s COVID-19 situation."
entertainment,"“We don’t know for sure what it’s going to be like,” Rutter said in an interview. “But don’t you think we all deserve to have a party?”"
entertainment,"Midler, 75, has won four Grammy Awards, three Emmys, and two Tony Awards, along with two Oscar nominations. Her albums have sold over 30 million copies. In a statement, Midler said she was “stunned and grateful beyond words. For many years I have watched this broadcast celebrating the best talent in the performing arts that America has to offer, and I truly never imagined that I would find myself among these swans.”"
entertainment,"“We know how to do it now. We will make whatever adjustments we need,” Rutter said. “We’re going to be wearing masks right up until we don’t have to.”"
entertainment,"The 43rd Kennedy Center Honors class was delayed from December 2020 as the center largely shut down its indoor programming. A heavily slimmed-down ceremony was finally held in May of this year, with a series of small socially distanced gatherings and pre-taped video performances replacing the normal gala event."
entertainment,"Mitchell, 77, emerged from the Canadian coffee shop circuit to become one of the standard-bearers for multiple generations of singer-songwriters. In 2020, Rolling Stone magazine declared her 1971 album “Blue” to be the third-best album of all time. In a brief statement, Mitchell, said, “I wish my mother and father were alive to see this.

entertainment,"But the Kennedy Center Honors bring no such pressures, and Michaels said he intends to sit back in the special honorees box at the opera house and see what surprises the organizers have in store."
entertainment,"Not normally an on-stage performer, Michaels recalls the Mark Twain evening as “mostly nerve-wracking” because he spent the evening dreading the traditional end-of-night speech he had to deliver."

entertainment,Sports Illustrated Swimsuit editor MJ Day fired back at Megyn Kelly after the former Fox News host complained on Twitter on Monday that Naomi Osaka was being featured on the magazine’s 2021 cover. 
entertainment,"“It’s such bullying and it’s so unnecessary, and this woman did nothing wrong,” Day said during an appearance on People’s “People Every Day” podcast with host Janine Rubenstein on Tuesday."
entertainment,Day called out Kelly for bullying the 23-year-old tennis superstar and pointed out that the former cable news host spewed out vitriol directed at Osaka on a public platform without knowing the facts surrounding her Sports Illustrated shoot.
entertainment,"After images of Osaka’s cover were published on Monday, Kelly trolled the four-time Grand Slam champion for appearing on magazine covers after she decided to withdraw from the French Open and Wimbledon tournaments in the spring, citing the need to protect her mental health. "
entertainment,"Kelly responded to a tweet by right-wing sports commentator Clay Travis, who also trolled Osaka by attempting to connect her decision to exercise self-care with the timing of the release of some of her ongoing projects, including her appearance on the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue, which is due out in August."
entertainment,“Let’s not forget the cover of (& interview in) Vogue Japan and Time Mag!” Kelly responded.
entertainment,Day pointed out that Osaka shot her Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover in December 2020 — months before her May announcement that she would not do any press appearances at this year’s French Open.
entertainment,"“Well, first of all, we did that shoot back in December of 2020,” Day said on “People Every Day.”"
entertainment,"The editor said that she was so “triggered” by Kelly’s attacks that she shared screen grabs of Osaka’s shoot with a December 2020 timestamp on her Instagram Stories to prove the point that Kelly should have, at the bare minimum, done her due diligence."
entertainment,"“Let her live, let her make decisions for herself that protect her own well-being ... it’s at no cost to anyone. And also it’s just facts, we did this shoot back in December,” she added. "
entertainment,"Osaka also had a few words for the 50-year-old former Fox News anchor; she encouraged Kelly to “do better,” according to screenshots of a since-deleted tweet. "
entertainment,"“It broke my heart,” Day said, noting that Osaka is “living her life for the betterment of others, while also trying to pursue her own passion, which is tennis and fashion.”"
entertainment,"Kelly, who joined NBC in 2017 and was fired the following year for defending the use of blackface in Halloween costumes during a segment of her show, doubled down on her attacks on Osaka in a later tweet."
entertainment,"“Seeing as you’re a journalist I would’ve assumed you would take the time to research what the lead times are for magazines, if you did that you would’ve found out I shot all of my covers last year,” the tennis star reportedly tweeted. “Instead your first reaction is to hop on here and spew negativity, do better Megan.”"
entertainment,"She appeared bothered that Osaka blocked her on Twitter, chiding the athlete as only being “tough on the courts.”"
entertainment,"Elsewhere during her appearance on “People Every Day,” Day gushed over her experience working with Osaka on set in December, sharing that they shot the cover on a secluded beach with a small crew in Malibu. "
entertainment,"Asked about Osaka’s reputation for having a shy personality, Day said that the tennis great is “so sweet, she’s so soft-spoken, she speaks when she has something to say.”"

entertainment,Prince George turns 8! 
entertainment,Kensington Palace kicked off the young royal’s celebrations on Wednesday by continuing its standard practice of releasing birthday portraits one day early. The third in line to the throne will officially celebrate his birthday on Thursday.
entertainment,"New pictures taken by the Duchess of Cambridge show a beaming Prince George, smiling wide at the camera while wearing a navy and orange collared shirt and matching navy shorts."
entertainment,"The photo was snapped in Norfolk earlier this month, according to a Kensington Palace release shared with HuffPost. "
entertainment,"George, who is Prince William and Kate Middleton’s eldest child, was born at 4:24 p.m. on July 22, 2013, at St Mary’s Hospital in London."
entertainment,"Many thought that the portraits would show George in an England jersey, given the fact that he wore one in his beaming birthday portraits last year: "
entertainment,It was also thought that the young royal would wear something England-related because George didn’t wear a soccer jersey while attending two Euro 2020 matches in recent weeks alongside his parents.
entertainment,"Something tells us there will be even more to come ― and perhaps some YouTube appearances ― for the Cambridge kids in the future, especially going into the queen’s Platinum Jubilee year. "
entertainment,"Instead, the prince wore a suit and tie to the games, and cheered on the Three Lions with all his might during the finals: "
entertainment,"The England games were just another glimpse at the Cambridge kids, whose presence at royal engagements and appearances on social media have continued to increase over the past two years and especially during the pandemic. It’s a part of a new shift in Kate and William’s social media presence, which includes them becoming YouTubers. "
entertainment,The increased appearances means royal supporters also got to hear the Cambridge kids speak for the first time in a video posted on the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s Instagram last October. 
entertainment,"In the clip, George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis all ask broadcaster and naturalist Sir David Attenborough questions: "
entertainment,"A women’s rowing event was added to create a more inclusive Olympics, which meant four additional seats on the U.S. team and a spot for Luczak."
entertainment,Grace Luczak had left competitive rowing and taken a job in the private sector when a move toward gender equity at the Tokyo Games lured her back into a boat.
entertainment,"“It’s really hard to make the decision to come back, to plan financially to be out of work for a year,” Luczak said. She thought a second consecutive Games wasn’t possible for a veteran until the seats were added."
entertainment,“There are four more seats. Four. And it’s the first gender-equal Olympics. How can you not try?”
entertainment,"Most of the public attention goes to the big sports — gymnastics, swimming, track and field — but away from the spotlight, women from niche sports are being recognized and given an Olympics chance."
entertainment,"The International Olympic Committee added 18 new events to the Tokyo Games in a push toward gender equity. There are an equal number of women and men for every sport, excluding baseball and softball because of differing roster sizes."
entertainment,"The new opportunities come in several sports and several sizes: Great Britain, for example, is sending more women than men to the Olympics for the first time. In water polo, two additional teams were added, for a total of 10. It’s still two shy of the men’s tournament, but a win for the women’s movement."
entertainment,"The IOC said women’s participation in Tokyo will be 49%, up from 45% at Rio, a nearly even split with the men. The committee also noted that when women made their Olympic debut at the Paris Games in 1900, there were only 22 females out of 997 total athletes. Those pioneers competed across five sports, among them croquet and equestrian."
entertainment,"“Tokyo 2020 is predicted to be the most gender equal yet with female participation,” the IOC said."
entertainment,"Weightlifting this year is equal at seven teams for both men and women, but reached the mark by dropping a men’s team. Women’s canoeing was added, but the men’s 200 and men’s kayak double 200 were dropped — a decision met with unfavorable reaction from male athletes when it was announced in 2016."
entertainment,"Gains for women in many cases meant fewer opportunities for men. Boxing will feature 100 women in five classes, up from 36 fighters over three classes in Rio. But two men’s classes were dropped."
entertainment,"The changes went through, to multiple sports, with rifle probably undergoing the most change. The sport lost men’s prone rifle, men’s free pistol and men’s double trap, all replaced by mixed team events in air rifle, air pistol and trap."
entertainment,"Erik Vlcek, who took silver with Slovakia in Rio, argued when women’s canoe was added that females should only kayak because females canoeing “doesn’t look good.” A Czech paddler joked canoeing is harmful to a woman’s posture."
entertainment,"Luczak, now 32, knows she benefited at the expense of male teammates. The women’s coxless four returns to competition for the first time since 1992, but it replaces the men’s lightweight coxless four."
entertainment,"“It’s not great when you have to take something away from the men’s side to add to the women’s. It’s never fun seeing people find out their opportunity is gone,” Luczak said. “But in creating an equal number of opportunities, it shows there is a pathway for female athletes.”"
entertainment,"Luczak left her fiancé behind at home and moved in with a host family in Princeton, New Jersey, while she trained. She also traded a paycheck for a stipend, simply because the four additional seats were too tantalizing for her to not even try."
entertainment,Tightening the gender gap was a cause for many women. The equality issues were heightened when discrepancies for men and women were exposed at this year’s NCAA basketball tournament. Images shared on social media of the women’s grossly underequipped weight room became the symbol for the injustices all female athletes have suffered in the shadow of men.
entertainment,"Former Stanford water polo player Maggie Steffens said the gender inequality at the NCAA tournament “hurt my heart to see” but was also an eye-opener. Steffens is a two-time Olympic gold medalist, two-time Olympic MVP and captain of the U.S. women’s team, but she had always assumed the better-known women’s sports received better treatment than water polo."
entertainment,"“The women’s basketball teams are in the tournament, they have all these fans, they’re on TV and you think ‘Look how lucky they are,’” Steffens said. “But the behind-the-scenes stuff comes out and you find out they have it just the same as you."
entertainment,"“For it to all come out and see it from the athletes’ point of view, for what people don’t see to now be visible, maybe it showed that women can get it done. We don’t need all the fancy stuff, we don’t care. We’ll do it anyway.”"
entertainment,"Not every addition was a blow to men’s sports. Swimming added the 1,500-meter freestyle for women for the first time, while the men’s 800 free was returned to competition for the first time since 1904. The mixed gender relay makes its Olympic debut."
entertainment,"There are still large gaps to close, particularly in funding and prize money outside of the Olympics. Steffens this year saw a long push for equal pay at one particular tournament come to fruition and posted a photo of the triumph labeled #equalpay. Pioneer women’s water polo player Maureen O’Toole commented, “Wait what. You get paid!! That must be nice!!!” on the social media post."
entertainment,"Five new sports were added this year — baseball/softball, karate, skateboarding, sports climbing and surfing — and the IOC demanded they have equal numbers of men and women."
entertainment,"“It made me think, who in 20 years am I going to comment on and say, ‘Look at what you’re getting now?’” Steffens said. “It’s just amazing that this doorway is open and little girls who have dreams like I had can stand on my shoulders and make it farther and make it better.”"
entertainment,An important Tinseltown treasure had long been considered lost somewhere over the rainbow.
entertainment,"But members of the drama department at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., had a hunch that one of Judy Garland’s “Wizard of Oz” dresses was hidden somewhere in their facility, as The Washington Post reported earlier this month."
entertainment,"According to that article, McCambridge hoped the blue-and-white checked gingham dress would be “a source of hope, strength, and courage to the students.”"
entertainment,"Still, Matt Ripa, a lecturer and operations coordinator at CUA, had searched everywhere for the garment with no luck, and was almost convinced its presence at the school was about as real as a flying monkey."
entertainment,"In 1973, a story in CUA’s student newspaper The Tower described a “precious gift” that had been given to the school by Oscar-winning actor Mercedes McCambridge, an artist-in-residence in the university’s drama department at the time. McCambridge, the article said, was a “close friend” of Garland, who died in 1969."
entertainment,"That is, until June 7, when Ripa was cleaning out the building for a renovation and stumbled upon a trash bag sitting by the faculty mail slots with a note."
entertainment,"“I found this,” was all Thomas Donahue, a now-retired drama professor, had written in the note."
entertainment,"Ripa told the Post: “I was shocked, holding a piece of Hollywood history right in my hands.” "
entertainment,“I was curious what was inside and opened the trash bag and inside was a shoebox and inside the shoebox was the dress!!” Ripa recalls in a university archives blog post. “I couldn’t believe it.” 
entertainment,"Soon after the discovery, CUA contacted Ryan Lintelman, an expert in “Wizard of Oz” memorabilia, to weigh in on the frock’s authenticity."
entertainment,"Lintelman is a curator at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American History, which houses a pair of sparkling ruby slippers worn by Garland, a complete costume worn by Ray Bolger’s Scarecrow, and an original 1938 screenplay based on L. Frank Baum’s 1900 book, per Smithsonian magazine."
entertainment,"The museum’s curators don’t offer monetary evaluations of historical objects, but Lintelman did provide some juicy insights about the costume to Smithsonian magazine."
entertainment,"CUA now plans to preserve the garment in “proper storage in a temperature- and humidity-controlled environment,” according a university press release."
entertainment,"The recently found costume features many components that the other five dresses share, including a “secret pocket” where Garland would have kept her handkerchief, and the name “Judy Garland” written by hand on the piece. The handwriting is the same as on the other known dresses."
entertainment,Lintelman told the outlet that he and his colleagues determined that the CUA dress “numbers among just six known costumes ‘that have a good claim’ on being the real deal.”
entertainment,"The dress, the school said, is “not in Kansas anymore.”"
entertainment,"NEW YORK (AP) — “The View” canceled a planned appearance Wednesday by a woman who settled a sexual harassment lawsuit against Bill O’Reilly, after the former Fox News Channel personality sought and received a restraining order against her."
entertainment,"ABC’s daytime talk show, in a statement, said that after being notified of the restraining order “we decided to postpone her interview pending further developments. We look forward to welcoming her to ‘The View’ at a later date.”"
entertainment,"O’Reilly accused his former producer, Andrea Mackris, of violating a non-disclosure agreement by talking about her experiences with him nearly two decades ago."
entertainment,"Mackris gave an interview to the Daily Beast earlier this month detailing her experiences with O’Reilly. She had accused him of making repeated lewd telephone calls, while he accused Mackris of an extortion attempt before agreeing to a $9 million settlement in 2004. "
entertainment,"
Fox News in 2017 fired O’Reilly, then its most popular star, after it was revealed the company had paid five women a total of $13 million to keep quiet about disturbing encounters with him.
O’Reilly, in court papers filed this week in New York state Supreme Court in Nassau County, accused Mackris of violating the confidentiality obligations she had agreed to in her settlement. While Mackris apparently believes the terms don’t apply to her, “she has not offered to return any of the millions of dollars she received,” O’Reilly’s lawyers said.
Judge Randy Sue Marber, signed the restraining order Tuesday and ordered a hearing for July 26.
Mackris told the Daily Beast on Wednesday that “I hope the days of the law allowing the silencing of women are over. I will continue to fight for my voice.”
In the July 13 article for the website, Mackris spoke about her emotional distress and of being effectively blackballed in the news industry in the years following her case.
That article was co-authored by “contributing reporter” Diana Falzone, herself a former Fox News employee. Falzone settled a gender discrimination lawsuit against Fox, after she accused the network of abruptly taking her off the air when she wrote an article in 2017 detailing her struggles with endometriosis.
The Daily Beast disclosed Falzone’s Fox connection and settlement in an editor’s note at the end of the piece."
entertainment,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered a third attempt at passing a GOP voting bill on Thursday, calling another special legislative session to begin this weekend as Democrats who left the state weeks ago in protest still remain in Washington."
entertainment,The announcement was expected and comes as more than 50 Democrats — who scrambled to fly out of Texas on July 12 — were on the cusp of running out the clock on the current special session and torpedoing the sweeping voting package for a second time since May.
entertainment,"“I will continue to call special session after special session,” Abbott said."
entertainment,"He ordered the new 30-day special session to begin Saturday and made a new elections package one of 17 items he instructed the GOP-Legislature to consider, which includes other items sought by conservative activists, including new border security measures and rules over how race is taught in public school."
entertainment,"The cross-country exodus marked the second time that Democratic lawmakers staged a walkout on the voting overhaul, which they say would make it harder for young people, people of color and people with disabilities to vote. But like the first effort in May, there remains no clear path for Democrats to permanently block the voting measures, or a list of other contentious GOP-backed proposals up for debate."
entertainment,"Abbott, who is up for reelection in 2022, made the decision to begin a new session immediately, as Democrats in Washington had been weighing their next steps. They left Texas under the threat of arrest for breaking quorum in the state House of Representatives and have not committed to when — or whether — they planned to return home."
entertainment,Some Democrats this week said they have no intention to return to the Texas Capitol even after they’ve returned from Washington.
entertainment,"“A vast majority, enough to break quorum, have committed to each other to not be in the Capitol when the second called session happens,” Democratic state Rep. Eddie Rodriguez said Wednesday."
entertainment,"In choosing to hunker down in Washington, Texas Democrats sought to put pressure on President Joe Biden and Congress to pass new federal voting rights legislation that would blunt the impact of the GOP bill back home. A group of key Democratic senators, including West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, met Wednesday in Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s office to discuss a compromise on voting legislation."
entertainment,"The group has been working for weeks with their counterparts in the U.S. House to develop a narrower approach. But even with a retooled bill, they would still face the same challenge as before: a filibuster by Senate Republicans, who overwhelmingly oppose the measure. Overcoming that hurdle would require changes to Senate procedural rules, which many moderate Democrats oppose — denying the party the votes to change the rule."

entertainment,"Arians’ comment led ESPN to check with the NFL about the stipulation, and league spokesperson Brian McCarthy verified that Arians’ interpretation of the rule was correct. Prevention guidelines have emphasized daily testing, masking up and social distancing for unvaccinated players."

The Dallas Cowboys quarterback was mocked recently for erroneously trying to cite a health care privacy law for avoiding a reporter’s question as to whether the star was vaccinated. Far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) previously used the same strategy.

entertainment,Then the tennis superstar talked to the media again after shunning press conferences and eventually withdrawing from the French Open in May to preserve her mental health. Bouts of anxiety had prompted her to rethink subjecting herself to probing questions about her performance.

entertainment,"Mason died Saturday at 6 p.m. ET at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Manhattan after being hospitalized for over two weeks, the celebrity lawyer Raoul Felder told The Associated Press."
entertainment,"The irascible Mason was known for his sharp wit and piercing social commentary, often about being Jewish, men and women and his own inadequacies. His typical style was amused outrage."
entertainment,"His death was mourned far and wide, from fellow comedian Gilbert Gottfried, who called him “one of the best,” to Fox News Channel personality Sean Hannity, who hailed Mason as “irreverent, iconoclastic, funny, smart and a great American patriot.” Henry Winkler tweeted: “Now you get to make heaven laugh.”
"
entertainment,"“Eighty percent of married men cheat in America. The rest cheat in Europe,” he once joked.

Mason was born Jacob Maza, the son of a rabbi. His three brothers became rabbis. So did Mason, who at one time had congregations in Pennsylvania and North Carolina. Comedy eventually proved to be a more persistent calling than God.
“A person has to feel emotionally barren or empty or frustrated in order to become a comedian,” he told The Associated Press in 1987. “I don’t think people who feel comfortable or happy are motivated to become comedians. You’re searching for something and you’re willing to pay a high price to get that attention.”
Mason started in show business as a social director at a resort in the Catskills. He was the guy who got everybody up to play Simon Says, quiz games or shuffleboard. He told jokes, too. After one season, he was playing clubs throughout the Catskills for better money.
“Nobody else knew me, but in the mountains, I was a hit,” Mason recalled.
In 1961, the pint-sized comic got a big break, an appearance on Steve Allen’s weekly television variety show. His success brought him to “The Ed Sullivan Show” and other programs.
He was banned for two years from the “Sullivan” show when he allegedly gave the host the finger when Sullivan signaled to him to wrap up his act during an appearance on Oct. 18, 1964.
Mason’s act even carried him to Broadway, where he put on several one-man shows, including “Freshly Squeezed” in 2005, “Love Thy Neighbor” in 1996 and “The World According to Me” in 1988, for which he received a special Tony Award.
“I feel like Ronald Reagan tonight,” Mason joked on Tony night. “He was an actor all his life, knew nothing about politics and became president of the United States. I’m an ex-rabbi who knew nothing about acting and I’m getting a Tony Award.”
Mason called himself an observer who watched people and learned. From those observations he said he got his jokes and then tried them out on friends. “I’d rather make a fool of myself in front of two people for nothing than a thousand people who paid for a ticket,” he told the AP.
His humor could leap from computers and designer coffee to then-Sen. John Kerry, former Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Donald Trump. He was able to articulate the average Joe’s anger, making the indignities of life seem funny and maybe just a little bit more bearable.
“I very rarely write anything down. I just think about life a lot and try to put it into phrases that will get a joke,” he said. “I never do a joke that has a point that I don’t believe in. To me, the message and the joke is the same.”
On TV, Mason was a reliable presence, usually with a cameo on such shows as “30 Rock” or “The Simpsons” or as a reliable guest on late night chat shows. He performed in front of Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II and his show “Fearless” played London’s West End in 2012.
He portrayed a Jewish ex-pajama salesman in love with an Irish-Catholic widow portrayed by Lynn Redgrave in a series called “Chicken Soup” in 1989 but it didn’t last. During the O.J. Simpson murder trial, the British Broadcasting Corp.’s Scottish service hired Mason as a weekly commentator. He was in “Caddyshack II,” a notorious flop.
Mason’s humor sometimes went too far, as when he touched off a controversy in New York while campaigning for GOP mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani against Democrat David Dinkins, who was Black. Mason had to apologize after saying, among other things, that Jews would vote for Dinkins out of guilt.
Felder, his longtime friend, told the AP that Mason had a Talmudic outlook on life: “That whatever you would say to him, he would start an argument with you.”
He is survived by his wife, producer Jyll Rosenfeld, and a daughter, Sheba.

entertainment,"The actor revealed during an interview with CBS’s “Sunday Morning” that his 15-year-old, Isabella, prefers to watch her father’s greatest flops and “give him shit” over some of his career choices, rather than watch anything he was “good” in. "
entertainment,The revelation arose after CBS News correspondent Seth Doane asked Damon whether people still connected him with “Good Will Hunting.” 
entertainment,"“Sure, yeah ― fewer and fewer,” the actor said. “You know, younger people don’t know it as much. You know, my 15-year-old refuses to see it. She doesn’t want to see any movies that I’m in that she thinks might be good.”"
entertainment,"“She just likes to give me shit,” Damon said, as he and Doane laughed. “My daughter said, ‘Yeah, remember that movie you did, “The Wall”?’ I said, ‘It was called “The Great Wall.”’ She goes, ‘Dad there’s nothing great about that movie.’” "

“I put it on for the kids at home,” he said, adding that he downloaded it from iTunes and narrated some of it for his family.“That was the one until [they watched ‘Ford v Ferrari’], because they came to the premiere,” Damon said. “So, that was cool. So, they’ve seen two of them.”
"
entertainment,"“I never was going to show it to them because I felt like it was kind of a movie for [adults],” he told People. “But their classmates had seen it and so other parents at the school were saying, ‘Oh my daughter loved it.’” "

“It’s total resistance,” the “Bourne Identity” star told People in 2019. “I am kind of trying to force them, it’s not working.”

entertainment,The country she represents? Maybe not so much anymore.
entertainment,The routines Simone Biles puts together are so difficult that she can afford a misstep or two and still dominate. (See the videos below.)
entertainment,"While the reigning Olympic gymnastics champion began her quest for a repeat by topping qualifying on Sunday, the four-woman U.S. team looks to have a serious fight on its hands if it wants to claim a third straight crown."
entertainment,"The Russians posted the top team score of 171.629 through the first three subdivisions at the Ariake Gymnastics Centre, the first time in more than a decade that the Americans failed to finish atop the standings during any portion of a major international event."
entertainment,"While Biles leads the all-around with a total of 57.731, it didn’t come easy. She stepped all the way off the mat following a tumbling pass on her floor exercise, then basically did the same on vault. She responded with a solid set on uneven bars, but a spectacular beam routine ended with her taking three major steps backward following her dismount."
entertainment,"The 24-year-old who came to Japan as the face of the U.S. Olympic movement saluted the judges with a wry smile, then walked off the podium with a smile that looked like a combination of relief, sarcasm and frustration."

entertainment,"The Americans arrived in Tokyo riding a decadelong winning streak, one fueled in large part by Biles’ unmatched brilliance. Her routines are packed with so much difficulty, it often becomes a matter of math."
entertainment,"For the first time in a long time, when the numbers were added up, the Americans found themselves looking up in the standings at someone else."
entertainment,"ROC’s performance’s offered proof that the former gymnastics superpower is in the midst of a resurgence led by 21-year-old Angelina Melnikova. Even better, the Russians survived the balance beam relatively unscathed."
entertainment,"The 4-inch piece of wood set 4 feet off the ground has been the place where the country’s gold-medal hopes have gone to die in recent years, yet there were no major issues during qualifying. The only major miscue came when Lilia Akhaimova fell off during the end of an acrobatic series."
entertainment,"No biggie. The Russians were allowed to drop her score. Things will be different in the finals, when the meet goes to a “three up/three count” format in which there is no margin for error. While Melnikova stressed that she was not going to forecast what might happen on Tuesday, she does believe what once was a walkover for the Americans will turn into something far more compelling."
entertainment,Jordan Chiles’ remarkably consistent run that carried her to a spot on the four-woman team ended with a major mistake on bars and a fall on beam. Sunisa Lee overcame a so-so performance on floor to surge into second behind Biles with an electric bar routine.
entertainment,"“We hope that (we win),” Melnikova said. “We’re also going to struggle and fight. We have to. That’s the expectation for us.”"
entertainment,"“So, I did a thing,” she wrote in the post’s caption. “The movies always show women cutting their hair when all is lost but I wanted to know the feeling of making a change when things are gravy. It hits different and its foreign to me but I [love] this new new.” "

entertainment,"“The images that I saw on TV and in magazines and film reaffirmed what they were saying,” she continued. “That I wasn’t ‘it,’ and people who look like me aren’t ‘it.’ You couldn’t possibly have that ‘it factor’ and have hair like mine or skin like mine.”"
entertainment,Union explained that as she got older she realized how beautiful and resilient her natural hair is ― in spite of anti-Black societal messages conveying otherwise.

entertainment,"At age 33, Bear Bailey thought his dream of being a singer was dead. Then TikTok and his local gas station helped bring it back to life."
entertainment,"Bailey has gained more than a million TikTok followers in less than two weeks since he started posting videos from the Super Serve station near his home in Houma, Louisiana.

He called COVID-19 a “scamdemic.”"
health,Hair told NBC affiliate WPTV: “I was one of one the people like him who didn’t trust the vaccine. I trusted my immune system. I just became more afraid of getting COVID-19 than I was of any possible side effects of the vaccine. I’m glad I got vaccinated.”

health,"Tsimanouskaya was expected to head to Warsaw later Wednesday, according to Krivosheyev."
health,"Tsimanouskaya’s experience at the Tokyo Games became an international issue after she accused Belarusian team officials of hustling her to the airport several days ago and trying to put her on a plane to Belarus because she had criticized the team’s management on social media. The team officials said she would face reprisals back home, she said."
health,"Reached by phone Tuesday, Dzmitry Dauhalionak, the head of Belarus’ delegation at the Summer Olympics, declined comment, saying that he has “no words.”"

health,She added that she believed she would be kicked off Belarus’ national team.
health,Tsimanouskaya’s criticism of how officials were managing her team set off a massive backlash in state-run media in Belarus. The runner said on Instagram that she was put in the 4x400 relay even though she has never raced in the event. She was then barred from competing in the 200 meters.

health,Harris president and CEO Esmaeil Porsa said Wednesday that the system was already “in crisis mode” with a critical shortage of staff and beds amid a surge in COVID-19 cases.
health,"“She needed to be intubated immediately because she was having seizures,” Patricia Darnauer, the administrator for Houston’s Lyndon B. Johnson Hospital, told ABC-6 TV. “We looked at all five major pediatric hospital groups” in Houston and “none” had appropriate beds available, she said."
health,"More than 50% of intensive care unit patients at LBJ Hospital have COVID, which is a “huge burden,” Porsa told KHOU-11. The wait time for treatment in the hospital emergency rooms was 24 hours."
health,"Harris Health System, which includes LBJ Hospital, shared videos and photos of the baby being wheeled to an air ambulance. She’s receiving treatment at Baylor Scott & White McLane Children’s Medical Center in Temple."
health,"Houston pediatrician Christina Propst said the situation with the airlifted baby underscores the dire situation facing young people amid the soaring delta cases, ABC-13 reported."
health,"“The emergency rooms at the major children’s hospitals here in Houston, the largest medical center in the world, are extremely crowded,” Propst said. “They are filling, if not [already] full — as are the hospitals and intensive care units.”"
health,"The delta variant of COVID is affecting more children and doing so more seriously, she warned."
health,"The respiratory syncytial virus, which affects children, is also increasing in the area, and this time of year tends to bring more pediatric physical injuries like broken bones from outdoor activities. "
health,"“We have many patients, many patients, every day,” Darnauer said. “We are back beyond our pre-pandemic volumes at LBJ.”"
health,"Propst advised everyone who can get vaccinated to do so, and said children should wear masks. More than 90% of people being admitted to Texas hospitals with COVID are unvaccinated. Since children under 12 cannot yet be vaccinated, masks are their best protection."
health,"Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R), meanwhile, has signed an executive order banning mask and vaccine mandates in the state."
health,"“If children are not masking in schools, it will be a major problem,” Propst warned."
health,"“Going forward, in Texas, there will not be any government-imposed shutdowns or mask mandates,” Abbott said Wednesday. “Everyone already knows what to do.”"
health,"At least one-third of the 1,600 patients in the county who were receiving care in the health care system Wednesday had COVID-19, The Associated Press reported. There are typically around 1,400 patients in the system at one time, Dr. Marc Napp, Memorial Healthcare System’s chief medical officer, said at a news conference Wednesday."
health,"The Texas Department of State Health Services reported more than 13,500 new confirmed and probable cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, with 8,130 reported hospitalizations — the highest number of hospitalizations since mid-February. The seven-day rolling average for hospitalizations was up roughly 50% statewide, officials reported Wednesday."
health,"A hospital chain in Florida’s Broward County, which includes Fort Lauderdale, currently has the “highest number of patients” it has ever seen."
health,"“This is the highest number of patients Memorial has ever seen,” he said."
health,"Napp added that it was not the highest number of COVID-19 patients the hospitals had seen at one time, with last summer still holding the record. "
health,"“However, the numbers are rising and it’s pretty sure that we’re going to surpass those numbers,” he said. “Our peak last summer was 600. We’re at 537 today.”"

health,The overwhelming influx of patients is forcing Memorial Healthcare to suspend all elective surgeries.
health,"Patients were in additional beds lined up in cafeterias and a conference center among the health care system’s six hospitals, officials said. And there is no sign that the skyrocketing trend of new cases of the delta variant of the disease was going to fall anytime soon. Some 97% of the COVID cases at Memorial are unvaccinated people."

So far, the FDA has only granted emergency-use approval of the Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Full approval is expected soon."
health,"United, which has 67,000 employees in the United States, is the first major U.S. airline to announce it will require vaccination for workers. The airline has been requiring vaccination of new hires since mid-June. Unvaccinated workers are required to wear face masks at company offices."
health,The Chicago-based airline estimates that up to 90% of its pilots and close to 80% of its flight attendants are already vaccinated. They get incentives to do so.
health,Company leaders called it a matter of safety and cited “incredibly compelling” evidence of the effectiveness of the vaccines.
health,"“We know some of you will disagree with this decision to require the vaccine for all United employees,” CEO Scott Kirby and President Brett Hart told employees Friday. But, they added, “the facts are crystal clear: everyone is safer when everyone is vaccinated.”"
health,"Each employee will have to send an image of their vaccine card to the company. Those who don’t will be terminated, with exemptions granted only for religious or health reasons, officials said."
health,"Employees who are already vaccinated or do so by Sept. 20 will get an extra day of pay, according to the memo from Kirby and Hart."
health,"Airlines and other companies in the travel business have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic, which led to sharp travel restrictions. The United States requires people entering the country, including U.S. citizens, to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test, and the Biden administration plans to require non-U.S. citizens to be vaccinated before entering the country."
health,"A United executive said the airline has no plans to require that passengers be vaccinated, calling that a government decision. The CEOs of Delta and American have similarly ruled out a mandate for passengers."
health,"Like United, Delta Air Lines has operated vaccination center for employees and recently began requiring the shots for new hires. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said this week that 73% of the airline’s workforce is vaccinated. Executives at other airlines have similarly encouraged their workers to get vaccinated, even offering bonuses and paid time off to get the shots, but haven’t made them mandatory."
health,"A few governments are getting involved. California and New York City will require employees to be vaccinated or face weekly testing, and the California mandate extends to workers in public and private hospitals and nursing homes."
health,"Microsoft, Google and Facebook have said they will require proof of vaccination for employees and visitors to their U.S. offices starting this fall."
health,"This week, Tyson Foods announced it will require all U.S. employees to get vaccinated by November — notable because unlike the tech companies, Tyson relies on many lower-paid workers who cannot do their jobs remotely. The president of the United Food and Commercial Workers criticized Tyson for imposing the requirement while the vaccines still have only emergency FDA approval."
health,"The new rules come as the U.S. struggles with a surge in infections driven by the highly contagious delta variant of COVID-19. The 7-day average of new reported coronavirus cases has jumped to more than 90,000 a day from around 12,000 a month ago, although hospitalizations and deaths have risen more slowly."
health,The White House announced Thursday that the review and recommendation site Yelp is debuting a new feature to let users search for businesses by their vaccination requirements.
health,"“Businesses know vaccinations are a way to keep their workers and customers safe and to keep their doors open,” Jeffrey Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said at a news conference. "
health,The new feature will allow users to search on Yelp’s website and mobile app for businesses with fully vaccinated workers and for those that require proof of vaccination to enter.
health,"“We support these vaccination requirements to protect workers, communities and the country,” Zients said."
health,A Yelp spokeswoman told HuffPost that the company will be “proactively monitoring Yelp pages of businesses that activate these attributes” in order “to help protect businesses that may experience backlash for their vaccination policies.”
health,"“The past year and a half has been like no other,” Yelp Vice President of User Operations Noorie Malik said in a statement. “Both business owners and consumers have expressed interest in Yelp releasing vaccine-related attributes. For many months we’ve seen businesses implement vaccine requirements for both their customers and staff. As a result, we’ve also seen a rise in reviews primarily focused on people’s stance on COVID vaccinations rather than their actual experience with the business.”"
health,"At Thursday’s news conference, the White House’s coronavirus response team highlighted increasing vaccination rates, particularly in those regions of the country where COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are spiking. "
health,"The picture of the rise of coronavirus cases is particularly grim for the American South. Over the past seven days, Florida and Texas have accounted for about one-third of new cases and more than one-third of new hospitalizations across the country. Seven states that make up just a quarter of the U.S. population ― Florida, Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi ― account for more than half of new cases and hospitalizations over the past week."
health,"The U.S. saw about 864,000 coronavirus vaccinations go into arms over “the past 24 hours,” according to Zients, who said that figure was the highest single-day total since July 3. The bulk of them ― or around 585,000 ― were first shots."
health,"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky told reporters that, despite the increased transmissibility of the delta variant, it still appears the overwhelming majority of severe illness is occurring in unvaccinated people. "
health,"In response to rising case counts, businesses, hospitals and educational institutions around the country have been announcing vaccination requirements for their staff, students and others. More than 100 hospital systems around the country are requiring employees to be vaccinated, and nearly 650 colleges and universities are requiring the same of on-campus staff and students, Zients said. Many leaders at the local, state and federal levels ― including President Joe Biden ― have said government workers under their purview will need to be vaccinated or regularly tested, as well."
health,"The American legal system has a history of protecting the right of localities and employers to mandate vaccinations, and the courts have so far upheld such requirements in the COVID-19 era. "
health,Exceptions are generally expected to be made for health or religious concerns. 
health,GENEVA (AP) — The head of the World Health Organization called Wednesday for a moratorium on administering booster shots of COVID-19 vaccines as a way to help ensure that doses are available in countries where few people have received their first shots.
health,"The U.N. health agency has repeatedly called for rich countries to do more to help improve access to vaccines in the developing world. It has argued that no one is safe until everyone is safe because the longer and more widely the coronavirus circulates, the greater the chance that new variants could emerge — and prolong a global crisis in fighting the pandemic."
health,WHO officials say the science is unproven about whether giving booster shots to people who have already received two vaccine doses is effective in preventing the spread of the coronavirus.
health,"WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus made the appeal mostly to wealthier countries that have far outpaced the developing world in numbers of vaccinations. He said richer countries have administered about 100 doses of coronavirus vaccines for every 100 people on average, while low-income countries — hampered by short supplies — have provided only about 1.5 doses per 100 people."
health,"The agency has no power to require countries to act, and many in the past have ignored its appeals on issues like donating vaccines, limiting cross-border travel and taking steps to boost production of vaccines in developing countries."
health,Tedros pointed to a WHO target he had announced in May seeking to ensure that 10% of the populations in all countries receive vaccines against the coronavirus.
health,"“Accordingly, WHO is calling for a moratorium on boosters until at least the end of September to enable at least 10% of the population of every country to be vaccinated,” he told a news conference."
health,"To help take the heat out of the pandemic, WHO has been focusing on getting vaccines to older adults, health care workers and other target populations in many countries before booster shot campaigns are carried out."
health,"Dr. Bruce Aylward, a special adviser to Tedros, said the moratorium was about an appeal to countries considering booster doses to “put a hold” on such policies “until and unless we get the rest of the world caught up” in the fight against the pandemic."
health,"”As we’ve seen from the emergence of variant after variant, we cannot get out of it unless the whole world gets out of it together. And with the huge disparity in vaccination coverage, we’re simply not going to be able to achieve that,” Aylward said."
health,"Israel, France, Germany and many Middle Eastern countries have already started administering boosters, and other nations, including the United States and Britain, are considering plans to do so in the wake of the emergence of the highly transmissible delta variant."
health,"Dr. Katherine O’Brien, WHO’s vaccines chief, noted that a “very limited number” of countries were giving booster doses though a larger number were contemplating it."
health,"“The evidence is evolving. It’s moving. We don’t have a full set of evidence around whether this is needed or not,” O’Brien said, adding that the main message was that “we need instead to focus on those people who are most vulnerable.”"
health,WHO officials reiterated their call for global “solidarity” to help battle the coronavirus pandemic and appealed to wealthy countries and corporations to help.
health,"“We call on everyone with influence ― Olympic athletes, investors, business leaders, faith leaders and every individual in their own family and community ― to support our call for a moratorium on booster shots until at least the end of September,” Tedros said."
health,The coronavirus pandemic has hit a new ― and bleak ― milestone.
health,"“We need everyone’s cooperation, especially the handful of countries and companies that control the global supply of vaccines,” Tedros said, appealing in particular to the influential Group of 20 large economies. “The G-20 has a vital leadership role to play as the countries that are the biggest producers, the biggest consumers and the biggest donors of COVID-19 vaccines.”"
health,"To date, more than 4.2 million people have died from the virus, a staggering figure that includes more than 614,000 Americans, 558,000 Brazilians and at least 425,000 people in India."
health,"He urged the G-20, which currently is chaired by Italy, to make “concrete commitments to support global vaccination targets.”"
health,"According to data released Monday by Johns Hopkins’ Coronavirus Resource Center, more than 200 million people have been infected with COVID-19 worldwide."
health,"It is important to remember that those figures are only the known accounts of infections and deaths associated with COVID-19. Various studies have estimated that the true toll of the pandemic is much higher in some areas. In India, for example, experts told The New York Times in May that the official death toll could be one-half, one-fifth or even less than one-tenth of the actual figure, which may never be known."
health,It took about 12 months for the coronavirus to infect the first 100 million people worldwide; the next 100 million were infected in just a six-month time frame.
health,"Although access to vaccines had alleviated a crush of infections in many rich nations, new cases have begun to skyrocket once again, mainly due to the highly transmissible delta variant infecting the unvaccinated."
health,"In the past month, every state in the U.S. has seen infections rise. According to White House pandemic response coordinator Jeff Zients, Texas and Florida accounted for a full one-third of all new cases nationwide last week. In Louisiana, where vaccination rates are low, public health officials warned this week that the state’s largest hospital was running out of beds, calling it the “darkest” time of pandemic thus far. "
health,"The Biden administration is working to combat ongoing hesitation among millions who have either refused or delayed getting a COVID-19 vaccination. More than 192 million Americans have received at least one vaccination dose and more than 165 million have been fully vaccinated. In the last week, an average of 677,000 doses per day was administered, a 10% increase over the week before, The Washington Post reported."
health,"Vaccines remain the best measure to prevent severe illness from COVID-19 or death associated with the disease, and Johns Hopkins noted that more than 4.2 billion doses of various inoculations have been delivered around the world. Many of those jabs, however, have been focused on developing nations that are now mulling booster shots for their residents, a measure that has caused alarm among some officials. "
health,"“I understand the concern of all governments to protect their people from the delta variant,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO’s director-general, said at a news briefing. “But we cannot — and we should not — accept countries that have already used most of the global supply of vaccines using even more of it, while the world’s most vulnerable people remain unprotected.”"
health,"The World Health Organization on Wednesday urged wealthier countries to hold off on administering booster jabs until the end of September, saying vaccines should be deployed in lower-income nations so they can vaccinate at least 10% of their populations. The New York Times reported that more than 80% of the vaccines delivered so far have been used in high- and upper-middle-income countries."
health,"There are a few reasons I’ve struggled to wash my dishes in a timely manner. I’m a recovering alcoholic, and in active addiction, I neglected a lot of the tasks of being human. After a nasty relapse that interrupted a nine-year period of sobriety, I had to call my mother to get on a plane and help me dig out of the mess I’d been living in. We did something like 15 loads of laundry; the clothes had been previously coating my bedroom floor in a pile several feet high. "
health,"I have had several sink issues over the years. Mostly flies. Fruit flies, drain flies, gnats ― it’s unclear what specific infestation of little winged creatures have taken over my sink area, but the cause was evident: the dirty dishes I’d left stacked there for weeks at a time. I once looked inside a pasta sauce-encrusted pot to see it teeming with wriggling white maggots, a detail so disgusting I hesitate to share it in publication."
health,"But even in sobriety, I have always had a hard time with domestic duties. I’m the poster child for adult attention deficit disorder, which I was finally diagnosed with at age 30, and let me tell you now that executive function comes in mighty handy when it comes to household maintenance. When I look at a messy room, my focus is pulled in 50 different directions. Where a neurotypical person might just start picking up trash or putting items back in their places, I get truly paralyzed by all the possible approaches and instead, half the time, do nothing."
health,"I also just don’t always see mess the same way a neurotypical person does. In past relationships, the trail of clutter or unnoticed drips and spills I left in my wake were a constant source of conflict. I didn’t know how to explain that it wasn’t that I was being lazy or careless ― it was that my brain functions differently. "
health,"I’m also a single mom to an almost-10-year-old and that means I’m always trying to do 15 things at once and to fit cleaning in between the more pressing matters of parenting. You can bet I clean that tub approximately five seconds before I’m putting that kid in it. Then I scrub the rest of the bathroom while he soaks. On a good day, anyway. "
health,"With the exception of perhaps the kitchen sink, nothing was the unsanitary kind of dirty. But that didn’t stop me from feeling a toxic, oozing shame about the mess. Despite understanding the unique challenges I face when it comes to domestic duties ― ADD, single parenting, lack of childhood modeling ― I always felt deep down that there was something fundamentally wrong with me that I couldn’t manage the way others seemed to, and that was a constant, underlying source of shame."
health,"Not only were we trapped in our cramped New York City apartment, that apartment was becoming less pleasant by the day. "
health,"When COVID hit and we were suddenly confined to our homes, my already iffy housekeeping skills took a hit. My son and I were suddenly generating more garbage, dirty dishes and clutter than ever. In my early efforts to excel at pandemic momming, ongoing Lego projects with hundreds of tiny pieces took over the living room floor and goopy science projects dripped everywhere. The laundromat shut down and our dirty clothes piled up. "
health,"Davis told me she developed her approach after becoming a stay-at-home mom when her second daughter was born three weeks before the pandemic lockdown. Without access to the family and child care resources and support she had intended to rely on, things began piling up around her and for the first time, her house “stopped functioning.” Eventually she was diagnosed with postpartum depression. "
health,"Then, I stumbled on the Instagram page for Struggle Care, a philosophy developed by licensed counselor KC Davis, to help people who struggle to complete what she calls “care tasks” because of functional barriers like mental health issues, neurodivergence like ADHD or autism, chronic pain or sickness, or temporary life stages like grief, postpartum, trauma, or being a caretaker to small children or another family member. "
health,"One day, while both kids were napping, she decided to clean up using an organizational method she’d developed for herself and she casually filmed it and put it on TikTok, suggesting it might be helpful to people who struggle with depression or ADHD or who have children and are overwhelmed with cleaning. The clip went viral and she started answering questions from followers, of which she now has more than a million. "
health,"“People would say, ‘This is so helpful, I have so much shame around this.’ And I would respond and say, ‘Well, there’s no reason to have shame. It’s not a moral failing to have a messy house.’ And that’s where kind of the first pillar of Struggle Care came from ― that care tasks are morally neutral,” she said. "
health,Reading these messages feels like exhaling a breath I didn’t know I was holding.
health,"A good mom is expected not only to be emotionally present and engaged in the work of parenting, but to keep a spotless home and put nutritious meals on the table as well. "
health,"And of course a lot of women have been soaking up these messages connecting our proficiency at care tasks with our value our whole lives. Davis points out that, societally, we have a concept for men who are good dads but not great at care tasks. “Sure, the kids are going to school with their shoes on backward but he’s a GOOD DAD.” Yet we don’t really have the same concept for women. "
health,"Although Davis shares some tips and strategies that help her, she’s not selling a method that teaches you how to clean your kitchen or how to fold your clothes. Instead, she’s providing a foundation of moral neutrality and self-compassion that allows you to then gently build skills and find the routines that work best for you. Only by treating yourself kindly can you find the motivation to perform the self-care tasks you’re struggling with. "
health,"It was at once a revelation and utterly simple. Because, of course, struggling to do my dishes doesn’t make me a bad person, or a bad mother. Dirty dishes don’t say anything about my character. So why have I been telling myself they do my whole adult life?"
health,"“I think it became a tool of the patriarchy to keep women in their place, to be honest,” said Davis. “If you made a clean home and home cooked meals, and all these sort of these care tasks, if you make them moral obligations, and you praise people that do them and shame people that don’t do them, well, you sort of lay out this achievement scale for women.”"
health,"In fact, this is the first message I stumbled upon on Struggle Care’s Instagram page ― an image of several household messes that reads “Mess isn’t moral.” The caption says: “Being messy isn’t a character failing. Struggling with care tasks happens to lots of adults for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes it’s as simple a hectic season of life. Sometimes mess even means good things about you. Dishes mean you fed yourself. Perhaps you prioritized more important things like relationships, career, or mental health and healing.”"
health,"But either way, one aspect of Davis’ approach rings true to me and that’s that “shame is the enemy of functioning.” Shaming yourself into doing your dishes works about as well as being shamed to lose weight, which is to say not at all, and in fact, the opposite result is usually achieved. "
health,"Another image reads, “It’s not failure, it’s laundry. Laundry is morally neutral.” Another: “Housework is not motherhood.”"
health,"Neither of us is saying it’s fine for kids to grow up in a toxic biohazard. The message isn’t that a safe, sanitary environment isn’t important. It’s just that a compassionate, shame-free approach to overcoming whatever issues are causing the problem is more likely to help than beating yourself up."
health,Davis said the videos that most often receive comments from followers who feel they’re finally able to start on a long-delayed care task are the videos about shame reduction and being kind to yourself. 
health,"“You deserve kindness regardless of your level of functioning,” she said. “The first and most important intervention of struggle care isn’t how do I get the dishes done or how do I complete care tasks. It’s starting to be kind to yourself right where you are.”"
health,"After decades of feeling like a failure or worrying that I was constantly falling short as a mom, that message was just what I needed to hear. I’m still working to keep my sink clean, but I’m also no longer telling myself I’m not good enough because it doesn’t come easily. "
health,"It’s obviously important to teach children responsibility, and I want my son to grow up having learned the domestic skills I didn’t. But I equally value his innate empathy and understanding."
health,"I want him to grow up treating himself with that same kindness when he falls short of perfection. And in the end, I think that’s more valuable than a spotless sink. "
health,"Once when I made a self-deprecating comment about my housekeeping, he responded like some kind of underage sage: “Well first of all, Mom, it’s a pandemic. And also you don’t have a boyfriend or a husband so you’re doing everything by yourself. So I think you’re doing a pretty good job.” It came naturally to him to treat me with a kindness I have never afforded myself on this topic. "

health,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is aiming to grant full approval to Pfizer-BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine by early next month, according to a New York Times report published Wednesday that cited unnamed people familiar with the decision-making process."
health,The FDA requires drug manufacturers to secure more data in order to obtain a biologics license instead of an emergency use authorization. 
health,"The Pfizer drug was the first in the country to be granted emergency use authorization from the FDA, which it received in early December. It filed for full approval ― called a biologics license application ― with the agency in early May."
health,"“Acknowledging the urgency related to the current state of the pandemic, we have taken an all-hands-on-deck approach, including identifying additional resources such as personnel and technological resources from across the agency and opportunities to reprioritize other activities, in order to complete our review to help combat this pandemic surge,” the agency said. It does not comment “on specific timing,” however. "
health,"Full approval is expected to encourage some vaccine-hesitant individuals to finally get inoculated against the coronavirus, which is presently surging in under-vaccinated regions across the country. Employers and other institutions in the U.S. have cited the emergency use authorization as a legal hurdle to issuing vaccine requirements, meaning the full authorization will likely spark more mandates."
health,"FDA leadership recognizes that “for some, the FDA approval of COVID-19 vaccines may bring additional confidence and encourage them to get vaccinated,” the agency said in a statement to HuffPost. "
health,Doctors and nurses are currently permitted to distribute the Pfizer vaccine to people ages 12 and up; the manufacturer previously said it plans to ask for emergency authorization to distribute the shots to kids ages 2 through 11 in September. 
health,"Moderna, whose COVID-19 vaccine was approved in December for people aged 18 and up, has also applied for full approval from the FDA and is giving the agency new data on a rolling basis. At the request of the FDA, both Pfizer and Moderna are working to expand their vaccine trials for children aged 5 to 11 in order to get a better picture of very rare side effects."
health,"The FDA announced earlier this summer that it planned to approve the Pfizer drug by January of next year, but the agency’s internal target date is Labor Day, the Times reported. The agency acknowledged previously that approval was likely to come sooner than 2022, but has provided scant public commentary on its timeline."
health,A Texas pediatrician has warned she is “more worried for children than I have ever been” as the virulent delta coronavirus strain takes hold across the country.
health,"
“What I do know is that in this moment, as the highly contagious delta variant becomes the predominant strain circulating and we enter another covid surge, I am more worried for children than I have ever been.”
The number of children contracting COVID-19 has increased significantly since the end of June, a new report from the American Academy of Pediatrics found. Multiple states have reported an upward trend in child hospitalizations amid the ongoing surge in new cases.
Vaccination rates in teens remain very low, and children under 12 are not yet eligible to receive a jab.
Due to the high transmissibility of the delta variant, Haq said, more children will be exposed to the virus than before, leading to more infections and, in turn, more hospitalizations.
“As school reopenings coincide with the growth of the delta variant, I worry we will see large outbreaks in school settings that we didn’t see with less-contagious versions of the virus,” Haq said.
She implored every eligible child and adult to seek out a vaccine and warned that it is still crucial to follow mitigation measures despite pandemic fatigue.
“Masking (including universal masking in schools), physical distancing, testing, contact tracing, quarantining and vaccinating do help,” she reminded readers. “If we abandon these crucial tools now, we are putting our children in harm’s way.”

health,"The Belarusian House in Ukraine, which helps Belarusians fleeing persecution with their legal status in Ukraine, accommodation and employment, also said that Shisov was recently being followed by strangers."
health,"Belarus was rocked by months of protests, which were triggered by President Alexander Lukashenko’s re-election to a sixth term in an August 2020 vote that the opposition and the West saw as rigged. He responded to demonstrations with a massive crackdown that saw more than 35,000 people arrested and thousands beaten by police"

But the board reversed itself after DeSantis signed an executive order preventing mask mandates in schools, and empowering the state to deny funding to any districts that don’t comply."
health,"The addition of 1,126 more COVID patients in Florida hospitals was announced amid a power struggle between Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and local officials over how to protect children and staff as the school year begins."
health,"Broward’s board had responded to the latest science on the virus, which suggests that while vaccinated people are extremely unlikely to be hospitalized or die from COVID-19, they can still spread infection among those who haven’t had their shots. This revelation prompted the CDC to recommend “universal indoor masking for all teachers, staff, students, and visitors to K-12 schools, regardless of vaccination status.”"

health,"People who die of COVID die the worst deaths imaginable. (I used to be a burn nurse, so please understand that when I say that it means something.) "
health,"I don’t think most Americans realized what it was they asked of nurses last year. It was easy to call us heroes, but far harder to understand what we were put through at the bedside. Nursing in COVID times, both then and now as it continues, is being forced to bear witness to a cavalcade of preventable tragedy."
health,"Most Americans will never understand what it is like to look someone in the eyes as they pant in increasing terror, forced to choose between talking on the phone to a loved one they know they might never see again and breathing enough to survive. To hear their distant loved ones shrieking over FaceTime, trying to tell your patient that they love them as they die."
health,"How would you feel if you were forced to watch this every day for up to 16 hours? Every single shift of yours, over the course of an entire year? "
health,***
health,There’s a certain amount of braggadocio in health care. 
health,"Because the consequences of any of our mistakes can be so dire, many of us have a hard time admitting that we have ever made any. And thus, because we want to think ourselves infallible, it is often hard to recognize the signs when we are not. "
health,"When we go home, unable to stop thinking about what happened on a certain shift. "
health,When we have trouble regulating our emotions because for so long to have even acknowledged their mere existence would have been the difference between functioning another day versus ceaseless weeping.

health,"I cracked at work in late April, in the middle of a shift."
health,"I told my closest friends I wanted to die, started crying, and didn’t stop for about three weeks. I wound up being placed on temporary leave and diagnosed with PTSD. "
health,"But I actually think that’s what triggered it. The fact that, for the first time in 13 months, I had a chance to breathe."
health,To rest.
health,To reflect.
health,"And when I looked back at what I had “accomplished” last year as a COVID ICU nurse, which was mostly nothing, through no fault of my own, I couldn’t bear it. Being forced to witness so many absolutely needless deaths, hearing so many family’s hopes dashed on the phone, and listening to people at the highest levels of government lie without consequence?"
health,"I had given my all, for a whole year, and I’m used to succeeding, dammit. "
health,"And yet for most of 2020, and the beginning of 2021, I couldn’t. "
health,No matter how hard I tried. 
health,And it broke me. 
health,"It is frustrating, though. When someone is physically ill, you have metrics to judge their progress with ― have they recovered mobility, are their labs now good? But when you’re newly mentally ill, while you can hold up the image of the person that you used to be, there comes a time when you realize that you might not get that person back. "
health,"I am still working on coming back. I’ve come to accept that recovering and keeping my mental health is not something I can count on, but instead a lifelong goal. "
health,I so dearly want to go back to the time when I thought that my government was invested in the health of its citizens ― and when those citizens themselves seemed to care about one another.

health,"If someone came to your house and told you to take all the batteries out of your fire alarms, you’d report them to someone, right? Because that’s literally insane. We all know that fire alarms save lives, no questions asked."
health,So why do we tolerate anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists moving among us? Or any political figure that decries wearing a little scrap of fabric on their face because of “freedoms!”?
health,Each of us is being forced to be a handmaiden to atrocity.
health,"Knowing what we do about COVID now, how quickly it transmits, and how lethal it can be, allowing either of these groups any foothold in American society is the same level of insanity as someone who sabotages fire alarms on purpose. "
health,"Every nurse in America right now is staring down this summer and this fall like it’s the barrel of a gun. All of our hospitals are seeing COVID cases rise again, and with the rare exception of immunologically compromised patients for whom the vaccines are less effective, none of these deaths had to happen. "
health,And ... for what?
health,Why?
health,"I mean it, really."
health,Why?
health,"If you tell me it’s because “God knows when it’s your time,” I just want to tell you from the bedside, none of my patients looked peaceful dying, nor did their families find one whit of comfort in their deaths. "

health,"I know this essay’s going to piss some people off, and I know I don’t 100% speak for all nurses."
health,"But if it does piss you off, know this ― the real emotion you should be feeling right now is shame. "
health,***
health,"Because for some soulless reason you are OK with wanton, needless carnage. You are OK with people dying. There is no in between."
health,To be a good nurse you by definition have to care ― and truly caring requires making oneself vulnerable.

health,"One evening, when I was 13, my dad asked me if I wanted to go on a run. "
health,"I had never gone on a run before, but I figured if my dad could do it, I could, too. Dogs barked as we made our way down country roads. The setting sun was making the fields and trees golden and the path seemed to have no end … and I didn’t want it to. I felt like my whole world was opening up. "
health,"After that, I started running with my dad more often. Neither of us was any good, but never once did my dad stress about the time on the clock. We just went out and enjoyed ourselves. "
health,"My mom said she wasn’t surprised that I loved to run because once when I was 3, she took my brothers and me down to a park that had a track and I kept running loops nonstop. She said it seemed like I was born to do it. "
health,"Unfortunately, at age 15, everything came crumbling down while the innocence of childhood waned and mental illness crept in. I became anorexic in the ninth grade and all of my ideas about who I was in this world felt meaningless in comparison to my one and only goal of disappearing. "
health,"During that year I had an exercise addiction in addition to eating almost nothing, and my love of running turned into just another ritualistic task that had to be performed."
health,"As often happens in anorexia without proper treatment, I reached a point where my body couldn’t function any longer at max capacity as I starved. I began eating everything in sight and quickly entered into 10 years of my own personal hell: severe bulimia that distorted my view of reality even further. I had a hard time enjoying running anymore as my electrolyte levels would leave me disoriented, and I often felt depressed. "
health,I joined a running group to try and keep myself connected with the world and out of my binges and purges that happened five to 10 times per day. I was always anxious to get home and be alone with my bulimia again. It was the demon I couldn’t escape and ultimately landed me in an in-patient treatment program that saved my life. 
health,I was dedicated to my recovery plan and desperate for new behaviors. I viewed my time in the hospital as my one chance to get my life back.
health,"After successfully completing and exiting the program, I continued following the guided recommendations precisely: three meals, two snacks. No exceptions. But there was another rule during treatment: no exercise. I was confused about my relationship with running and whether it was OK for me to do it again. I knew I wanted to run. I felt healthy and strong for the first time in over a decade. "
health,"I was in group therapy still at the time and consulted the therapist. She said that if running brought me joy, by all means, I should do it. So, I did. A year of group therapy later, I started off on my own, confident that I could sustain my recovery without a hand to hold."
health,"Four years of healthy behaviors and casual running later, the manic energy that had been part of my mental illness started screaming at me. I found myself wanting to isolate and engage in behaviors I knew would destroy my life again. Then, I had a thought. What if I could channel this manic feeling away from destructive behavior patterns and into some faster running?"
health,"I had never done a speed workout before and was a slow runner. In fact, up until this moment, I had always held the belief that this is who I was: Vanessa the untalented runner. But like a lot of other false beliefs I held about myself and deconstructed in treatment (Vanessa the worthless failure … Vanessa the disappointment), I thought it was time to challenge this one the way I was taught to push back on the others."
health,"I was curious about what it would take to qualify for the Boston Marathon, so I looked up a training plan online. The previous 26.2 I had attempted had taken me over five hours. Boston was asking for a 3:35. I decided to go for it."
health,"I completed the first workout without dying. Then the next. Then the next. Every day for four months, I was able to sustain a healthy mental state as my manic energy was transmitted to running hard in the mornings and maintaining physical wellness and proper nutrition through each day."
health,I woke up at 4 a.m. to run on the first day of training. It felt like magic. It was the moment in a movie when the protagonist has a grand epiphany that the trajectory of her life is about to catapult her into something great and unknown.
health,"Though on the surface my training was for the Boston marathon, it was truly a self-appointed prescription to ride out manic/depressive urges and be able to function well in regular life by doing the thing that I loved."
health,Achieving the goal in a four-month time period after breaking down my narrative of “Vanessa the untalented runner” felt like an awakening. I was rediscovering who I believe I was created to be.
health,"I kept this dream to myself as I continued to train harder. Qualifying for the Boston Marathon is usually the level of bragging rights a mere mortal achieves, with the next ultimate achievement, Olympic trials, being comically out of reach. "
health,I started paying attention to professional female athletes in the marathon field. I secretly began to wonder if I had what it took to someday qualify for the Olympic marathon trials. 
health,"Qualifying for the Olympic trials in the marathon requires a time of 2:45 (women) or 2:19 (men). There are several marathons in the U.S., open to anyone that registers, that are qualifying races. Marathon running is one of the only sports where the average person is lined up with a field of professionals in the same race."
health,"I decided not to pour any money into the endeavor other than my sneakers, which I have had to switch out every two months because of the unprecedented mileage I put on them. All I had was manic energy, a love of running, and a self-modified training plan that I found when I Googled “Marathon training.” "
health,"Since then, I have done all my hard workouts on a treadmill in my garage for precise pacing and without any music — to maintain the mental fortitude required for things like eight one-mile repeats at a pace of 5:39/mile. Besides, runners that are trying to qualify for the Olympic marathon trials are not allowed to have any music during the race. If you are caught with earbuds, even if you meet the standard, it’s an automatic disqualification."
health,"After a year, I placed second in a half marathon race. Two years later, I am now averaging over 100 miles per week of running, am self-coached, and plan to achieve a qualifying time for the Olympic trials by 2022 and compete in Atlanta against the top women in the marathon in 2024. I have gone through two training cycles that indicate I am on target to achieve this dream. "
health,Why is the qualifying window for trials so large? I like to think it’s for women just like me who want to push toward the seemingly impossible to find out what they are capable of.
health,"The truth is, I won’t become an Olympian. The real elites are achieving times of sub-2:30. They are machines. Most have been groomed for greatness since their teen years. "
health,"Besides, my Olympic trials dream has very little to do with becoming one of the top female runners in the U.S. After losing myself to mental illness for well over a decade, it has been my guiding light back to who I was meant to be. I have healed on trails in the dark hours of the morning. As the sun rises, the darkness of my mind dissipates."
health,"My mind is no longer consumed or trapped when I am with loved ones. Whatever part of myself that is gets poured out of me like a fountain with each step toward my dream. I am that 3-year-old girl once again, joyfully running circles on the track. I am, beyond a shadow of a doubt, born to run. "

health,"Louisiana restored its statewide indoor mask mandate on Monday amid a dramatic surge in COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations, with the governor saying the state was in the worst phase of the pandemic thus far. "
health,"The mask mandate will apply to all people age 5 and older in indoor public places, regardless of vaccination status, and will remain in place until at least Sept. 1."
health,"Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) said the reinstated rules will go into effect on Wednesday, a move that emphasizes the growing threat of the delta strain of the coronavirus, a highly transmissible variant that has dampened the hopes of a return to normal nationwide. "
health,"“This is bad. And it’s not this bad anywhere else in the country today,” Bel Edwards said during a news briefing. “It has become extremely clear that our current recommendations on their own are not strong enough to deal with Louisiana’s fourth surge of COVID. In fact, nobody should be laboring under the misapprehension that this just another surge. This is the worst one we’ve had.”"
health,"The governor had lifted the state’s mask order in April, but left open the door to reinstate social distancing guidelines should the pandemic intensify. On Monday, he pointed to statistics that show just that: Louisiana has the most new coronavirus cases per capita in the United States and the chief medical officer of the state’s largest hospital said there were “no more beds left.”"
health,"“When you come inside our walls, it is quite obvious to you that these are the darkest days of this pandemic,” Dr. Catherine O’Neal, who runs Our Lady of the Lake Hospital in Baton Rouge, said Monday. She said COVID-19 hospitalizations had risen from 36 to 155 at her facility in two weeks and now occupy around a quarter of the hospital’s total number of beds."
health,"“We are no longer giving adequate care to these patients,” she added. “That has also stopped.”"
health,"O’Neal went on to say that vaccination remained one of the most effective tools to prevent severe cases of COVID-19 that led to hospitalization or death, echoing the nation’s top public health officials that have urged Americans to get jabbed. More than 70% of adults in the U.S. have had at least one shot but rates are lagging in many areas, prompting renewed concern about the surge in cases. "
health,"Louisiana has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country. Only 43% of residents have had at least one dose of a vaccine, and only 37% are fully inoculated. Bel Edwards said those figures would have to dramatically shift to help the state lift itself out of those dark days."
health,"“We have the tools we need to slow the spread of COVID-19 in our communities and save lives, and I am pleading with unvaccinated Louisianans to get their shot as soon as they can to protect themselves,” the governor said. “We can end this nightmare, but it is going to take all of us working together to do it.”"

health,"“I am not sure how writing jokes about organ transplants for television shows has become a thing but sadly it has apparently,” she wrote, adding that she hoped writers who proposed such material in the future would be “called out immediately.”"
health,"Gomez was responding to a recent episode of the Paramount+ series “The Good Fight,” which included a mention of her kidney transplant in a broader discussion about “cancel culture.”"
health,The scene in question showed characters Jay (played by Nyambi Nyambi) andJim (Ifádansi Rashad) brainstorming comedy ideas for a television executive (Wayne Brady).
health,"After Jay wonders aloud which topics would be considered taboo, Jim responds, “Selena Gomez’s kidney transplant.”"
health,"Gomez fans, or “Selenators,” expressed their distaste for the scene on social media this week, causing the phrase “RESPECT SELENA GOMEZ” to trend on Twitter late Monday and early Tuesday."
health,"“This woman deserves all the love and happiness, it’s so sad how people use a hurtful moment for her just for nasty jokes, put some respect on her name,” one person wrote. Another wondered: “How miserable do you have to be to take someone’s trauma/illness/struggles and use them for jokes, like just be a decent human being.”"
health,"On Tuesday, Gomez thanked her fans in a follow-up tweet, and encouraged them to register as organ donors. "
health,"When contacted by HuffPost on Tuesday, representatives for “The Good Fight” did not comment on the matter."
health,"Days later, NBC representatives issued a formal apology and removed the scene from the episode on the streaming platform. "
health,"Gomez, who turned 29 last month, underwent a kidney transplant in 2017. At the time, she said the transplant was “what I needed to do for my overall health” as a result of having lupus, an autoimmune disease that can cause damage to many organs. "
health,"“The Good Fight” is the second major series to catch heat for alluding to Gomez’s transplant. A 2020 episode of Peacock’s “Saved by the Bell” revival received heavy criticism for a scene in which in which two characters argue over who donated their kidney to Gomez, with Demi Lovato and “Justin Bieber’s mom” among the suggested donors."
health,"Nearly 72,000 children across the United States were confirmed to have COVID-19 in one week last month, according to an analysis from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association."
health,"However, the report advocated for caution, stating that there is “an urgent need to collect more data on longer-term impacts of the pandemic on children, including ways the virus may harm the long-term physical health of infected children,” along with their mental health."
health,"Children represented 19% of all newly recorded cases for the week ending July 29. The two groups called it “a substantial increase” from the week prior, when about 39,000 child cases were recorded."
health,"At least 4.2 million U.S. children have contracted the virus since the beginning of the pandemic, the organizations say in their new report. In total, there have been about 35.2 million recorded cases across the nation, although the true total is believed to be higher."
health,"The good news is that children are still very rarely dying of the coronavirus or experiencing severe symptoms, which commonly include difficulty breathing and fatigue. Children and teens are much less likely to require hospitalization; the report found that only 0.1% to 1.9% of all cases in minors have involved a hospital stay. Mortality rates are similarly low — of all the people who have died of COVID-19 in the U.S., only up to 0.03% were children. "
health,"Public health experts maintain that the surest way out of the coronavirus crisis is through widespread vaccination. Amid a surge in cases driven by the more contagious delta variant, the U.S. this week finally reached President Joe Biden’s goal of 70% of American adults having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine."
health,"Anecdotal reports from doctors on the front lines of the COVID-19 response suspect the delta variant is more harmful to young adults ― people in their 20s and 30s ― than the original variants that circulated in 2020, but data is lacking."
health,"When viruses are allowed to spread unchecked throughout a population, it gives them more opportunity to mutate into versions that could be more harmful. "
health,The New York Times reported Wednesday that the Food and Drug Administration planned to fully approve the Pfizer vaccine by early September. The fact that the agency has only granted emergency use authorization to the available vaccines is commonly cited as one potential reason for low vaccination rates in parts of the U.S. 
health,"While all my friends were checking their phones, eagerly awaiting their invitations to get a COVID-19 vaccine, I was desperately looking for ways to get out of it."
health,"No, I’m not anti-vaccine, nor am I “vaccine-hesitant.” I’m part of a less publicized group: the needle-phobics."
health,"I have trypanophobia, the extreme fear of medical procedures involving injections, which means I’m terrified of needles and do everything in my power to avoid them."
health,"When I finally got my text, I stared at it with horror. Despite the overall success of the United Kingdom’s vaccine rollout, it has still taken half a year to give every adult access to their first shot, with doses being offered based on age (from oldest to youngest). Seventy percent of the U.K. population has now received at least one dose, according to data from The Financial Times; for comparison, 57% of the U.S. population has gotten at least one dose of a vaccine."
health,"I’m 24, so I was at the back of the line for the jab. I had spent the last six months telling myself my fear wasn’t hurting anyone because the vaccine rollout hadn’t reached me yet. I relished the knowledge that it was out of my control."
health,"But now that I had received my notification, not getting a vaccine would be my choice, and I faced the prospect of willingly putting myself ― and others ― at risk because of my trypanophobia."
health,"I hastily deleted the text, turned off my phone and hid it in my bedroom. I was about to start work for the day and didn’t have time to worry about what I’d do."
health,"“I’ll deal with it later,” I promised myself."
health,"If someone even mentions injections, I reflexively cover my arm with my hand. I’ve never successfully had a vaccine without fainting, and when I was 18, I screamed and cried through every blood test I underwent. My mum says she has never gotten over her embarrassment from that incident. "
health,"I’ve never “liked” needles, but my phobia developed after receiving my first vaccine when I was 14."
health,"That vaccine was to guard against HPV, a virus that can lead to cervical cancer, and it’s given to teenage girls at high schools across the U.K. every year. When I received it, I fainted for the first time in my life about 10 minutes after it was administered (I was told it may have been due to my blood pressure rising and then quickly falling in response to the vaccine) and injured myself in the process. The injection also hurt a lot more than I’d expected, and the scratching sensation made my stomach turn."
health,"I am not alone in being at the mercy of this paradox. Up to 1 in 10 people are so scared of needles, they might put off important medical treatments to avoid them, according to the charity Anxiety U.K. Is that irrational? Of course, but that is the nature of phobias. "
health,"So, even though I sincerely wanted a viable vaccine to be created and available, the minute I learned one was going into production, I was petrified."
health,"Some public figures have also shared similar fears. In March, Charles Walker, a Conservative member of Parliament, refused to receive a vaccine because of his extreme aversion to needles. Walker said he would get it once alternative methods of vaccine administration, such as a nasal spray, are approved."
health,"That would have been a good moment for the U.K.’s National Health Service or the government to acknowledge ― and tackle ― the threat that needle phobia poses to the vaccine rollout. I’m surprised there has been so little coverage of this issue, particularly given all the airtime afforded to people who are anti-vaccine. "
health,"But even if the NHS wasn’t addressing this issue, I certainly was. I vowed to find a way to deal with it and I sent inquiries to several cognitive behavioral therapy clinics (of which there are few) to get some help."
health,"In Brentwood, Essex, for instance, trypanophobics can sign up for virtual reality sessions to help them prepare for injections, but if you aren’t registered as a patient at a medical practice in that area (I’m not), you can’t benefit from it. That meant counseling was my best option. "
health,"I applied for counseling and then I waited ... and waited. I finally got an email informing me that I could not get an appointment for four months. Four months? It had already been six weeks since I got the text stating I was eligible for a vaccine, and my guilt over not going yet was rising."
health,"It was then that my dad asked me to get the jab. He was very ill with cancer at the time, and we were sitting on the sofa at his house when he just came right out and asked if I had been vaccinated."
health,I admitted I had not.
health,"“Please get it,” he said. “I worry about you.”"
health,"If I inherited my fear of needles from anyone, it’s him. But if anyone has shown courage in the face of fear, it’s also him. When he was diagnosed with cancer last October, needles became a regular part of his life."
health,"Thinking about his bravery put my fear of having to contend with a single needle one time into perspective. So, that was that. I booked my appointment, which was set to take place in four days."
health,"At first, I felt calm and confident."
health,"“It’s just a scratch,” I told myself, repeating what others had already reminded me. But as the appointment crept closer, my usual symptoms set in. I couldn’t eat or sleep, and I started panicking."
health,"I talked to my mum about my phobia, but she doesn’t really understand it. However, she has fears of her own, like thalassophobia ― the fear of open water. I told her to imagine being dropped into the middle of the ocean, and when I put it like that, she was able to empathize with what I was going through."
health,"On the day of my appointment, Mum drove me to the vaccination center and insisted that she be allowed to hold my hand the whole time. Luckily, it wasn’t very busy, so the staff was happy to allow her to accompany and support me."
health,"Before we entered the center, she covered my eyes with a face mask so I wouldn’t see any needles. She asked the staff not to talk about the injection with me, and reminded them not to tell me when they were about to deliver the shot so that I wouldn’t tense up. In her own words, she said it would be “harder and more painful to get the needle into a muscle thicker than a cold block of butter.” "
health,"At this point, I must pay tribute to the nurses who reassured me and helped me stay calm. I was guided by hand through the center while they outlined the potential side effects. Then they let me lie down. Mum was right there the whole time."
health,"When it was time for the vaccination, I felt the needle go in and, despite what anyone claims, it hurt like heck. The injection seemed to go on and on, and I swear I could still feel the needle in my skin long after the nurse said it had been removed. I felt sick to my stomach, but then my heart rate started to slow, the nausea subsided and the relief began to creep in."
health,"When it was over, the nurses made me feel like the bravest person in the world. Having convinced myself that my fear would be treated as a nuisance, I was surprised and touched to find the volunteers were practically tripping over each other to support me."
health,"I still hate needles. I realize now that everyone who’d told me beforehand that they had barely felt their jabs was lying (or they have a much different pain threshold than I do), though I can totally see why. I also fainted in the garden center a few hours after my COVID-19 vaccination (we still aren’t sure why the reaction was so delayed), so my record remains intact on that one. "
health,"That said, I’m so relieved I got it. Had I known just how brilliant the nurses would be, I would’ve gone sooner. And now I don’t feel quite so nervous about my second appointment."
health,"The one thing that will really stick with me is that after my injection was over, one of the nurses said they would rather people arrive scared and in need of help than choose to swerve their vaccination.I think that’s important for us all to remember."
health,"Shaming those people who are scared of needles is not going to get them running to vaccine centers. If anything, it might encourage them to lie about having received a shot, which won’t help any of us."
health,"I understand that rolling out vaccines on a national level is a huge task for any country, and some people might think accommodating needle-phobics is annoying or simply too much work. But really, all we need is some tangible support, like hand-holding and maybe a blindfold. A little kindness won’t hurt either. All in all, if that helps more people get vaccinated, that doesn’t seem like such a heavy lift, does it?"
health,"I’ll be returning for my second dose of the vaccine in a few weeks, and while I wouldn’t say I’m looking forward to the jab, I am looking forward to being fully vaccinated. I’m also hoping to carry my bravery forward and look into that counseling for my phobia."

health,"Federal health data released Saturday showed that Florida reported 21,683 new cases of COVID-19, the state’s highest one-day total since the start of the pandemic. The latest numbers were recorded on Friday and released on Saturday on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website. The figures show how quickly the number of cases is rising in the Sunshine State: only a day earlier, Florida reported 17,093 new daily cases."
health,"Florida is now leading the nation in per capita hospitalizations for COVID-19, as hospitals around the state report having to put emergency room visitors in beds in hallways and others document a noticeable drop in the age of patients."
health,"ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — A day after it recorded the most new daily cases since the start of the pandemic, Florida on Sunday broke a previous record for current hospitalizations, as the number of patients in hospitals because of COVID-19 once again broke through the 10,000-person threshold."
health,"The hospitalizations and increasing cases have come as the new, more transmittable delta variant has spread throughout Florida, and residents have returned to pre-pandemic activities."
health,"Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has resisted mandatory mask mandates and vaccine requirements, and along with the state Legislature, has limited local officials’ ability to impose restrictions meant to stop the spread of COVID-19. DeSantis on Friday barred school districts from requiring students to wear masks when classes resume next month."
health,"Florida’s Democratic agriculture commissioner, Nikki Fried, who is seeking to run against DeSantis for governor, on Sunday urged unvaccinated Floridians to get the shots. She said she was heartened by a recent uptick in vaccinations in the state."
health,"“We are already behind the curve and in a worse spot every time the numbers come out,” Fried said at a news conference in Tallahassee. “This surge is and will impact every single one of us.”"
health,"Barry Burton, the Pinellas County administrator, told the Tampa Bay Times that some local hospitals are already having to divert ambulances to different locations because of capacity concerns."

health,"Throughout Florida, from Jacksonville to Miami to Tampa, hospitals have become overwhelmed."
health,"Memorial Health’s Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital in Hollywood had seven patients with COVID-19. At Nicklaus Children’s Hospital in Miami, there were 17 patients with COVID-19 on Friday, including six in the ICU and one who needed a ventilator, Dr. Marcos Mestre, vice president and chief medical officer, told the Miami Herald."
health,"About half of the patients were under 12, Mestre said, and the rest were older and eligible for the vaccine. But none of the patients with COVID-19 at Nicklaus Children’s on Friday were vaccinated. Most children who get COVID-19 do not need hospitalization, Mestre said."
health,"For many hospital workers, up until a month ago, it looked like there was light at the end of the tunnel, as people got vaccinated and hospitalizations decreased. But then the summer surge, powered by the new delta variant, hit Florida in July."
health,"At the UF Health North hospital emergency room in Jacksonville, COVID-19 patients once again were being put in beds in hallways due to a surge in visits."
health,"“That light did turn out to be a train in this case,” Marsha Tittle, a nursing manager at UF Health North, told The Florida Times Union. “We’re taking more patients than we normally would take. ... My staff is wonderful. You walk out there, they’re going to have smiles on their faces and they’re doing a great job. But there’s a sense of defeat, like they’re just defeated.”"
health,"With coronavirus cases continually rising and millions of Americans remaining unvaccinated, Dr. Anthony Fauci on Sunday said he expects “things are going to get worse” in the U.S., while stopping short of predicting future lockdowns."
health,"Fauci, who serves as President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, pointed to cases consistently rising since late June for his dread."
health,"“We’re looking not, I believe, to lockdown but we’re looking to some pain and suffering in the future because we’re seeing the cases go up, which is the reason why we keep saying over and over again: The solution to this is get vaccinated and this would not be happening,” he said in an interview with ABC News’ “This Week.”"
health,"Back on June 19, the U.S. had a seven-day average of 11,473 new cases. The number is now more than six times that, with an average of 72,493 cases reported on Friday, according to data shared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
health,"Fauci stressed those who are unvaccinated are fueling the outbreak, as they’re predominantly responsible for the virus’s spread."
health,"“We have 100 million people in this country who are eligible to be vaccinated, who are not getting vaccinated,” he said. Just less than half of the U.S. is fully vaccinated, according to the CDC."
health,"While there’s a greater direct safety risk to the unvaccinated, Fauci stressed that not getting vaccinated ultimately impacts everyone, from the standpoint of everyone having to wear masks in public and inside schools and of businesses not resuming to normal. Those choosing not to get vaccinated also risk spreading the coronavirus to someone who is unable to get vaccinated due to health reasons."
health,"“There are some breakthrough infections among vaccinated ― we expect that because no vaccine is 100% effective ― but in the breakthrough infections they are mostly mild or without symptoms,” he said. “Whereas the unvaccinated, who have a much, much, much greater chance of getting infected in the first place, are the ones that are vulnerable to getting severe illness that may lead to hospitalization, and in some cases death.”"
health,"“When you look at the country as a whole and getting us back to normal, the unvaccinated, by not being vaccinated, are allowing the propagation and the spread of the outbreak, which ultimately impacts everyone,” he said."

health,So Stefanik either failed that essay question back at Harvard or simply ignored facts in order to own those dang liberals.
health,"Although Stefanik clearly wanted her tweet to own those dang liberals, there was a big problem: Medicare and Medicaid (as well as Social Security) ― which Stefanik supports ― are all government programs that fit the basic definition of socialism."
health,"HuffPost reached out to the congresswoman’s office, but no one immediately responded."
health,Stefanik was also dragged by conservatives for the clueless tweet.
health,"However, many Twitter users were happy to school Stefanik on her apparent lack of knowledge of what socialism is and isn’t."
health,OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — The Oklahoma Republican Party faced fierce criticism on Friday for a Facebook post likening COVID-19 vaccine mandates to the persecution of Jewish people in Nazi Germany.
health,"But Stefanik’s tweet did get support from an unlikely source: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), who offered advice on the best way to “own the socialists.”"
health,"Roberta Clark, executive director of the Jewish Federation of Greater Oklahoma City, called the post “highly inappropriate” and urged party officials to apologize."
health,The post on the party’s official Facebook page urged people to call the lieutenant governor and ask him to call a special session to prohibit employers from requiring their employees to get vaccinated. It featured a picture of a yellow Star of David with the word “unvaccinated” on it and said: “Those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it.”
health,"“To compare the actions taken by Nazi Germany to a public health discussion is ill-informed and inappropriate,” Clark said. “An apology is really appropriate, and it shows leadership and sensitivity to the harmful impact this has made.”"
health,"John Bennett, the party’s new chairman, didn’t immediately respond to a phone message left at the party’s headquarters seeking comment."
health,"It’s not the first time the state party, or Bennett, has faced criticism for posts on Facebook."
health,"Last month, Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of Georgia, apologized for comments she made comparing the required wearing of safety masks in the House to the horrors of the Holocaust."
health,"In 2015, then-Oklahoma Republican Party Chairman Randy Brogdon apologized for a post that likened food stamps to feeding wild animals."
health,"The following year, Bennett, then a state lawmaker, posted a news story on Facebook critical of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and added the comment, “2 words ... firing squad.”"
health,"At the time, Bennett defended the comments as “sarcasm,” and said he wouldn’t wish death upon anyone or encourage violence toward any candidate."
health,Some children have been sent out of state to other hospitals because of a lack of beds in Oklahoma.
health,"Oklahoma is running out of desperately needed pediatric hospital beds throughout the state amid rising COVID-19 cases, a surge in a separate serious respiratory illness and nursing shortages."
health,"“There have been a few pediatric patients who have needed ICU beds that there were no beds here. Any other couple of ICUs ... in the state that could take care of that sick of patients were also full, and we have had to send them out of state,” Dr. Cameron Mantor, chief medical officer at Oklahoma Children’s Hospital, told local Fox News 25."
health,"The Owasso Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine clinic issued a statement Wednesday warning that there were no pediatric ICU beds available anywhere in the state — among the hardest-hit in the current coronavirus wave — and that some patients were being sent to Texas. A few state beds became available later in the day, the clinic noted."
health,The center emphasized that the problem wasn’t only the coronavirus and its dangerous new delta variant. The state is also experiencing a rise in respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV) among children. But the clinic strongly encouraged COVID-19 vaccinations for everyone over the age of 12 to ease the hospital crush.
health,"“The point is you can take a vaccine to prevent possible COVID hospitalization but not for many other things,” said the statement on the clinic’s Facebook page. “We are just asking everyone to do what they can to help a strained hospital situation ... Please take the delta strain seriously.”"
health,"The delta variant of the virus appears to be impacting more children, and more significantly. The number of new COVID-19 cases the state reported in people 17 and under jumped to more than 1,400 this week — up from 820 last week."
health,"“It is the perfect storm, and we can prevent this,” Dr. Mary Clarke, head of the Oklahoma State Medical Association, said of the overwhelmed hospitals."
health,"The Oklahoma State Department of Health reported a total of 1,777 new COVID-19 cases on Friday for all ages, with both hospitalizations and deaths on the rise."
health,"She told Fox that her small Stillwater Medical Center had a total of five COVID-19 patients last Friday, 11 on Monday, 16 on Tuesday and 18 on Wednesday."
health,"“We have high bed numbers on top of increased COVID, primarily delta. And that is stressing everyone to capacity,” she said."
health,Clarke said the only immediate action to take to keep a dire situation from getting worse is to vaccinate people against COVID-19.
health,"The state’s doctors have complained about the lack of support from GOP Gov. Kevin Stitt amid the ongoing crisis. He was one of the last governors to implement COVID-19 safety restrictions and among the first to lift them this year. “We respect people’s rights ... to not wear a mask,” Stitt said a year ago. “You just open up a big can of worms.”"
health,"In a Facebook post on Friday, the state Republican Party compared vaccine mandates to the persecution of the Jews by Nazi Germany."
health,"“We’re pretty disappointed we’re not on the same page, that we can’t come together and have the same voice,” said Clarke."
health,Israel has become the first nation in the world to provide a third shot of the Pfizer vaccine to people over 60 because of concerns about breakthrough cases of COVID-19 among the fully vaccinated.
health,"The move will make the nation a test case for the effectiveness of a booster shot against the raging delta variant. Israeli President Isaac Herzog, 60,received his third shot on Friday and urged others to follow his example. The third shot will only be given to those who had their second shot at least five months earlier."
health,"Israel’s COVID-19 cases have soared from some 20 daily cases last month to more than 2,000 a day currently, though hospitalizations and deaths have remained relatively low."
health,Experts continue to emphasize that vaccinations are the most effective weapon against COVID-19. A British study published last week found that the Pfizer vaccine remained 88% effective against symptomatic cases of the delta variant.
health,Israel has reported some of the most troubling data about the effectiveness of vaccines against the delta variant and over time. The nation has a unique vantage point because it was the first in the world to launch an aggressive vaccination program — in mid-December. Its experiences could well predict what other nations may soon see.
health,"
While “preliminary” figures from Israel’s Health Ministry last week showed that the Pfizer vaccine was 91% effective against severe cases of COVID-19 and 88% effective against hospitalization from June 20 to July 17, it was reportedly only 39% effective in warding off all COVID-19 infections and 40% effective against symptomatic cases. That compared to a 95% effectiveness rate from January to April.
In a recent outbreak in Massachusetts, three-fourths of those infected were fully vaccinated, but few required hospitalization.

“The fight against the COVID pandemic is a global fight. The only way we can defeat COVID is together,” said Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett. “Together means sharing information, methods, technologies, and actionable steps. Israel is open to sharing all the information we can gain from this bold move.”
Israel had previously come under fire for refusing to provide vaccine does to Palestinians living under Israeli occupation, and only offering a vaccine swap to the Palestinian Authority that fell apart over the offered doses’ expiration dates.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved a third shot.

health,A Nevada woman is sharing her family’s heartbreak after her fiance expressed regret about not getting the COVID-19 vaccine shortly before dying from the disease.
health,"“He was only 39; our babies now don’t have a dad,” Jessica DuPreez told Las Vegas station KVVU. “You can’t say, ‘I’m young, and it won’t affect me.’ Because it will.”"
health,"DuPreez said she and her fiance, Michael Freedy, wanted to wait until the vaccine had been available for a year, to see how it might affect people."
health,"“There was never any intention to not get it,” she said."
health,"Shortly after the couple traveled to San Diego for vacation with their five kids, ages 1 to 17, DuPreez said Freedy fell ill from a bad sunburn and had to be admitted to an ER. There, he tested positive for COVID-19 and his health went downhill."
health,"“He’s panicking, saying how he doesn’t wanna die and he doesn’t wanna leave his babies without a dad,” DuPreez told USA Today."
health,"Scans showed that he contracted pneumonia in both of his lungs. He eventually had to be placed on a ventilator and, against his wishes, forcefully sedated, DuPreez said in a GoFundMe post."
health,"She told KVVU that his last text message to her was, “I should have gotten the damn vaccine.”"
health,"“Hug your loved ones. Because it turned so fast,” she wrote on the GoFundMe page. “And I would give practically anything to hear Mike say my name and hug me and be able to tell him I love him more than ever.”"
health,"Since Freedy’s diagnosis, DuPreez said she has gotten vaccinated, as has her oldest child. She is now encouraging anyone who is on the fence about getting the vaccine purely because of side effect concerns to get it."
health,"“Everybody can have a bad reaction to any vaccine throughout history but I would take a bad reaction to the vaccine over having to bury my husband,” she told CNN."
health,"More than 610,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the U.S. since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, according to the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention."
health,"While deaths have generally continued to decline nationwide since vaccines became available, there has been an uptick in COVID-19 deaths in recent weeks, due to the more-contagious delta variant of the virus."
health,"The CDC last week reversed its earlier mask guidance and now recommends that all people ― regardless of vaccination status ― wear masks when indoors in parts of the country where there’s a substantial risk of COVID-19 transmission. That’s more than half of the country, according to the latest data."
health,“We can’t let COVID win.”
health,"This was my colleague’s mantra when the pandemic started last year. And for the almost 18 months since, health care workers have rallied to the battlefields, even at times when we had no weapons to brandish."
health,"We took care of the infected and the critically ill when no one else would. We reused N95 masks, carefully placing them in labeled brown paper bags in between shifts. We witnessed lonely deaths and held up iPads for families to say their heartbreaking goodbyes. We created elaborate backup schedules and neglected our personal lives. We stepped up during surges and when our colleagues fell ill. Camaraderie in the ICU had never been stronger because we recognized that this was a team effort and all of humanity was battling against a common enemy."
health,"But as health care workers, we also were painfully aware of our own vulnerabilities. We can run out of ICU resources for our patients. We can run out of personal protective equipment for ourselves. We can be exposed on the job and get sick. And we can die — many of us did, more than 3,600 from COVID-19 in the first year."
health,"Many of us quarantined away from our families to protect the ones we love. We counted the risk factors of our children, our elderly parents, our spouses, and came up with our own formulas to decide whether to come home at the end of the shift or hole up in a hotel room. One of our ICU directors wrote and rewrote our COVID-19 clinical guidelines to keep up with the evolving literature and somehow she carved out the time to write her own will."
health,"I worked daily to adapt our end-of-life program to the changing needs and restrictions of the pandemic and signed up for a vaccine clinical trial as soon as one became available. I also updated my own advance directive and printed it out for my husband, just in case."
health,"Then, effective vaccines became widely available in the U.S. — I briefly saw light at the end of the tunnel. The number of patients with COVID-19 in ICUs across the country plummeted. It looked like our sacrifices and commitment as health care workers had paid off. We believed herd immunity could become a reality and we could return to some sense of normalcy."
health,"But the relief was short-lived, the hope was fleeting, and we are amid another surge. A surge that is fueled by a highly transmissible variant and those unvaccinated. My experiences in the ICU these past weeks have left me surprised, disheartened, but most of all, angry."
health,"I am angry that the tragic scenes of prior surges are being played out yet again, but now with ICUs primarily filled with patients who have chosen not to be vaccinated. I am angry that it takes me over an hour to explain to an anti-vaxxer full of misinformation that intubation isn’t what “kills patients” and that their wish for chest compressions without intubation in the event of a respiratory arrest makes no sense. I am angry at those who refuse to wear “muzzles” when grocery shopping for half an hour a week, as I have been so-called “muzzled” for much of the past 18 months."
health,"I cannot understand the simultaneous decision to not get vaccinated and the demand to end the restrictions imposed by a pandemic. I cannot help but recoil as if I’ve been slapped in the face when my ICU patient tells me they didn’t get vaccinated because they “just didn’t get around to it.” Although such individuals do not consider themselves anti-vaxxers, their inaction itself is a decision — a decision to not protect themselves or their families, to fill a precious ICU bed, to let new variants flourish, and to endanger the health care workers and immunosuppressed people around them. Their inaction is a decision to let this pandemic continue to rage."
health,"And meanwhile, immunocompromised people, for whom vaccines don’t generate much immunity, are desperately waiting for herd immunity. I have no way to comfort my rightfully outraged transplant patients who contracted COVID-19 after isolating for over a year and getting fully vaccinated as soon as they could. With angry tears, these patients tell me it’s not fair that there are people who are choosing to endanger both themselves and the vulnerable people around them. They feel betrayed by their fellow citizens and they are bitter and angry. I cannot blame them."
health,"I thought when this pandemic began that we were all in this fight together, engaged in a war against a common enemy. Now, I painfully realize: Perhaps we were never on the same side and we never had a common enemy. Perhaps the war has been among ourselves all along. We have won many battles but unvaccinated America is choosing to let COVID win the war. "
health,"I am at a loss to understand how anyone can look at these past months of the pandemic — more than 600,000 lives lost in the U.S. and more than 4 million worldwide — and not believe it’s real or take it seriously. But the unhappy truth is that there are people who do not. They did not in the beginning and many are doubling down now. "

health,I attended four Zoom funerals during the pandemic.
health,Each one was populated by squares of pixelated faces grieving from home online together; heartfelt eulogies glitching; poems and video montages jittery with spotty reception.
health,"During one, on my laptop screen, a burial was being broadcast graveside. I watched a few masked loved ones shoveling dirt atop the grave, the quiet dig of metal against earth, a muffling wind blowing past the mic. Then suddenly, my screen was filled with an elderly couple in their kitchen discussing strawberries. Another couple needed an appointment, a phone call had to be returned. Mics accidentally unmuted switched the viewers from gravesite to kitchens and living rooms across the country."
health,"Those of us who had tuned in for the funeral overheard mundanities meant for no one juxtaposed with a burial meant for everyone, which only few could attend in person because of the pandemic. We saw up-close, grief-stricken faces muttering private sorrows into the screen. We did the best we could, given travel restrictions, coming together virtually in ceremony. Yet, why did everything about these pandemic-style funerals feel so wrong? What do we do now with all the grief that never had its proper chance to be shared in person?"
health,"“Zoom” used to be a live-action TV show I watched in the 1970s and ’80s. Inspired by shows like “The Electric Company” and “Sesame Street,” “Zoom” was a high-energy show created and performed by kids. The show played fast and furious across the screen ― zooming. The word itself, “zoom,” flies from the mouth as soon as the teeth come together with the buzz of the Z. Death whisks a life away ― zoom ― and the person is gone."
health,"There is something inherently zippy and frenetic about the word zoom. The word “funeral” is slow and languorous, heavy on the downbeat of the long U. Funerals are a pause in the frenzy. These two words repel each other. They do not belong together. Zoom + funeral. And yet, here I was, in all my grief, clicking to join."
health,"Now it’s a given ― that whispering voice reminding us this is not how it’s supposed to be. And yet some things seem easier to accept: hand sanitizer everywhere, taped arrows directing traffic on grocery store floors, mannequins sporting masks. We’ve learned to stand back. Give space. These new rhythms creep into our habits as we cross the street to avoid each other — the sidewalk no longer suitable for two."
health,"We find ourselves adjusting. While our children are appalled at old TV shows where passengers smoke cigarettes on airplanes, we now cringe at scenes of crowds hustling through packed train stations, bumping mindlessly into one another, carelessly shaking bare hands. How reckless! A mix of horror and nostalgia flood us. How could they? We wonder how we’ve been catapulted so quickly and so far from what once seemed normal."
health,Some of these new habits actually seem like improvements: Why haven’t we always called ahead from the parking lot of doctors’ offices? Why would we ever again blow out candles on a cake meant to share? But the Zoom funeral is one thing I hope never settles into a permanent ritual.
health,"In my culturally mixed upbringing, I’ve been accustomed to funerals extending beyond an hourlong ceremony. On my Jewish side, after the burial, we sit shiva for a weeklong gathering ― a coming together with food and loved ones to mourn together, day after day. On my Greek Orthodox side, we follow a multipart ritual that includes an evening wake, and after the funeral, a festive Greek luncheon, and we continue memorial services the following Sunday, and again 40 days later, and yet again a year later."
health,Part of the comfort in these traditions is knowing we will continue coming together. None of them end with Zoom’s red button or being told this meeting has been ended by the host.
health,"I logged on 15 minutes early to the funeral for my dear friend. It was a private gathering of her family members in a beautiful outdoor garden halfway across the country. I sat on my bed, alone, surrounded by a scatter of photographs I’d collected of her and me together over the past 32 years."
health,"I waited for the host to start the meeting. When the camera turned on, it faced a table in front of a fence with flowers. And then I heard voices. The service had not yet begun, but the host had forgotten to mute the call. My heart picked up its pace, relieved at having unexpectedly been transported there."
health,"I shut my eyes, privy to the small talk, grateful for the technical error. I recognized my friend’s family members’ voices. I was there, standing beside them amongst the chatter, invisible, yet there."
health,"I imagined my friend witnessing the same, hovering unseen, surrounded by their voices, as close as she could ever come. Then, suddenly midsentence, everything went silent. The host discovered the error."
health,"Alone again in my bed, I reached for my photos. My heart constricting, I logged out of Zoom and back in, hoping to find the loophole, trying to get back to the sound, but as more and more people around the country joined the call, everything remained muted. Then the service began."
health,My heart fluttered with that urgency you get when you land on a sudden truth. Hallelujah! I quickly opened to the page.
health,"After a couple months, I started reading through a stack of books on loss trying to understand why I wasn’t marching efficiently through Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’ clearly delineated five stages of grief. That is when I came across Chapter 2 in David Kessler’s book “Finding Meaning: The Sixth Stage of Grief.” When I scanned the table of contents and read the chapter title, I shouted, “Yes, that’s it!” in my kitchen: “Chapter Two: Grief Must Be Witnessed.”"
health,"Kessler describes our intrinsic need, beginning from the time we are infants, for our emotional states to be acknowledged. He describes an experiment conducted with mothers and infants. When one mother responds to her infant with a blank stare rather than mirroring back the infant’s expression, the baby begins to scream in agony."
health,The ultimate terror. We carry it with us. This human need to see one another.
health,"“The reality is that we heal as a tribe,” Kessler writes. On a 45-minute Zoom meeting, through the computer screen, we are not healing as a tribe. We are not bearing witness. We are not truly coming together. It is not a sufficient substitute. If others, like myself, feel stuck in grief, perhaps we can attribute it to this innate need being shortchanged."
health,"My husband’s friend also died young, and after his Zoom funeral the host opened it up to viewers to share stories of him in a beautiful attempt at creating an intimate space through the computer. Each person who shared was put in presenter mode, their face taking up the screen while the others disappeared from view. One person’s mic stopped working, cutting them off mid-story, and another’s screen froze right as they started sharing; the inability to interject or respond or add on caused each story to hang in the space unacknowledged. Stories were spoken, but it was unclear whether they’d been received."
health,"A family member freezes mid-cry. We try to look away. We try to reach out and touch. We try to wipe tears. At the Zoom funeral, we still have our strawberries or our appointments to discuss, our calls to be made. We are surrounded by our lives, mistakenly aired. These recurring bloopers sting because they shriek of our separation."
health,"Kessler also writes about a researcher studying the ways of Indigenous villages in Australia. A villager told him that when someone dies, the members of the community move a piece of furniture outside their homes and onto their lawns, so when the grieving family wakes up, they see that nothing looks the same. A visual representation, an offering, acknowledging yes, the world has turned upside down, see our bed, our kitchen table, our chairs, everything is mixed up, the world has changed. I cannot imagine a more profound offering in grief, this physical acknowledgment that might keep us from screaming in distress when the Zoom call ends."
health,"We need to come together in grief. We need to feel the hands of others who were connected to this person on each other’s shoulders. We need to stand close, share stories, wipe tears, in real time and space, not through a pixelated screen where at any moment the connection might drop."
health,"When we get through this pandemic, I want to redo all the Zoom funerals. I want us all to get together in person, hug one another for every day we were unable to do so. But my fear is that our culture of grieving will not approve of it. It will not want all our pain and sadness to persist, and so it will have tracked our grief on the calendar and told us our allotted time has passed. It will say, “It’s been a year, two years, five years, you have moved on, you have healed.” It will say, “At least you had Zoom, at least you could connect that way; at least you had a lifelong friendship. Some people never do.”"
health,"When we get together again, it will be for a birthday, a wedding, a graduation, to celebrate; it will be joyous and full of life because this is good and we feel comfortable. We will no longer mourn what has already been screenshared. We have left the meeting. This meeting has ended. The ghosts have gone. The spirits ascended. We have moved on. We have found closure. We’ve clicked the solid red rectangle on the bottom of the screen. Shut the laptop. The host has ended this meeting."
health,And yet.
health,We yearn for it.
health,Our primal need stirs.
health,We cry out in agony.
health,Grief must be witnessed.
health,We are weighed down in accumulated grief.
health,We need to set it down.
health,Together.
health,"When the pandemic ends, if we cannot redo all the Zoom funerals, I will turn my house inside out, haul all of my furniture onto our small front lawn facing the busy street and leave it there. I will sit on the bare floor in an empty house and watch the passersby pause. I will see them wonder if it is their imagination or if the world indeed has turned inside out like they had suspected, because they, too, have lost someone this year, and they, too, did not come together to mourn. And they’ll nod at the display, at the chaotic arrangement of bed and chair and table mismatched on the grass, validating each item as they do. And maybe, someone will stop and sit down to rest on one of the chairs, take a moment in comfort, relieved at the mere sight of it. And then I will step outside and someone else will stop and perhaps lie down on the bed, and another and then another. And then, in a house turned inside out, in a world trying to regain its shape, we will cry and laugh and remember and share in all the beautiful lives we loved and lost, together."

health,"Full disclosure, I wasn’t even going to watch the Olympics this year."
health,"I’d considered watching Track and Field just to see Sha’Carri Richardson literally run circles around her competition. But when she was disqualified for having THC in her system, it felt as though watching the Olympics wouldn’t be worth my time."
health,"Until earlier this month, when Simone Biles stunned the world by becoming the first woman to nail the new triple-double (which I understand will soon be called the Biles II). I was hooked. In just a matter of seconds, Biles had changed me from someone who might watch an Olympic event (if there was nothing else on) to a 2021 summer Olympics fan. "
health,"So when I heard that she had pulled out of the first event that I was all excited to watch, I was like, “What the fu ... ?”"
health,"At first, this sentiment seemed to be echoed by most of the people I follow on social media. But then within an hour, other posts appeared, posts applauding Biles for her decision to take care of herself. Once I understood what she’d done, my dismay was instantly eclipsed by a swell of emotion. "
health,I got it.
health,"Suddenly the magnitude of the risk she’d taken to administer self-care came into strikingly crisp focus, and everything else faded into the background. Simone Biles, a young Black woman, a survivor of the foster care system, a survivor of years of sexual abuse, the woman who volunteered to be a participant in the reckoning for that abuser during his trial, the woman who took our collective breath away when she won medals with injuries that would have sidelined anyone else. "
health,"And oh, did I mention that she’s Black?"
health,"Simone Biles was saying, “No. I’m not going to push myself any further. And while it may be inconvenient timing, I’m out. I just need to let the girls do it and focus on myself.”"
health,"It’s a fact worth underscoring as our nation’s health care system has a terrible track record when it comes to treating our communities of color, especially women."
health,Including me.
health,"And it gets even worse when we’re talking about mental health. Add to that the fact that one study shows that 63% of Black people don’t “believe in” mental illness, dismissing it as a weakness or something on which white people spend their time and money. Many Black people are ashamed about having a mental illness and worry that they may be judged or discriminated against."
health,"After my sons were born, I struggled with postpartum depression, and I kept it to myself. When I thought about confessing what was happening to my husband or to my friends, fear conspired with pride to keep me silent. "
health,"And in my friend groups where I was the only Black one, I felt an extra incentive to be close-lipped. I didn’t want anyone conflating my race with whatever this was ― this defectiveness. I was determined to represent strong, Black women proudly. "
health,"I tried my best to serve everyone ultimate wife/mom perfection, to be above the fray. The terror of being pitied or judged loomed larger than my instinct to preserve myself."
health,But Biles did.
health,"The truth was that I was embarrassed to be struggling with my mental health. I was scared to ask for help because people might label me as yet another weak, crazy Black female. I didn’t know it was possible to survive something like that. I had no Black role model who’d come before me to say, “I’m going to step away and take care of myself, and I don’t give a shit what people have to say about it.”"
health,"Citing “mental health issues,” Naomi Osaka, ranked No. 2 in the world in women’s tennis, refused to speak to the press during the French Open this past May. Shortly afterward, she was fined and threatened with expulsion by the tournament organizers. And later (in a now-deleted tweet), she was mocked by the tournament organizer’s Twitter account. "
health,"Why is it so hard for us to accept that our athletes are human? Why do we as a society place so much value on them pushing themselves through injuries, mental and physical? Michael Jordan was lauded after playing through the stomach flu in the 1995 NBA finals and bringing The Bulls to victory. The late Kobe Bryant received cheers and chest bumps after receiving four bags of IV fluids (two before the game and two at halftime) during Game 6 against the Denver Nuggets in 2012. These Black men were and are revered for being warriors, for playing through the pain and illness in order to win."
health,"Famously shy and soft-spoken, Osaka revealed that she had been dealing with anxiety and depression since bursting into the limelight by winning the U.S. Open in 2018, the first of her four Grand Slam titles."
health,"I can’t imagine what it must be like, to be a woman of color who has trained all of her life for a chance to play on those courts or in those stadiums. I can’t picture what it would be like to have talent like that, to have the eyes of the world on you, and then to say, “No, I will not wait until this event is over, I won’t wait a few more weeks. I won’t wait another hour ― I am administering self-care right NOW.”"
health,"But for women of color in the Olympic Games, there is an additional expectation, for they have always carried a triple cross of race, gender and athlete. Black women throughout American history have been objectified like no other category of people, and we’ve never had a credible voice in our society. Remember how when Serena Williams won the French Open in 2015, and someone on social media called her a “gorilla”?"
health,"And when Osaka subsequently withdrew from the French Open, and then a few weeks later, Wimbledon, She released a statement through her agent. A statement which read in part, “Naomi won’t be playing Wimbledon this year. She is taking some personal time with friends and family.”"
health,"Black female athletes are expected to be strong but not aggressive and tough without looking masculine (whatever that means) — and don’t get me started on the white, American standard of beauty imposed upon us. Remember all of the criticism Gabby Douglas got about her hair after being the first Black female gymnast to win an all-around Olympic gold medal? "
health,"I don’t know if it’s a coincidence that both Biles and Osaka stole the Olympic headlines on the same day during BIPOC Mental Health Month (Biles withdrew from her event, and Naomi lost her match). But I hope that their courageous actions will have a long-lasting impact, not just on The Olympics but also on society."
health,"The image I’ll keep of Osaka from the Tokyo Olympics is not her loss to Marketa Vonderousova in the third round, but of her giving us all the feels as she lit the Olympic torch during the opening ceremonies. And the pictures I’ll keep of Biles are the ones of her urging her girls to go on to victory and cheering the men’s Olympic Team on during a practice. "
health,"By taking a stand, Naomi built a platform on which she could finally speak freely about her mental health, and now Simone Biles has bravely stepped onto that same platform and said, “Me too.” "
health,"Both of these young Black female athletes understand something that I didn’t when I was still grappling with how to save both my face and my ass. They understand that safeguarding their mental health isn’t quitting, nor is it a sign of weakness. They know that mental health has to come before the sport(s) they love, before the medals and the trophies they want to win. And for that, Biles and Osaka will always be champions in my book."
health,"The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee is reviewing U.S. swimmer Michael Andrew’s refusal to wear a mask during interviews with reporters Friday at the Tokyo Olympics, USA Today reported."
health,"The newspaper, which called Andrew the “highest profile unvaccinated American Olympian,” reported the swimmer’s failure to wear a mask in the indoor mixed interview zone to authorities. U.S. officials acknowledged Andrew’s behavior was a “violation” of COVID-19 protocols and began a review."
health,"USA Today columnist Christine Brennan said other U.S. swimmers have worn masks, except when the athletes competed or posed briefly for photos during the medal ceremonies."
health,"Andrew finished fifth in the men’s 200-meter individual medley on Friday, falling short of a medal for a second time."
health,"Asked again why he was the lone American breaking the rules, Andrew told USA Today: “No reason. I’ll throw it on when I’m done here, but to speak, it’s difficult, probably people can hear me.”"
health,"He said he found it hard to breathe after racing, “so I feel like my health is a little more tied to being able to breathe than protecting what’s coming out of my mouth.”"
health,"Andrew, who said he had COVID-19 previously, told reporters earlier in July that he did not get the vaccine for fear that it would interrupt his preparation. And he had no plan to get inoculated in the future, either."
health,"“Delta is different than previous strains,” reads a slide in a CDC presentation dated Thursday. "
health,The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that “the war” against the coronavirus “has changed” in newly reported internal documents evaluating the threat of the delta variant. 
health,"The presentation is circulating within the CDC as the agency considers new public health messaging around vaccine effectiveness and the risk of breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated people. Such cases are still rare, the agency said, and generally not severe, but they are somewhat more likely to happen with the delta variant than with other coronavirus strains. "
health,"They offer a clearer picture of why the CDC announced earlier this week that people in certain high-risk areas should resume wearing face masks indoors, even if they are vaccinated, and hint that the agency may be reevaluating other community strategies to mitigate the pandemic, which is now regaining strength in every state. "
health,"To put the risk in a more familiar context, the delta variant is as contagious as chickenpox, the agency said. It is more contagious than the common cold, smallpox, Ebola, SARS or MERS."
health,"But in breakthrough cases, vaccinated people may be able to transmit the delta variant just as easily as unvaccinated people, the CDC slides say. The suggestion contradicts earlier published studies, conducted before the delta variant became prominent, that have found vaccinated people may transmit significantly less virus than unvaccinated people."
health,The slides were first obtained by The Washington Post on Thursday and subsequently obtained by NBC News and The New York Times. 
health,"The good news is that the CDC believes vaccines prevent over 90% of severe illnesses in people who contract the delta variant, according to the internal presentation. Researchers have always understood that some people, particularly the elderly or the immunocompromised, might catch COVID-19, even if they are fully vaccinated. The point is to control the spread, and prevent serious illness and death. "
health,"The infection was not severe in most vaccinated patients; just four required hospitalization, and some had preexisting conditions. "
health,"Alex Morse, mayor of Provincetown, Massachusetts ― where the crowded events were held ― said via Twitter that the CDC’s findings represented good news because the vaccines were shown to be working as intended. "
health,"The study’s authors noted several limitations, including that “data from this report are insufficient to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, including the Delta variant, during this outbreak.” "
health,"On Friday, the agency highlighted the results of a new study conducted in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, looking at a July COVID-19 outbreak following multiple large public gatherings held indoors and outdoors. Out of nearly 470 infections, around three-quarters occurred in people who had been fully vaccinated. Researchers analyzed samples from 133 of the cases and identified the delta variant in 90% of them. "
health,"“Acknowledge the war has changed,” reads one bullet point. "
health,"Yet in a statement, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky urged caution, saying that the study demonstrates “that Delta infection resulted in similarly high SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in vaccinated and unvaccinated people.”"
health,"“This finding is concerning and was a pivotal discovery leading to CDC’s updated mask recommendation,” Walensky said. She went on to note that that the Massachusetts study “is one of many [the] CDC has been involved in across the country and data from those investigations will be rapidly shared with the public when available.”"
health,"As the delta variant spreads, vaccine mandates are being imposed at the federal, state and local levels. California is requiring all health care workers to get their shots following the strong urging of medical professional groups."
health,"In its internal presentation, the CDC states that public health messaging surrounding the vaccines has gone awry and suggests what experts should do to encourage more people to get vaccinated and follow safety guidelines ― including helping people better understand breakthrough infections and vaccine effectiveness. "
health,Businesses also are joining the trend. Google announced this week that any employee wishing to return to its offices will have to show proof of vaccination. 
health,"“Masking is one defense against the spread of COVID-19, but make no mistake: Vaccines are the best defense against you getting severely ill from COVID-19,” Biden said at a press conference announcing the policy."
health,"President Joe Biden announced Thursday that all federal employees and contractors must be vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing and abide by other safety restrictions, reflecting the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant of the virus that threatens to prolong the pandemic."
health,"“Breakthrough cases remain rare, and almost all are mild cases,” Biden said of vaccinated people who contract the virus. “In fact, virtually all hospitalizations and deaths are among the unvaccinated.”"
health,The president said earlier this week that a vaccine mandate for government workers was under consideration following months of messaging from the nation’s leading public health officials that vaccines are the key to ending a pandemic that has upended life for more than a year and a half.
health,Unvaccinated federal employees will have to comply with several safety rules if they want to return to work. 
health,"The federal rules echo those imposed in California and New York City, but on a massive scale: There are more than 4 million federal employees and about 6 million contractors or grant workers who are subject to the guidelines."
health,"“Anyone who does not attest to being fully vaccinated will be required to wear a mask on the job no matter their geographic location, physically distance from all other employees and visitors, comply with a weekly or twice weekly screening testing requirement, and be subject to restrictions on official travel,” the White House said in a statement."
health,"The U.S. mandate comes amid a surge in cases linked to the highly transmissible delta variant of COVID-19. Stalled vaccination rates in many parts of the country have allowed an uptick in every state, prompting the return of mask mandates in some areas and warnings that the pandemic remains a dire issue for the unvaccinated."
health,"The president also announced several other efforts to increase vaccination rates, including calling on state and local governments to offer residents $100 to get vaccinated against the coronavirus ― something that studies show could incentivize people. "
health,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its mask guidance this week, recommending all people in certain parts of the country ― even those who have been fully vaccinated ― wear masks indoors in some public spaces. Staff at the White House have been instructed to wear masks inside again, and lawmakers in the House have also been asked to resume wearing them. "
health,"Biden addressed some of the reasons people have given for avoiding the vaccines, including a belief prevalent among conservatives that they haven’t been properly tested for safety. He emphasized that the available vaccines are built on decades of research that started long before the pandemic hit last year, and that the vaccine rollout started under a Republican president and continued under a Democratic one."
health,"All of the vaccines approved for use in the U.S. are effective against the delta strain. Though stories of breakthrough infections in vaccinated people are becoming more common, vaccines largely prevent severe illness and death associated with COVID-19."
health,"“According to research from the University of California, Los Angeles, roughly one-third of unvaccinated individuals said a cash payment would make them more likely to get a shot,” the White House noted. "
health,"The Department of Veterans Affairs said this week that coronavirus vaccines would be mandatory for the more than 100,000 front-line health care workers at the federal agency, the first to do so."
health,"The director of the CDC, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, has said in recent weeks the delta variant is among the most transmissible viruses known to science. The strain now makes up about 83% of new cases. Walensky said earlier this month about 97% of people hospitalized with the coronavirus have not been vaccinated."
health,Olivia Munn opened up about living with depression and the guidance that helps her through the toughest days during an appearance on Demi Lovato’s new talk show. 
health,"In the 2018 Instagram post that Lovato referred to, Munn told followers that she’d “lived with anxiety and sporadic bouts of depression for most of my adult life” and had worked to address it about a decade earlier. She said that being depressed didn’t necessarily mean someone wanted to die, but that the “ongoing, relentless darkness” can become “too painful to endure anymore.” "
health,Revisiting the caption led Munn to share the advice that’s kept her going during some of her darkest times. 
health,"Lovato, in a clip first shared by ET Online Thursday, spoke about an Instagram caption that Munn posted a few years ago that read: “But please listen to me ― from someone who is telling you that she’s been where you are ― when I say that SUICIDE IS NOT THE RIGHT CHOICE.” The post also offered up international suicide prevention phone numbers and told followers “one phone call could change everything.” "
health,"“You don’t have to suffer from anxiety and depression to feel that low,” she added then. “Something very sad or traumatic can happen to you just once to bring about that feeling of despair.”"
health,"“Because, if you take your life, game over. It’s done,” “The Newsroom” actor said. “You don’t get to see what will happen in 10 years.”"
health,"“The pain is really tough. I know, you know. We’ve been there,” Munn added. “But if I had ended my life when I wanted to, there is so much I would have missed.”"
health,"“For people who deal with depression like you and me ― and who can have suicidal thoughts ― anytime you get to that place and it seems like things are too tough and you just can’t take it anymore, just ask yourself if you can hold on another day,” Munn told Lovato in the emotional clip. "
health,Experts say that anyone dealing with thoughts of self-harm should address them as soon as possible. 
health,"
“If you are struggling with your feelings and you begin to think to yourself, ‘If I hurt myself, would that take the pain away?’ that is your first sign that something could be wrong,” Dan Reidenberg, executive director of Suicide Awareness Voices of Education, told HuffPost last year. “You might not actually engage in any self-harming behaviors, but the idea that you have thought of it is your ‘yellow caution light’ that you need to talk to someone before it progresses to actual self-harm.”
People also can try distracting themselves with a walk or watching funny TV as short-term solutions, while also trying to figure out what’s making you consider self-harm. Next steps should include telling someone you trust about the feelings you’re having and getting help from a mental health professional."
health,The Food and Drug Administration said it is working “as quickly as possible” to grant full approval for the COVID-19 vaccines currently being distributed under emergency permits. 
health,"To date, the FDA has not said precisely when it will complete the process, but an agency official told CNN, and confirmed to HuffPost, that it was urgently reviewing the drugmakers’ applications. "
health,"“Although an authorization is not an FDA approval, the FDA conducted a thorough scientific evaluation of each of the authorized vaccines and can assure the public and medical community that the vaccines meet FDA’s rigorous standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality,” the official said. "
health,Full approval will hinge on several months of additional data. 
health,"The FDA announced earlier this month that it was prioritizing review of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine (which was the first to be approved for distribution in the United States) and aims to be done by January 2022. However, as FDA Acting Commissioner Janet Woodcock noted on Twitter, that does not mean it will not be approved before that target."
health,"The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were each granted an Emergency Use Authorization from the agency in December, while the Johnson & Johnson shot was granted its EUA in February. "
health,"“Quite to the contrary, the review of [Pfizer’s application] has been ongoing, is among the highest priorities of the agency, and the agency intends to complete the review far in advance of the [goal date],” Woodcock said. "
health,"Since December, more than 340 million doses of the vaccine have been distributed across the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
health,"But less than half of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated, and the nation has seen a spike in COVID-19 cases due to the delta variant. The new cases are concentrated in areas with low vaccination rates. When viruses are allowed to spread unchecked, they have more opportunity to mutate, and those mutations could make them more dangerous to humans. "
health,"MIAMI (AP) — As coronavirus cases continue to soar, two Florida mayors are announcing mask and vaccine mandates and defying the governor who is firmly opposed to any pandemic restrictions."
health,Masks will again be required at indoor county facilities in Florida’s populous Miami-Dade following new federal guidance recommending that even people vaccinated against COVID-19 should wear facial coverings.
health,"And in Orange County, home to Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando Resort, the mayor went a step further and announced all 4,200 nonunion county employees will be required to get their first coronavirus vaccine shot by the end of August, and the second shot by the end of September. Disney World announced on its website Wednesday evening that beginning July 30, face coverings will be required for all guests ages 2 and up while indoors and in Disney buses, monorail and Disney Skyliner, regardless of vaccination status. This includes upon entering and throughout all attractions. Face coverings remain optional in outdoor common areas."
health,"“We want to keep our county and theme parks open for business,” Mayor Jerry Demings said at a news conference Wednesday. “By instituting these measures, we want everyone to know, in Orange County, Florida, we take the coronavirus seriously.”"
health,"“We have all come too far. We have all sacrificed too much in this past almost year and a half. We cannot turn back now,” Levine Cava said."
health,Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said her decision is a response to the surge in new cases and hospitalizations. The mayors didn’t announce any mandates for businesses but pleaded with them to help get their employees vaccinated and urged them to again implement the use of masks.
health,"A state law signed in May gives Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis the power to invalidate local emergency measures put in place during the pandemic, including mask mandates and limitations on business operations. It also bans any business or government entity from requiring proof of vaccination. The governor’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the new local mandates."
health,"The delta variant of the coronavirus is causing infection surges across the U.S., with Florida accounting for a fifth of the nation’s new cases last week, more than any other state, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hospitals have seen admissions soar with the vast majority of the patients unvaccinated."
health,"For the more than 3,000 unionized workers in Orange County, Demings said officials were negotiating a similar vaccine requirement as nonunion employees. Some can be exempt for religious or health reasons, but others who fail to comply will face disciplinary action, Demings said."
health,"On Tuesday, the CDC changed course on some masking guidelines and recommended that even vaccinated people should wear masks indoors in areas of high transmission. Officials cited new information revealing the variant’s ability to spread among vaccinated people."
health,"All 67 of Florida’s counties are considered areas of high transmission, meaning they have more than 100 new cases per 100,000 people in the past seven days."
health,"“I think it’s very important we say, unequivocally, ‘No to lockdowns, no to school closures, no to restrictions, no to mandates,’” he said."
health,"DeSantis has remained staunchly opposed to restrictions, mask mandates and vaccine passports, a stance central to his reelection campaign. He was defiant Wednesday as he criticized the new CDC guidance during a Salt Lake City gathering of the American Legislative Exchange Council, a group that pushes conservative policies in Republican-controlled state legislatures."
health,"Democratic Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, who is running to challenge DeSantis in 2022, suggested that local governments get creative about measures and vaccine campaigns."
health,"“Local governments are handcuffed right now about what they can do,” Fried said at a news conference Wednesday prior to the announcement of the two mayors. “We are stuck in a situation that all we can be doing is giving information out there, encouraging people to do what’s right for their communities.”"
health,"School board members in Broward County held a special meeting Wednesday to discuss mask-wearing, a day after roughly two dozen mask opponents disrupted the meeting in screaming matches and burned masks outside the building. Board members agreed to continue requiring masks for at least the beginning of the school year, making it the first district in the state to do so. Miami-Dade school officials have said they’re reconsidering their mask policy following the recent CDC recommendations, but no decision has been made."
health,"Earlier this week, DeSantis hinted at a bill to oppose mask mandates in schools, a decision that is still up to school districts. The CDC on Tuesday also recommended indoor masks for all teachers and students nationwide, regardless of vaccination status. DeSantis predicted lawmakers would hold a special session to address the issue, saying “our Legislature feels strongly about it.”"
health,"“Please stop the insanity. You have already done damage to these kids having to wear masks,” she said before putting her daughter up to the microphone. The young girl complained that she can’t breathe when she wears a mask and gets headaches from them."
health,"Vivian Hug, a Navy veteran, brought her twins with her as she addressed board members, saying she was tired of giving up “freedoms in the name of safety.”"

health,The brief argues that Roe v. Wade ― which determined that patients must be able to seek abortions without excessive government restriction ― is an “unwarranted intrusion into the sovereign sphere of the States” and that giving the power back to states would be effective at “deescalating tensions on this divisive topic.” 
health,"Hundreds of Republican lawmakers, including 12 governors and 228 members of Congress, filed a set of amicus briefs Thursday urging the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade and restore states’ power to ban abortion access. "
health,"One comes from 12 governors led by South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster. Its co-signers include Gov. Kay Ivey of Alabama, Gov. Douglas Ducey of Arizona, Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, Gov. Brad Little of Idaho, Gov. Kim Reynolds of Iowa, Gov. Michael Parson of Missouri, Gov. Greg Gianforte of Montana, Gov. J. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma and Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas."
health,"Both briefs were filed in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a case the Supreme Court plans to hear later this year concerning the constitutionality of pre-viability abortions. If the justices side with the anti-abortion movement, the landmark decision in Roe v. Wade would essentially be voided and states would be free to restrict abortion at every stage of pregnancy, upending nearly 50 years of protections for access to the procedure. "
health,"“Today’s action is another step closer to overturning Roe v. Wade and securing the precious gift of life for an untold number of children,” McMaster said in a statement Thursday. "
health,That’s unlikely. Recent polls have found that more than 60% of Americans support full abortion access in the first trimester of pregnancy ― a protection several of these governors have tried to eliminate by signing legislation that effectively bans abortion halfway through that period. Some 57% of respondents said abortion should be legal overall in all or most cases — 76% of Democrats and 36% of Republicans.
health,"But doctors say that’s untrue, noting that many attempted abortion bans rest on completely unscientific claims. The wave of “fetal heartbeat” laws are based on an arbitrary timeline, and the indicator they focus on is not actually a heartbeat, medical experts say. Other abortion laws severely limiting which providers can perform abortions hinge on a fallacy of abortion being a dangerous procedure, they’ve also noted. In reality, abortion has a very low risk of complications, even lower than that of a wisdom tooth removal. "
health,"The second amicus brief came from GOP members of Congress, including 44 from the Senate and 184 from the House. In it, they argue that lawmakers are “ready and able” to legislate around abortion in ways that are “grounded in the science of fetal development and maternal health.”"
health,"That amicus brief follows a separate one that Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) filed on Monday for the same Supreme Court case."
health,"“When is my next appointment?” I asked the nurse as she looked up at me, holding the probe that — just moments ago — was up my vagina."
health,"“I don’t know, the doctor will look at the results over lunch and call you later,” she responded nonchalantly. My mind raced with thoughts. Do I need to cancel my client calls tomorrow morning? "
health,"Shortly after lunchtime, I got a call from the nurse. “Your follicles are growing quickly, you need to come in tomorrow and the two open times we have are 8:30 a.m. or 10:00 a.m.,” she said. I had important calls scheduled for both of those times. I knew that no matter what, I would disappoint or inconvenience a client."
health,"I started my in vitro fertilization journey in 2019. I had no idea how disruptive the procedure would be. I had no idea that I’d lose thousands of dollars of potential business income and risk damaging professional relationships. And to top it off, I would have no guarantee that it would actually work. "
health,"While I have a teenage daughter, Jason didn’t have any biological children of his own. After a failed intrauterine insemination, we were initially hesitant to try IVF due to the time and financial investment. We ended up deciding to try just one round. Thankfully, my husband’s employer offered IVF insurance for some of the costs, and after discussing our options with a reproductive endocrinologist, we decided to move forward."
health,"I was just shy of my 39th birthday at the time we consulted a doctor about IVF. My husband, Jason, and I had recently married and we had been struggling to conceive naturally for nearly one year. "
health,"I had a bag of needles of different sizes. Using the bigger needle, I would mix two vials of powder with a saline solution. With a separate needle, I drew up the medicine from the vial and injected myself. To keep track of the process, I kept a special IVF calendar on my nightstand. And to make sure I was wearing the right patch, I wrote the date on the patch, since I had to change them every other day. "
health,"This meant that every morning, I took multiple pills. Throughout the day, I wore a patch, and each evening, I mixed medicines to inject into my stomach. "
health,"During my initial 12 days of IVF, I had to follow a complicated medical protocol. My particular IVF approach required four separate types of medication that had to be carefully prepared and administered. This includes medications for ovarian stimulation, medications for oocyte maturation, medications to prevent premature ovulation, and — if you have a healthy embryo — medications to prepare the lining of your uterus."
health,All of this was just for the first 12 days. The protocols to prepare my body for the embryo transfer were different and just as complicated.
health,"I was constantly terrified that I’d mess up the process and waste thousands of dollars of medicine. Along with the complicated pharmaceutical protocols and unpredictable, last-minute doctor appointments, I also experienced insomnia, emotional hormone fluctuations, bloating, and constant pain from the injections. Many of my eyelashes fell out."
health,"About five days into my second round of IVF, I received a call from a business partner, asking if I could cover a client consulting project for her. While I was delighted to help, I instantly checked my appointment calendar. "
health,"My husband and I had chosen to keep our IVF journey private. But worried that I’d sabotage our partnership, I ended up telling her about my unpredictable IVF schedule. "
health,"“I can help you if I don’t have a monitoring appointment that morning, or if I can get my monitoring appointment at 6:30 a.m., but I won’t know that until 2 p.m. the day before,” I told her. "
health,"Unfortunately, she needed an answer for the client that same day. That “no” cost me several thousand dollars. As an entrepreneur who needed the money for IVF, this was a hard pill to swallow."
health,"What I was least prepared for, however, was the emotional toll this process would take on me. "
health,"“Not for us,” I remember thinking. "
health,"In the first round of IVF, I produced just one embryo, and that one wasn’t genetically normal. In January 2020, Jason and I decided to try IVF one final time. We were thrilled to hear, just a month later, that I had two normal embryos. But days later, all elective medical procedures were put on pause because of COVID-19."
health,"Despite having two embryos ready, we had no idea when (or if) the procedure would continue. At this point, I was approaching 40 and knew that each day that passed was diminishing my chances of a successful pregnancy. At the time, social media was full of posts about the upcoming lockdown baby boom. "
health,"Because I had a history of pregnancy loss, I had to schedule blood draws every two days with the clinic. This meant even more schedule shuffling. "
health,"In May, we finally got clearance to continue the treatment. I started taking various medications to prepare the lining of my uterus for the embryo. Eight days after the transfer, I went to the clinic for a blood draw to see if my embryo transfer was successful. The nurse called a few hours later: “Great news, you’re pregnant!”"
health,"A few weeks in, my doctor phoned to tell me that my hormone levels had dropped and that I was in the process of miscarrying. I was devastated and confused. I had three pregnancy losses before, but I didn’t expect this to happen with IVF and a genetically normal embryo. We grieved this loss over the summer. "
health,"Two months after the miscarriage, I started the complicated medical schedule again. A few days after my second and final transfer, I learned my final embryo didn’t take. "
health,"This was almost more heartbreaking than the miscarriage. It meant our journey was final and wouldn’t end with a baby. I had spent two years investing money, time, energy and hope into this process. "
health,"At this point, Jason and I had decided to stop the IVF treatments. His employer’s insurance only covered up to a certain dollar amount and the emotional and physical toll of the treatments had become almost unbearable. "
health,"If I went through another round of IVF that was successful, I’d likely have a baby at 42, making it a high-risk pregnancy. Also, given my history of unexplained recurrent pregnancy loss, we didn’t want to pursue IVF again unless we had answers for the consistent losses. "
health,"In a world where women have been culturally conditioned to believe our worth is tied to our fertility, it’s not surprising that I had these thoughts. The world is built for heterosexual couples who choose to have children without medical intervention. Seeing this in the media and growing up in a religious community meant that I took on this narrative as my own. "
health,"For me, choosing to end IVF was the best decision, albeit a gut-wrenching one that I question nearly every day."
health,"Not only did I desperately want a baby with my husband, but I often feel like I’m cheating him out of a child. “He could have married someone younger,” I sometimes think."
health,"But Jason and I are working through this together. We know that conceiving a baby doesn’t make a marriage successful. Instead, we are lucky to have found each other, and Jason is a wonderful stepdad to my daughter, Hailey. "
health,"When my friends who have chosen to use IVF ask me for advice, I give them two words: “radical acceptance.” It’s important that you accept that you cannot control any of it: the timing, the appointments, or the outcome. Looking back, I wish I had cleared my work schedule for the duration of the treatment and focused on better self-care. "
health,"Dr. Stephanie Gustin, FACOG, reproductive endocrinologist and advocate for infertility warriors everywhere, shares her advice for people preparing themselves for IVF. “Give yourself grace. For many, IVF feels like very high stakes. It is expensive and often a culmination of years of trying before taking the plunge. But the reality is you can only do so much. Follow your medicine calendar and ask questions. Beyond that, be kind to yourself and your body. You are doing everything you can possibly be doing, and more,” she advises."
health,"For many families, IVF is a gift. For others, it doesn’t go as planned. Nevertheless, infertility treatment is something that everyone should have access to rather than only those who can afford it. "
health,IVF looks different for everyone. The important thing when going into an IVF treatment is creating realistic expectations that prepare you for the best — and the worst — it has to offer.

health,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is recommending that all people, regardless of vaccination status, wear masks in certain indoor public places as the nation continues to see growing coronavirus cases."
health,"This new recommendation is for parts of the U.S. where cases of the coronavirus are surging, as well as everyone in K-12 schools, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky said at a press conference Tuesday."
health,"“This pandemic continues to pose a threat to all Americans,” Walensky said while stressing the risk posed by the highly transmissible delta variant, which is predominant in the U.S."
health,"The delta variant behaves differently from past COVID-19 strains, with new scientific evidence showing that some vaccinated people infected with the variant may be contagious and able to spread the virus to others. "
health,"Walensky cautioned that if the virus is allowed to spread, it will continue to mutate and could eventually evade our vaccines. This could be “just a few mutations away,” she said."
health,"“This new science is worrisome,” she said, later adding that the “vast majority” of infections are still occurring in unvaccinated people."
health,"Roughly 46% of counties in the U.S. are seeing high transmission levels of the virus. Florida, Missouri, Louisiana, Arkansas and Alabama have reported the most positive cases in the latest seven-day period, according to the latest CDC data."
health,President Joe Biden called the updated mask guidance “another step on our journey to defeating this virus.”
health,"“More vaccinations and mask wearing in the areas most impacted by the delta variant will enable us to avoid the kind of lockdowns, shutdowns, school closures, and disruptions we faced in 2020. Unlike 2020, we have both the scientific knowledge and the tools to prevent the spread of this disease. We are not going back to that,” he said in a statement following the CDC’s announcement."
health,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, a chief medical adviser for Biden, had suggested that such measures may be taken on Sunday while warning that “we’re going in the wrong direction.”"
health,"“This is an issue predominantly among the unvaccinated, which is the reason why we’re out there, practically pleading with the unvaccinated people to go out and get vaccinated,” Fauci said in an interview with CNN’s “State of the Union.”"
health,"Vaccination rates peaked in April and, after gradually declining, have plateaued in recent weeks, according to data released by the CDC. Just less than 50% of the U.S. population has been fully vaccinated, despite vaccines being first made available to Americans outside of the medical sector earlier this year."
health,"The CDC relaxed its outdoor mask recommendations for people who are two weeks past their final vaccine shot. The following month, the health agency eased indoor mask-wearing guidance for those fully vaccinated, suggesting they did not need to wear masks inside in most places."
health,"Coronavirus cases started to generally plateau across the U.S. in the days after that last announcement was made. They’ve since risen from a low of 8,059 new daily cases on June 14 to more than 47,000 new daily cases on July 23, according to CDC data."
health,"Then, in early July, vaccinated teachers and students were told they don’t need to wear masks inside school buildings, with the CDC citing a general decline in COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths."
health,"Vaccines reduce the risk of people spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Getting fully vaccinated may not 100% prevent someone from contracting the virus but it will reduce the chance of severe illness or death from the disease, according to the CDC."
health,"As of July, the more transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus makes up the majority of cases in the U.S., rising from an estimated 20% of new cases in late June to 83% of new cases by July 20."
health,"TOKYO (AP) — Tokyo reported 3,177 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, setting an all-time high and exceeding 3,000 for the first time days after the start of the Olympics."
health,"Experts say Tokyo’s surge is being propelled by the new, more contagious delta variant of the virus and there is no evidence of the disease being transmitted from Olympics participants to the general public."
health,"Japan’s seven-day rolling average of cases is about 3.57 per 100,000 people, compared to 17.3 in the United States, 53.1 in Britain and 2.76 in India, according to data from Johns Hopkins University."
health,"Japan’s vaccine minister, Taro Kono, said in an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday that there is no evidence of the coronavirus spreading from Olympic participants to Japan’s population."
health,"Japan has kept its cases and deaths lower than many other countries, but its vaccination campaign started very late in comparison to other large nations and there is fear that rising cases could overwhelm hospitals."
health,"The new cases exceeded the earlier record of 2,848 set the previous day and brought the total for the Japanese capital to 206,745 since the pandemic began early last year."
health,"Nationwide, Japan reported 7,630 cases on Tuesday for a total of 882,823."
health,"Tokyo has been under a fourth state of emergency since July 12 ahead of the Olympics, which began last Friday despite widespread public opposition and concern that they could further worsen the outbreak."
health,"“I don’t think there have been any cases related to the Olympic Games. So we aren’t worried about that issue,” he said."
health,"Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike urged younger people on Wednesday to cooperate with measures to bring down the number of infections and get vaccinated, saying their activities are key to slowing the surge during the Olympics."
health,"“Younger people’s activity holds the key (to slowing the infections), and we need your cooperation,” Koike said. “Please make sure to avoid nonessential outings and observe basic anti-infection measures, and I would like younger people to get vaccinated.”"
health,"Koike noted that the majority of the elderly have been fully vaccinated and infections among them have largely decreased, while mostly unvaccinated younger people are now dominating new cases."
health,"As of Tuesday, 25.5% of the Japanese population has been fully vaccinated. The percentage of the elderly who are fully vaccinated is 68.2%, or 36 million people."
health,"Younger people have been blamed for roaming downtown areas after the requested closing hours for eateries and stores and spreading the virus. The state of emergency, which is to continue through the Olympics, mainly focuses on requiring establishments to stop serving alcohol and shorten their hours. Measures for the public are only requests and are increasingly ignored."
health,"Vaccination prospects for younger people have improved, and some can get their shots organized by work places and colleges, while others still wait based on seniority. But there are also concerns over hesitancy among the young, with surveys showing many have doubts, in part due to false rumors about side effects."
health,"The governors of the three areas, alarmed by Tokyo’s surging cases, said on Wednesday they plan to ask Suga to place their prefectures under the state of emergency too."
health,"Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has also urged people to avoid nonessential outings and says there is no need to consider a suspension of the Games, which are being held with no fans in Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures — Chiba, Kanagawa and Saitama."
health,"OWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) — The coronavirus pandemic is still affecting the Baltimore Ravens. Star quarterback Lamar Jackson tested positive for COVID-19 and missed the team’s first practice of training camp."
health,Coach John Harbaugh announced Jackson’s positive test after practice Wednesday and said running back Gus Edwards also tested positive. He would not go into much more detail about either case or say how long Jackson or Edwards would be out.
health,"“It’s just part of the deal. It’s just the way the world is right now,” Harbaugh said. “We have 90% vaccinated, and I think we’re going to go above that, too, real soon here. So we’re in really great shape with the vaccinations.”"
health,"Jackson missed one game last season, in Week 12, when he also tested positive for the novel coronavirus. That game at Pittsburgh — originally scheduled for Thanksgiving — was postponed three times before it was finally played on a Wednesday in December. The Ravens didn’t practice for over a week, and their number of players on the reserve/COVID-19 list grew to more than 20. They lost that game to the Steelers, then won five in a row to end the regular season."
health,Harbaugh said Jackson tested negative until Tuesday.
health,"“You can obviously get COVID and then get it again,” Harbaugh said. “That’s kind of been demonstrated.”"
health,"Baltimore won a playoff game with Jackson for the first time last season, but the Ravens were then eliminated at Buffalo."
health,"Jackson, who won MVP honors in 2019, is entering his fourth season with Baltimore. He threw for 2,757 yards with 26 touchdowns and nine interceptions last season. He’s also rushed for over 1,000 yards in each of the past two seasons."
health,"There’s been talk this offseason that Jackson, along with fellow 2018 draftees Baker Mayfield and Josh Allen, could be due for a big new contract. Jackson isn’t due to become an unrestricted free agent until 2023, however. So there may not be an urgency to finish an extension."
health,"A more pressing concern is the time he could miss at a crucial training camp. For all of Jackson’s ability, the Ravens finished dead last in 2020 in yards passing per game. Baltimore added more receiving talent in the offseason, acquiring Sammy Watkins and drafting Rashod Bateman in the first round."
health,"Edwards signed a contract extension through 2023 this offseason. He ran for 723 yards last season, helping the Ravens rank first in the NFL in rushing for a second consecutive year."
health,Now the Ravens are without a couple key offensive players.
health,"“I trust every man in the building to take care of one another, so when hiccups like this happen, all we can do is rally around that guy,” receiver Marquise Brown said. “Send our prayers, send our support, and hopefully he’ll be back very soon.”"
health,"As long as his starting quarterback remains out, however, it’s a reminder that COVID-19 can loom over a team’s prospects for the upcoming season."
health,"“We had a tough year. It’s so awesome to be through that — to a pretty good degree,” Harbaugh said. “Not completely, but here we are at least. We’re standing on the patio and we’re talking about training camp practice.”"
health,"“It’s only going to bolster those two guys and make those guys stronger than they would have been otherwise,” Harbaugh said. “That helps our team.”"
health,Tyler Huntley and Trace McSorley combined to throw 15 passes last season for the Ravens.

health,"Miami-Dade County will require all residents to wear masks inside county facilities, effective immediately, amid the surge in COVID-19 cases linked to the highly transmissible delta strain of the coronavirus."
health,"Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said the new mandates come amid an “alarming” rise in COVID-19 case across the region, including an uptick in positive test results and hospitalizations. The Democratic mayor said almost all of the admissions are among unvaccinated residents."

health,"“The facts are clear: The vast majority of those who are now ending up in the hospital due to COVID-19 are unvaccinated, and many are otherwise healthy young people in their 20s, 30s and 40s,” Levine Cava wrote on Twitter. “We have come too far and sacrificed too much to turn back now. Our economy is just beginning to rebound and it’s essential that we build on the progress we have made. We all must do our part to control the spread and to keep our loved ones safe and our community moving forward.” "
health,"Public health officials have stressed that vaccines remain a highly effective measure to prevent severe cases and death associated with COVID-19, even against the delta variant. The director of the CDC, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, has spent the past several weeks describing the current phase of the virus as a “pandemic of the unvaccinated,” releasing troubling statistics showing 97% of hospitalizations are among those who haven’t been protected by a vaccine."
health,"Every state in the nation is seeing a rise in coronavirus cases, despite the country being months into a mass vaccination campaign. A vast majority of those cases, 83% as of last week, are linked to the delta variant, which has upended reopening plans and prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to recommend masks in some regions across the nation again, regardless of vaccination status."
health,"In one of the biggest announcements of its kind, Google told its 140,000-plus employees Wednesday that they must be vaccinated against COVID-19 to return to work in the company’s offices."
health,"Levine Cava added that she strongly recommended “everyone wear masks in large crowds or closed spaces, especially around people that we do not know to be vaccinated.” The mayor also called on businesses to reinstate COVID-19 policies and encouraged those who have yet to get vaccinated to do so."
health,"“Getting vaccinated is one of the most important ways to keep ourselves and our communities healthy in the months ahead,” Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet, Google’s parent company, said in a company-wide email obtained by The New York Times and The Associated Press. "
health,"The company also pushed back its planned return-to-office date from September to mid-October, reflecting growing concern about the delta variant of COVID-19. "
health,"It’s not yet clear how Google will proceed with employees who refuse to be vaccinated, but Pichai said in his email that, so far, it’s been “encouraging to see very high vaccination rates” among Google’s workforce in places where the vaccine is widely available. In Santa Clara County, where Google’s headquarters is located, 77% of people over age 12 are fully vaccinated ― 20% higher than the nation as a whole. "
health,"While several employers have begun announcing vaccine rules for their staffs, Google may now be the biggest to do so. The company operates more than 70 offices in 50 countries and is one of the most influential brands in the tech sector. "
health,"“We recognize that many Googlers are seeing spikes in their communities caused by the Delta variant and are concerned about returning to the office,” Pichai wrote. “This extension will allow us time to ramp back into work while providing flexibility for those who need it.”"
health,"Many conservative lawmakers have pushed back against vaccine mandates, claiming they’re an infringement on personal rights. The argument is a regular fixture on Fox News, where the network’s biggest stars have been casting doubt on the vaccine despite widespread evidence that it’s overwhelmingly safe and effective. "
health,"Daily vaccination rates in the U.S. have plummeted. In mid-April, the U.S. averaged 3.4 million COVID-19 vaccines distributed each day, but that number has seen an 80% decrease in recent weeks, dropping to under 590,000 per day — despite the vaccine being readily available. Meanwhile, there has been an uptick in new cases of the disease, with the largest concentration of outbreaks in states where vaccination rates are low. "
health,Masks are once again required inside the White House and on the House side of the U.S. Capitol after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday recommended that all people wear masks when indoors in high-risk areas to prevent the further spread of COVID-19.
health,The health orders were reimposed roughly a month after mask requirements were lifted for vaccinated individuals inside of the House of Representatives.
health,"Brian Monahan, Congress’ attending physician, said while announcing the new policy that Congress represents “a collection of individuals traveling weekly from various risk areas.” He also said the highly contagious delta variant of the virus has been detected in D.C. and the Capitol buildings."
health,"“Despite the excellent protective value of the coronavirus vaccine in preventing hospitalization and death, there is still a possibility a fully-vaccinated individual could acquire infection in their nose and throat, mild symptoms, or the ability to transmit the coronavirus infection to others,” Monahan said in an email shared by media outlet Punchbowl News."
health,"Coronavirus cases have been rising across the U.S. with the help of the delta variant, which makes up more than 80% of cases, according to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky."
health,"“This pandemic continues to pose a threat to all Americans,” Walensky said Tuesday at a news conference."
health,President Joe Biden said Tuesday that his administration is considering requiring all federal employees to get vaccinated.
health,More than 50 major health care organizations on Monday signed a letter urging health care and long-term care employers require their employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19. They called vaccination “the primary way to put the pandemic behind us and avoid the return of stringent public health measures.” 
health,Warning: This essay includes descriptions of self-harm.
health,"Post-vaccination, I met up with a friend in a park. True to Austin weather, it was hot and humid. Sweat dripped down my back. "
health,"As we chatted, I noticed my friend staring at my left arm at the scars that begin at my wrist and continue up to two inches below my inner elbow crease. During the summer, my skin tans, while the scars on my wrists remain light-colored, appearing even more glossy and raised, like speed bumps. "
health,The worst scar is nested in my elbow crease; it looks a bit like an oblong pill surrounded by faint dots where the stitches used to be. The two large cigarette burns that I made on the back of my left hand have long disappeared. 
health,"Shifting in discomfort, I thought about how every time tank top season arrives, I not only get a bit self-conscious, but also depressed. "
health,"I’m used to my scars, but other people aren’t. I wear long sleeves to cover them; it’s possible to know me for years and not know that I used to cut myself. Long sleeves protect me and, in a way, they protect other people from seeing the sort of violent action I took against my flesh starting at the age of 14. "
health,"For many years, I didn’t know the term “cutting” even existed, despite routinely harming myself. I learned about this variety of self-harm in the ’90s while I was skipping school and watching a daytime talk show. I believe it was “The Maury Povich Show.”"
health,"I took out a safety pin and scratched my skin until a small red bead formed. I was proud for being able to endure pain, to push aside fear, to express myself in a way that wasn’t possible through language. For the first time in a long time, I felt I had power. "
health,"The theme for the episode was teens who listen to “devil-worshiping music.” Pasty white teenagers, wearing black hoodies over their heads, sat next to their concerned parents. They were my age and looked like they could be my friends. "
health,"This was around the time when Tipper Gore and other conservatives were waging a war against rock, rap, metal — any genre they thought was polluting the minds of youth and needed to be censored. "
health,"To prove how “evil” this music was, the producers flashed a Slayer album cover on the screen. It totally shocked me — it depicted the band’s name cut into someone’s forearm. The image was gross, but I wondered: Could I do that to myself?"
health,"Using scissors, a kitchen knife, a razor blade, I regularly began to cut. While I would deny at the time that this was a cry for help, it most certainly was. I wanted the adults in my life to see that I was hurting. "
health,"My father had died a few years previously, and my mother remarried shortly after. My stepfather was an asshole, the sort of guy who told my mother she was stupid. He also had a violent temper and was addicted to drugs, alcohol and hustling money in pool halls. "
health,"My next therapist probably saved my life. She was soft-spoken and smarter than me. During our sessions together, we played Mancala, a two-player board game. Slowly, I started opening up. "
health,"My school counselor sensed that something was up. I stopped going to school, and when I showed up, it was with bandages wrapped around my wrists. I started counseling and my first counselor told me to sign a paper promising that I would talk to someone when I felt like harming myself. She was not the best match for me, and I made cuts that were even deeper. "
health,"I’ve heard that some people cut because they feel completely numb, and seeing that they are capable of bleeding is a reminder that they are alive. I did not feel numb, I felt enraged. "
health,"In a society where girls aren’t allowed to express anger, it’s no surprise that I turned my pent-up fury toward myself. I was deeply afraid, alone, and unable to articulate the trauma that was happening at home. "
health,"When my stepfather broke a restraining order once again, I made a cut in my elbow crease that required stitches. My sisters saw the gory results. My mother shouted, “Get in the car.” We left my sister crying in the driveway. "
health,"My mother drove down the highway like a bat out of hell with her emergency lights blinking. The towel wrapped around my arm was soaked through. I could tell she was both angry and scared. For the first time, I realized that in hurting myself, I was also hurting others. "
health,The doctor who stitched up my arm is someone I’ll never forget. 
health,"“You must be right-handed,” he said. It took me a second to realize that he was making a subtle joke. I looked at my right arm and saw how few scars there were. I told myself I’d have to add to my collection. "
health,“What do you like to do?” he asked. I shrugged. 
health,"“Well, in theory you can write with just one arm, but it might be faster with two.” He mimicked working at a typewriter. "
health,"“I like to write,” I said. "
health,"He had the qualities of a good dad, and before I left, he said, “I don’t want to see you back here again.” I nodded to show I understood."
health,"“Look,” he said. “You keep doing this and you could cause real harm. These fingers of yours might not work as well if you cut too deep.” "
health,"I wish I could say that I never cut again, but that wouldn’t be true. The day I stopped cutting was the day my stepfather died. I was 17. It sounds dark, but I was deeply relieved. My mother, my sister, my brother, myself — we were safe now. His threats couldn’t hang over us anymore. "
health,"Most decent individuals don’t ask for details about my scars. But for longer than I care to reveal, I worked as a barista and it sometimes shocked me what people (always men) felt they had the right to say. "
health,"“Did a cat scratch you? Must be one mean cat.” Another man once asked if I’d been burned by the steam wand. Not waiting for my reply, he answered his own question, “That’s probably it. I imagine those suckers get real hot.” "
health,"“Yep,” I said, nodding. “Barista battle scars.” "
health,"It was sometimes hard for me to tell the difference between rudeness and naiveté. Even amid a busy morning rush, an occasional customer would insist on knowing how I got my scars. "
health,“What happened to your arm?”
health,"My favorite comment came from (no surprise) a teenage boy that I passed on the street in Seattle one day. He turned to his friend and said, “Did you see that girl’s scars? Man, they looked like tiger bites.” I laughed to myself. “Tiger bites,” I kind of liked that. "
health,"One time, though, I told the truth. “I was an unhappy teenager who sucked at suicide.” Things got rather quiet after that. "
health,"My most awkward encounter was with a baby. I was at the grocery store when a toddler in a stroller pointed at me and my arm and said, “Owie.” Trying to get her mother’s attention, she repeated it: “Owie, owie, owie.” "
health,"Tank top season is a time when all of these memories come flooding back; it’s the time when I feel the most vulnerable and exposed. Especially now, when social distancing is coming to an end. "
health,"I was mildly disgusted that he thought the razor marks were some sort of fetish. It made sense he might think that; I lived in Seattle at the time, and knew at least three people with genital piercings. "
health,"Another time, on a crowded New York subway, a man from Africa pointed to my scars and asked what country I was from. He was friendly and remarked that scars were common in the village from where he was from, but he’d never seen anything like mine. He was so open and kind; it was the first time I thought about scarification as a rite of passage. "
health,I had a choice. I could make something up or tell the truth. I usually opted for the former. I’d say that I used to work as a baker and got burned on the oven racks. (Some of the fatter scars do look like burns.) 
health,"I know what people see when they look at the full length of my bare arms, and I know it’s not pretty. "
health,"Some comments I was totally unprepared for, such as the guy who told me he thought my scars were “cool.” He wore black leather pants laced up the side and had a large bull ring through his nose. He was a piercer who’d recently started branding well before I knew that such a thing existed. "
health,"This essay could never be titled “How I Learned to Love My Scars,” because I don’t. I’ve often thought about a tattoo that would cover them but worry that it might also make them more noticeable. "
health,"Her mother knelt down, checking her kid’s finger. Frustrated that her mother didn’t get that she was referring to me and my owie, she started to cry. I felt like a walking human wound. "
health,"What I do love is the fact that I survived. Like most teenagers, what I wanted most was to feel safe and loved. "
health,"In the last year, I’ve become much more accepting of myself and others. If someone were to ask me tomorrow about my scars, instead of telling them to F-off, I think I would tell them the truth: I used to cut myself as a teenager. And if they know of someone who’s in pain there are resources out there to provide help. I do believe that COVID has made people more aware of the mental health crisis we are facing nationwide. I am hopeful that we can heal by being honest about what hurts. "
health,"States that ended protections banning evictions in the spring and summer of 2020 likely led to hundreds of thousands of additional COVID-19 cases and thousands of deaths from the coronavirus, according to a new UCLA study. "
health,"The UCLA researchers found that about four months after evictions were allowed to resume, states saw on average twice as many COVID-19 cases and five times more deaths from the virus. Ending eviction protections, the study estimated, led to some 433,000 excess COVID-19 cases and about 10,000 additional deaths by September 2020."
health,"The study, published Monday in the American Journal of Epidemiology, looked at 43 states that had eviction moratoriums from March to September 2020, and compared COVID-19 cases in those that lifted moratoriums — allowing renters to be evicted — with those that kept protections in place. "
health,"Evictions disproportionately affect people of color, especially women of color. Black and Latinx people are three times as likely to be hospitalized from COVID-19 as white people, and twice as likely to die."
health,"“It’s always important in talking about evictions and housing insecurity to say it’s not something that affects all people equally,” study co-author Kate Leifheit told HuffPost in a November interview. “People of color and low-income folks are at the highest risk of eviction and they’re also at highest risk of negative COVID outcomes.” "
health,Leifheit noted that the increase in cases and deaths associated with eviction would exacerbate existing racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes. 
health,"The COVID-19 pandemic led to massive shuttering of businesses and widespread job losses, leaving millions of people struggling to make rent and vulnerable to eviction. Evictions, in turn, heighten the risk of people contracting COVID-19, as those suddenly without housing often have to double up in others’ homes or go to homeless shelters, where crowding makes it more difficult to socially distance. "
health,"In addition, the threat of eviction may have led some people to continue working in high-risk jobs that exposed them to the virus, the study posited, further increasing the risk of transmission."
health,"In response to the pandemic, many cities and states issued eviction moratoriums in the spring of 2020, but over two dozen states lifted these bans that summer, before vaccines were available. In September 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finally issued a nationwide moratorium on evictions. It’s set to expire at the end of this month."
health,"Over 34 million people in the U.S. have contracted the coronavirus, and more than 610,000 have died. "
health,"While the rate of COVID-19 cases and deaths have plummeted since widespread vaccinations began this spring, in recent weeks there has been a sharp rise in cases, overwhelmingly among people who are unvaccinated, as the highly contagious delta variant spreads. "
health,"With the expiration of the federal eviction moratorium looming, over 13 million renters in the U.S. reported to the U.S. Census Bureau in June that they had “slight” or no confidence in being able to pay this month’s rent. "
health,"With more states considering vaccine requirements for public employees, the president of the AFL-CIO was asked Tuesday whether the labor federation supports vaccine mandates in the workplace."
health,"“Yes, we do,” Richard Trumka said on C-SPAN, responding to a question from a viewer. “If you’re coming back into the workplace, you have to know what’s around you.”"
health,"The remarks from Trumka come at a time when the COVID-19 delta variant is spreading rapidly among the unvaccinated, prompting officials to weigh mandates for workers in order to boost vaccination rates and protect public health. "
health,New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday that the city’s municipal workforce would have to be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the same day that his state’s employees and health care workers would face a similar requirement.
health,The mandates have drawn resistance as well as support from different unions that represent public employees and health care workers.
health,"A union representing New York City paramedics and EMTs, FDNY EMS Local 2507, declared its opposition to de Blasio’s mandate, saying that “the city and the mayor cannot simply disregard the civil liberties of the workforce.” The union said any such requirement should be subject to bargaining."
health,"But a spokesperson for the United Federation of Teachers, which represents most public school teachers in New York City, told The Wall Street Journal that de Blasio’s requirement “puts the emphasis on vaccination but still allows for personal choice and provides additional safeguards through regular testing.”"
health,"In California, a union representing 300,000 health care workers voiced words of support for the state’s mandate. According to Politico, SEIU-UHW called it “a reasonable step to protect the safety and wellbeing of patients and healthcare workers.” "
health,"Last week, however, hospital workers with 1199 SEIU in New York held a rally against a vaccine requirement implemented by New York-Presbyterian Hospital. “Force is not the answer, and a mandate forcing people at the barrel of a gun is not right,” one protesting worker told NY1."
health,"Unions have a responsibility to represent their members, and union members are no different from the general U.S. population: a significant share are not vaccinated. But Trumka said Tuesday that vaccine requirements would help protect everyone at a time when COVID-19 caseloads are increasing once again."
health,"“If you come back and you’re not vaccinated, everybody in that workplace is jeopardized,” Trumka said. “[And] if we don’t know if you’re vaccinated or not, we can’t make the proper accommodations to make sure that you are protected and everybody else is protected.” "
health,A restaurant in the conservative Southern California town of Huntington Beach is demanding that customers prove they’re unvaccinated against the coronavirus as a protest against public health protections.
health,"Notice of the new policy was spelled out in two messages taped to the windows of Basilico’s Pasta e Vino Italian restaurant. “We have zero tolerance for treasonous, anti-American stupidity,” read one."
health,"Customers won’t actually have to produce proofthey’re unvaccinated, since the only official documentation is for people who have gotten their shots, an employee told the Los Angeles Times."
health,"Basilico’s owner, Tony Roman, told the newspaper in an email that he was fighting “tyrants.”"
health,"“With warning signs of another impending lockdown, and many business owners again emboldening those who I refer to as ‘the lockdown tiny tyrants’ — this time by imposing proof-of-vaccination policies — we chose to fire another missile of defiance to further make our point in defense of American liberty and freedom,” Roman said."
health,"The highly transmissible delta variant has sent cases of COVID-19 sharply up across the nation. A Mayo Clinic doctor warned last week that delta will “find everybody not immune.” Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called the new wave the “pandemic of the unvaccinated.”"
health,"Over the last week, California has reported an average of nearly 5,000 new coronavirus cases a day, more than quadruple the number from a month ago, according to the LA Times. "
health,Some businesses in the state are reimposing mask requirements. California is requiring vaccinations or weekly tests for all state employees and some health care workers by early August.
health,"About 55% of people in Orange County, where Basilico’s is located, have been fully vaccinated. They’ll be welcome at lots of other restaurants."
health,"Infections are climbing across the U.S., and mask mandates and other COVID-19 prevention measures are making a comeback in some places as health officials issue increasingly dire warnings about the highly contagious delta variant."
health,"But in a possible sign that the warnings are getting through to more Americans, vaccination rates are creeping up again, offering hope that the nation could yet break free of the coronavirus if people who have been reluctant to receive the shot are finally inoculated."
health,"Vaccinations ticked up over the weekend, with about 657,000 vaccines administered Saturday and nearly 780,000 on Sunday, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The 7-day rolling average on Sunday was about 583,000 vaccinations a day, up from about 525,000 a week prior."
health,"The country will need much higher levels of immunity to crush the resurgent virus — probably 85% to 90%, said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health. The current level stands at about 67%, counting prior infections."
health,"“So we need a lot more vaccinations. Or a lot more infections” and thus more suffering, he said."
health,"Nearly 57% of the country has received at least one vaccine dose, and about 49% of Americans are fully inoculated. The virus has killed almost 611,000 people in the U.S. since the pandemic started."
health,"Meanwhile, some municipal officials are re-imposing some virus rules meant to slow the spread of the disease."
health,"St. Louis on Monday became the second major city to mandate that face masks be worn indoors, regardless of vaccination status, joining Los Angeles in re-imposing the orders."
health,"In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday that all municipal workers — including teachers and police officers — will be required to get vaccinated by mid-September or face weekly COVID-19 testing, making the city one of the largest employers in the U.S. to take such action."
health,The nation’s top infectious diseases expert said federal officials are considering a nationwide recommendation to resume wearing face masks as the once-rosy outlook for a summer return to normalcy seemed to be at risk.
health,"“We’re going in the wrong direction,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, who serves as President Joe Biden’s chief medical adviser, told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “It is really a pandemic among the unvaccinated, which is the reason why we’re out there, practically pleading with the unvaccinated people to go out and get vaccinated.”"
health,Jha shared in Fauci’s frustration.
health,"“For much of winter, spring, I was VERY optimistic we’d have a great summer with few infections, deaths,” he wrote on Twitter. “But (the) situation has clearly turned worse.”"
health,"He said the nation “hit a wall” in its vaccination effort, with just under 50% of the population fully immunized, and the virus’ delta variant proving be more contagious than expected."
health,"“Super contagious variant, lots of unvaccinated folks and more breakthrough infections sets up a tough few months ahead,” Jha said. “We need to break the cycle.”"
health,"Also, some prominent conservative and Republican voices that have spent months casting doubt on the vaccination effort have recently started sounding a different tune."
health,"House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, was among the members of the GOP Doctors Caucus who held a press conference at the Capitol late last week imploring their constituents to lay lingering doubts aside."
health,"The seven-day rolling average for daily new cases in the country shot up over the past two weeks, from more than 19,000 on July 11 to nearly 52,000 on July 25, according to data from Johns Hopkins University."
health,"A week ago, on July 19, Fox News host Sean Hannity declared: “It absolutely makes sense for many Americans to get vaccinated. I believe in science. I believe in the science of vaccinations.”"
health,"And in Tennessee, the brother of a popular local conservative radio host who had been a vaccine skeptic urged listeners to get vaccinated as his brother was in critical care in the hospital battling COVID-19."
health,"“For those listening, I know if he were able to tell you this, he would tell you, ‘Go get vaccinated. Quit worrying about the politics. Quit worrying about all the conspiracy theories,’” Mark Valentine said of his brother, Phil Valentine, Thursday on WWTN-FM in Nashville."
health,"For the past 15 months, most people have been face blind."
health,"With face masks mandatory across much of the world due to COVID-19, facial recognition ― one of the most basic elements of human interaction ― has been stripped from public spaces."
health,"It’s a skill that most people take for granted. It develops in babies before they even learn how to sit upright, and now, suddenly, we’re all expected to get by without it. Some have worked around this, counting on clues and cues based on people’s postures, hair, or the arch of someone’s eyebrows to reveal who is who, but awkwardness and uncertainty are inevitable."
health,"For me, face masks have been a convenient excuse. They can be physically uncomfortable, and I never got used to the fact that when you smile at someone when you’re wearing sunglasses and a mask, it looks like you’re just silently and aggressively staring that person down, but I’ll still miss them when they’re phased out of daily life. That’s because before the pandemic, I regularly offended people I knew by walking past them without acknowledging or stopping them mid-sentence to ask them to (re)introduce themselves. I wasn’t trying to be rude or dismissive; I’m just face blind. "
health,"I didn’t even realize that other people could consistently and thoughtlessly recognize faces until I was 16. I was watching a late night rerun of “The Pyramid” on the Game Show Network with my best friend when she suddenly recognized the celebrity contestant as actress Yvette Nicole Brown, who had played Helen, the movie theater manager, on the early 2000s kids show “Drake & Josh.”"
health,"Face blindness, or prosopagnosia, is a neurological condition that affects a person’s ability to recognize and remember faces. For people with normal facial recognition abilities, it’s difficult to understand what people mean when they say they’re face blind or that they can’t see faces. It’s not face-specific bad eyesight ― I can see you perfectly clearly when we’re together ― but I won’t remember what you look like when you leave. I might remember a remarkable trait, if one appears, but the whole picture of another person’s face never forms in my mind."
health,“You don’t remember Helen?”
health,"“So you just kept that in your head for, like, six years?” I asked, amazed."
health,"“Yeah but I didn’t, like, memorize her face,” I responded."
health,"Having never heard of prosopagnosia, I thought that my friend had some type of photographic memory. Normal people can’t recognize the celebrity contestants on game shows, right? They can’t tell all the bearded white guys on “Game of Thrones” apart, can they? Or spot their teachers and classmates when they’re outside of school? I was sure people could only do that in books and movies to move the plot along."
health,“You don’t really have to memorize faces though ... right? They’re just there?”
health,"In college, I met enough new people in rapid succession to realize I had a problem. I couldn’t place half of them and even when I thought I could, I was frequently wrong."
health,Once I saw a friend sitting a few tables away in the library and I sent him a mock-creepy Snapchat video slowly zooming in on his face as a joke before texting him to come over to where I was sitting and study with me. He replied five minutes later telling me he wasn’t in the library and had no idea whom I’d been filming.
health,"The year after, two different close friends dyed their hair from blond to brown, and I didn’t recognize either until, months later, both of them re-bleached their hair."
health,"Still, I thought I just wasn’t paying enough attention. I was terrible with directions, often got lost, was sometimes a decade off in guessing people’s ages (lower, thankfully), and couldn’t distinguish a Jaguar from a Toyota, so I attributed my trouble with faces to a fundamental impracticality in my personality."
health,"Another time, I even asked about the identity of someone in a group photo my roommate had posted on Facebook, only to find out the mysterious stranger was me."
health,"I finally learned about face blindness during my sophomore year when I heard a radio story about a guy who was so face blind, he couldn’t find his daughter at her high school graduation because she was wearing the same black robe as all the other kids. He also noted that he liked Vin Diesel movies because he always knew which guy Vin Diesel was ― the big and bald one. "
health,"I did not enjoy Vin Diesel movies, but the rest of the face blind guy’s experiences were shockingly familiar. I was also in a constant state of confusion and anxiety in social situations, always afraid I was accidentally snubbing somebody, and often improvising my way through conversations with strange people who seemed to know me."
health,"I never addressed anyone by name unless it was unavoidable, just in case I misidentified them. I was not as severely affected as the man in the interview ― I could usually recognize close friends and family ― but I couldn’t remember acquaintances unless they had very distinct features. (A few years ago, I kept noticing a 7-foot-tall blond guy who had what I thought of as a bird-like face every time I went to a party. Eventually I asked him if he thought it was weird that we kept running into each other. He said no.)"
health,"Looking back, prosopagnosia had been disorienting me for years. As a kid, I would often mix up my own classmates and sometimes couldn’t immediately pick out my own father from a group of men. In an angsty teen journal entry, I wrote that there must be some secret about how to move through the world that everyone else seemed to know except for me. Why was nobody else ever confused like I was? I tried to adopt a Zen attitude toward chaos: Life is soup. "
health,"After hearing about prosopagnosia, I took a test online called the Famous Faces test, in which you have to determine celebrities’ identities based on just their faces. I failed miserably, unable to recognize Elvis, Oprah or Princess Diana. When I called to tell my mom about my revelation that I wasn’t just awkward but appeared to have an actual neurological condition, she casually told me that it made sense, as my dad was also face blind. She said she really thought they must have said something to me about it at some point, but maybe it had just slipped through the cracks."
health,"There is currently no known treatment for face blindness, and while neuroscientists have attempted to create training programs to offset its effects, results have been modest. Those with acquired prosopagnosia, which is face blindness caused by some sort of brain damage, often a stroke or a head injury, showed little to no improvement. Meanwhile, developmental prosopagnosics, who were born with the condition, scored better on facial recognition tests after being taught to measure the space in between facial features, but the results didn’t hold up when the patients were shown those same faces from different angles."
health,"Because of this, I never really saw a point in pursuing an official diagnosis beyond emotional validation. My case has never been debilitating and discovering ways to compensate on my own seemed to be the best option."
health,"Still, learning about prosopagnosia and recognizing my own difficulties with facial recognition has actually helped me to recognize people more easily. I now intentionally memorize people’s distinct features when I meet them, and have had an easier time identifying them later as a result. Most prosopagnosics do this unconsciously to some degree (just as you might have done to identify people in masks during the pandemic), but it’s impossible to be strategic or consistent if you don’t know the problem."
health,"Face blindness is not uncommon, but with only one’s own experience as a frame of reference, it’s often left undiscovered, much less diagnosed, for decades. The late neurologist Oliver Sacks didn’t realize that he was face blind until middle age, despite studying multiple patients with the condition when very little was known about it, writing a book about a related condition, and more than once mistaking his image in mirrored restaurant walls for another man on the opposite side of the restaurant. (I’ve also done this.) "
health,"And it really is a hard problem to recognize. Medically, prosopagnosia remained largely unknown until World War II, when a few wounded soldiers, having miraculously survived bullet wounds to the head, returned home only to find they were unable to recognize their own families. Developmental prosopagnosia took many more years to be accepted in the medical community. "
health,"Sacks was one of the first people to bring the condition into our cultural consciousness through his writing. He attributed other issues he faced ― social awkwardness, introversion, and severe shyness in childhood ― to his face blindness, and connected his bafflingly poor sense of direction, a common but not universal trait in prosopagnosics, to the close connection in the brain between the recognition of faces and that of navigation and general object identification. All of these functions are carried out by the fusiform gyrus, an area at the bottom of the brain controlling various types of recognition which, when abnormal, is also linked to dyslexia and synesthesia."
health,"Along with Sacks, Jane Goodall, Stephen Fry, Chuck Close and Brad Pitt (one of the few actors I could usually recognize when I was younger, because of his blond hair and the fact that his eyes and eyebrows are sort of shaped like coffins) reportedly all suffer from face blindness. Their experiences with it vary. Chuck Close’s severe prosopagnosia inspired some of his most well-known paintings, whereas Brad Pitt’s has mostly just made people think he was an asshole who couldn’t be bothered to remember the plebs. Goodall (whose face blindness extends to chimps) describes prosopagnosia in her memoir as “curiously humbling,” which, though optimistic, is accurate. "
health,"While the rest of the world will hopefully soon be restored to a maskless state of instant face recognition, those of us with face blindness (along with the unfortunate woman who reportedly developed prosopagnosia and navigation impairment as a result of COVID-19) will still be contending with our constant and innate reminder of how vast and bizarre this world is. "
health,"Face blindness is deeply uncomfortable, but it does give you a certain sense of perspective. It forces you to notice details and actively engage with the world around you. It also makes you far more at ease with uncertainty. This approach to life is one I think many people have been forced to contend with during the past year and a half of mask-wearing. I’m not saying this circumstantial removal of facial recognition was some sort of great equalizer, but I do believe it made people pause and more closely observe what was happening around them before passing judgment, and it maybe even disrupted some of their assumptions about others."

health,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) accused a Georgia restaurant of segregation over the weekend, only to get schooled by Twitter users who pointed out that she didn’t understand the meaning of the word."
health,"On Sunday, the Republican firebrand attacked the Atlanta-based Argosy after the restaurant said it would refuse service to unvaccinated customers."
health,"Only about 45% of the Peach State’s population is fully vaccinated. Increasing vaccination rates would help stem the rise of COVID-19 cases, but Greene seemed less than interested in promoting public health in her home state."
health,"Instead, she rhetorically asked whether the restaurant would also be “testing everyone at the door for the flu, strep throat, stomach bugs, colds, meningitis, aids, venereal diseases, Hep A, Hep C, staff infections [SIC], athletes foot, pink eye, croup, bronchitis, ringworm, scabies, or any other contagions?”"
health,Her definition of “segregation” was just as confusing as the claim she made last week that asking her if she’s been vaccinated violated her HIPAA rights.
health,"Merriam-Webster defines “segregation” as “the separation or isolation of a race, class, or ethnic group by enforced or voluntary residence in a restricted area, by barriers to social intercourse, by separate educational facilities, or by other discriminatory means.” It does not mean “the act of protecting people from becoming infected with a deadly virus.”"

health,"Californians who work for the state, in health care, or in a handful of other high-risk settings will be required to show proof they have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing, the governor announced Monday."
health,"The policy will take effect for state employees on Aug. 2. Staffers at what the state has deemed “high-risk congregate settings” have until Aug. 9 to get their shots, while employees at health care facilities will have until Aug. 23."
health,"“Congregate settings” include adult and senior residential facilities, homeless shelters and jails ― all of which have struggled to stymie COVID-19 outbreaks."
health,"The order affects upward of 2.25 million people. The state employs at least 238,000 people, and about 2 million work in the public and private health care sector, according to The Associated Press. "
health,"“We are now dealing with a pandemic of the unvaccinated, and it’s going to take renewed efforts to protect Californians from the dangerous Delta variant,” Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said in a statement. “As the state’s largest employer, we are leading by example and requiring all state and health care workers to show proof of vaccination or be tested regularly, and we are encouraging local governments and businesses to do the same.”"
health,"The announcement comes as the delta variant of the coronavirus gains traction around the U.S., particularly in California. Los Angeles County reinstated its indoor mask mandate for all citizens, regardless of their vaccination status, as delta cases began to spike earlier this month. "

health,"Cases are rising in Dallas, Baltimore, St. Louis and Las Vegas, according to NBC."
health,The variant is frightening Amazon workers just as health policies at work are being relaxed.
health,The increase comes as new cases of COVID-19 rise across the nation and the more transmissible delta variant surges to the forefront of outbreaks.
health,"“That’s what most of us are worried about,” a Baltimore worker told NBC. “They’re lifting everything and it’s like they don’t care that there’s another variant out. They don’t care that people don’t have to get a vaccine and are working right next to us.”"
health,For nearly two months Amazon has allowed employees to work maskless if they’re fully vaccinated and can prove it. Other protocols are also being eased.
health,The worker added: “We really don’t know what to do. We’re doing our best because most of us have bills we have to pay.”

health,"For Lucy, a 59-year-old metastatic breast cancer patient from Washington state, getting vaccinated against COVID-19 was a matter of life and death. After undergoing aggressive chemotherapy for months, the coronavirus almost certainly would have killed her. Yet as relief washed over her upon receiving her final Pfizer dose in March, she knew she’d have to keep it to herself. Her husband had begged her not to get the shot."
health,"At the outset of the pandemic, Lucy’s husband and partner of seven years, Shane, was as cautious as anyone about the virus. He kept a big container of hand sanitizer in the car and fanatically washed his hands, keys and other items. He wore a face mask everywhere he went, showered and changed his clothes immediately upon returning home from necessary outings, and was anxious for Lucy and her elderly mother, who lives with them, to get vaccinated as soon as possible due to their heightened vulnerabilities."
health,"But as the crisis dragged on, 60-year-old Shane spent months cooped up inside on YouTube and Facebook, where a vortex of coronavirus conspiracy theory videos was waiting for him. Many declared that the virus was nothing to fear — that it was the vaccines he should really be afraid of. Before long, he was also tuning into the increasingly malicious disinformation networks Newsmax and OAN, which regularly rehashed the lies he’d been fed online. He was completely enthralled, Lucy said, and over time, his worldview “did a 180.” "
health,"Among other delusions, Shane is now steadfastly convinced that the COVID-19 outbreak was orchestrated by government-allied forces, the coronavirus is no more harmful than the flu, and the vaccines alter recipients’ DNA — condemning them to slowly perish. "
health,"Shane also believes that those who’ve been vaccinated can “shed” deadly toxins onto unvaccinated people in their vicinity. He fled the house when one of Lucy’s vaccinated adult sons from her previous marriage came to visit around Memorial Day of this year. Since returning more than a week afterward, he has confined himself to the basement and insisted that Lucy’s children never come back, lest they “shed.”"
health,He still doesn’t know Lucy is immunized; she hides her vaccine card in a safety deposit box.
health,"“Everything fell apart last year,” said Lucy, who also snuck her mother out to get her shots behind Shane’s back. “I don’t even know who he is anymore.” "
health,"Shane is among the millions of Americans who have fallen prey to the coronavirus “infodemic” — the maelstrom of false and misleading information about COVID-19 that has gone viral during the pandemic, drastically hindering the nation’s recovery. Hyper-politicized anti-vaccine propaganda has reached countless U.S. households — largely by way of Fox News, far-right media outlets, GOP lawmakers and right-wing influencers — as terrifying conspiracy theories about the vaccines’ supposed lethality and nefarious development spread like wildfire across social media. "
health,"The COVID-19 vaccines have become a symbol of America’s culture wars, and the consequences are deadly. More than 99% of coronavirus-related deaths in the U.S. occur among unvaccinated people, yet even though the shots have been widely available in all 50 states for months, nearly half the population hasn’t received a single dose. "
health,"Lucy’s story may only be unusual in the sense that she still got the vaccine — making the logical decision to protect herself against a virus that has killed more than 600,000 Americans — despite her family pressures. For many in her position, the choice to betray a loved one’s trust in order to prioritize their own health isn’t easy, and may come at a great personal cost. "
health,"Research shows that social relationships may play a key role in keeping some people from getting vaccinated. In May, the American Enterprise Institute’s Survey Center on American Life found only 28% of Republicans reported receiving any encouragement from family and friends to get the vaccine, and more — 1 in 3 — reported actually being discouraged by friends and family, or receiving mixed messages. Only 45% of Republicans have received at least one vaccine dose, compared to 86% of Democrats."
health,"HuffPost talked to five men and women whose marriages are crumbling or have already collapsed under the weight of viral anti-vaccine disinformation. Most said they did their best to tolerate their spouses’ embrace of conspiracy theories amid the pandemic — until it came to the vaccines, when those delusions suddenly posed a direct threat to their well-being or that of their children. All were pressured by their partners not to get immunized (though most managed to do so in secret anyway), and are identified by pseudonyms to protect their families’ privacy. Three, including Lucy, are now in the process of getting divorced."
health,"“I don’t understand what happened to him,” Lucy said of Shane. “But I choose my health.”"
health,The Q Factor
health,"As the coronavirus swept across the U.S., so did QAnon, with anti-vaccine hysteria emerging center stage in its extraordinary fear-mongering campaign. The far-right conspiracy theory movement hinges upon the belief that former President Donald Trump has quietly been at war against an omnipotent cabal of “deep-state” pedophiles who do all kinds of wicked things — from eating children to unleashing a highly infectious virus to manufacture a global need for a secretly deadly vaccine. (The latter is all part of a mass depopulation scheme cooked up by billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates and his fellow cabal members, of course.)"
health,"QAnon rode COVID-19 to new heights, conjuring up its own twisted narratives behind the pandemic while exploiting the widespread fear and uncertainty to indoctrinate more people. A staggering 15% of Americans have adopted the movement’s core beliefs, according to recent polling by the Public Religion Research Institute. For many, QAnon’s wild anti-vaccine conspiracy theories have left them completely petrified."
health,"Carrie, a woman in her mid-40s who lives in the Southwest, met Anthony 12 years ago. They had a lot in common: Both had young children from earlier marriages, were around the same age and were generally fun, friendly and easy-going people. They married three years later."
health,"Anthony was a Trump supporter but had never been very politically engaged, nor had he ever shown any interest in conspiracy theories. That changed in February of this year when he tested positive for COVID-19 and was almost entirely unaffected. During the two weeks he spent in complete isolation post-diagnosis, he heard repeatedly on social media that the virus wasn’t actually killing people and that the death tolls had been fabricated — QAnon theories that seemed to be supported by his own mild, cold-like symptoms. (It’s common for coronavirus cases to be mild or asymptomatic.) "
health,"Up until that point, the entire family had been very cautious about COVID-19, and Anthony began to feel foolish for having been so afraid. It was the catalyst for his nosedive down the Q rabbit hole, where he absorbed all kinds of QAnon falsehoods. Soon, he was telling Carrie and the kids that President Joe Biden and his cronies had stolen the election from Trump, there was a Democrat-run child sex ring under the White House, the pandemic was a hoax, and everyone who got any of the COVID-19 vaccines would be dead within two years."
health,"“I think my husband has lost his mind,” said Carrie, who tried tirelessly to debunk his delusions until she eventually accepted that no amount of logic or evidence would sway him. “How does someone go from being a normal human to being so crazy?”"
health,"It’s a question that families across the country are asking about their loved ones who rattle off conspiracy theories when explaining why they refuse to get vaccinated against the coronavirus. Conspiratorial narratives about the supposedly malicious interests of key figures and institutions surrounding vaccines are now causing just as much vaccine skepticism as safety concerns are, according to a report from First Draft, a global nonprofit that researches misinformation."
health,"Carrie didn’t understand how her husband could buy into these anti-vaccine delusions while still supporting Trump, whose administration launched Operation Warp Speed, a COVID-19 vaccine development and distribution program. Trump has also strongly encouraged Americans to go out and get immunized. Anthony’s explanation was mind-boggling."
health,"“Trump is lying because he’s trying to take down this global cabal of pedophiles and he’s just trying to throw us off,” Carrie recalled him telling her — a refrain repeated widely in QAnon circles. “It’s so we don’t see what he’s really doing because he’s trying to save the world.”"
health,"Anthony wept when he learned that Carrie had snuck out to get vaccinated, convinced not only that his wife was doomed to die in the near future, but also, bizarrely, that she’d been injected with HIV. He wouldn’t have sex with her until she got tested for the disease and showed him her negative result. He broke down again when she later informed him that she’d taken her eligible biological children to get their vaccines, then sent her a written notice explicitly threatening to divorce her if she ever got their shared eight-year-old daughter immunized against the virus."
health,"“He thinks I’m murdering our kids. He believes it hook, line and sinker — I don’t know how he makes it through the day,” said Carrie, who told him, sarcastically, “At least you’ll be alive for the remaining children.” By then, Anthony had latched onto the “shedding” theory. "
health,"“We’ll all be dead, too,” he replied."
health,"“I had even tossed out to her, ‘Have you talked to one of our doctors about it face-to-face, taking social media out of it?’” recalled Harrison, who secretly got his Moderna shots in March and April. “But she thinks the doctors are in on it, that they’re part of Big Pharma and they’re working together behind the COVID ‘hoax.’ That’s what she hears online over and over and over again.” "
health,"For Harrison, a 52-year-old husband and father from Michigan, social media is a tool to stay connected with friends and family from afar, and has been especially useful through the COVID-19 lockdowns. To Fiona, his wife of 20 years, it has become her go-to source for news — and medical advice. "
health,Inside The Anti-Vaccine Echo Chamber
health,"One of QAnon’s greatest and most damaging accomplishments has been eroding the public’s trust in legitimate information sources at a time of crisis. Building off Trumpworld’s crusade against the “fake news media,” its network of disinformation spreaders has successfully painted the mainstream media, liberal politicians and government institutions including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as corrupt and unreliable. As a result, people have increasingly turned to social media platforms to get their news, where grifters abound and facts don’t matter. "
health,"Much of Fiona’s day is spent on YouTube, where an echo chamber of QAnon influencers and other far-right conspiracy theorists fill her head with baseless claims of corruption behind the “plandemic” and warn her about the supposed dangers of the coronavirus vaccines. Pointing to videos on the platform and other social media sites, including Facebook, Instagram, Parler and Bitchute, she has told Harrison that the virus is nothing serious and the shots are used to inject people with some kind of poison. His attempts to steer her toward credible sources have been futile, and he often finds himself wondering how long they can go on like this."
health,"Social media has been a breeding ground for coronavirus conspiracy theories, with platforms not only hosting disinformation but actively driving users toward it via algorithmic recommendations while turning a profit. “Plandemic,” a conspiracy theory film in which a widely discredited medical researcher called vaccines “a money-making enterprise that causes medical harm” and suggested they will “kill millions,” racked up millions of views across social platforms almost overnight last May. "
health,"Anti-vaccine hysteria can be especially lucrative for opportunistic hucksters who shill supposed immunity-boosting alternatives, information packages and coronavirus “cures” on social media — and who often benefit from algorithmic amplification and sometimes earn a cut of the ad revenue they generate. Just 12 influencers are responsible for nearly two-thirds of anti-vaccine content across social media, according to a report from the Center for Countering Digital Hate."
health,"In the online attention economy, the more polarizing a post is — like the anti-vaccine propaganda that Shane, Anthony and Fiona have been binging to the dismay of their spouses — the more likely it is to drive high engagement. Platforms notoriously reward such content by further boosting its visibility, which can keep users active longer and increase their exposure to ads. This may not seem like a big deal for flat Earth-type conspiracy theories, but with vaccine-related disinformation, the stakes are extraordinarily high."
health,"Fiona, 51, is overweight, and Harrison worries about what might happen to her if she catches COVID-19. They have a nine-year-old son together, and he has started repeating his mother’s falsehoods. But if Fiona got sick, only then, Harrison suspects, would she realize that the “intel” she consumes on social media is nonsense."
health,"“There’s gonna be no convincing her until it affects her directly,” he said of his wife. “I just hope it doesn’t come to that.”"
health,"While Rick’s vaccine beliefs are extreme and ludicrous, the underlying current of fear and suspicion is regularly reinforced on his TV screen. His media diet includes Fox News, OAN and Newsmax, whose hosts have likened vaccine passports to racial segregation, denigrated door-to-door vaccine efforts as “creepy,” declared that the Biden administration’s focus on vaccination is “mind-boggling” and argued that vaccines are “against nature.” The effect is clear: Just 3 in 10 people who watch Newsmax or OAN are “vaccine accepters,” according to a study from PRRI."
health,Mainstreaming Vaccine Hysteria
health,"For the past several months, Hannah’s home has been a literal anti-vax megaphone. Her husband, Rick, has set up speakers around the exterior to blast COVID-19 vaccine conspiracy theory videos out to neighbors, passersby and anyone who will listen. A hard-line Christian conservative, he’s been known to do public Bible readings in an effort to convert people, but lately, he’s been preaching coronavirus trutherism to turn them into anti-vaxxers."
health,"That was when Rick, like so many other Americans, suddenly decided the coronavirus shots contained secret location-tracking microchips and were designed to kill people en masse. When his wife mentioned that she was planning to get vaccinated, he threatened divorce."
health,"“Not only does he not want me to get [the vaccine], he wants me to tell everyone I know not to get it,” said Hannah, who secretly got her Pfizer shots on her way to pick the girls up from day care in April and May. “I sat there thinking to myself, ‘I guess I’m getting divorced.’”"
health,"He wasn’t always like this. Hannah, 38, met Rick when she was a senior in high school. He was four years older, and at six-foot-two, he towered over her with more than a foot between them. She liked his blue-green eyes and the way he dressed, like he was in a boy band. They married a few years later and now live on the West Coast with their two daughters, who are 9 and 5. Both received all of their regular childhood vaccines and annual flu shots — until the pandemic hit."
health,"“If we had had the pushback for vaccines the way we’re seeing on certain media, I don’t think it would have been possible at all to not only eradicate smallpox, we probably would still have smallpox and we probably would still have polio in this country,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious-disease expert, recently told CNN."
health,But it’s not just right-wing media outlets that are ushering anti-vaccine propaganda into the mainstream. Republican lawmakers are also normalizing baseless vaccine skepticism. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) dubbed Biden’s vaccine staff “needle Nazis”; Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) compared them to Hitler’s “brownshirts.”
health,"Hannah suspects this only reaffirms Rick’s views, which have grown increasingly alarming."
health,"“Last night [Rick] sent me a video about the vaccine and how it has aborted fetuses in it, I said I didn’t believe it,” she wrote in her online journal in December. “He said if I take the vaccine I could pack my bags and leave his kids here.”"
health,"Rick’s anti-vax delusions have been a “breaking point” for their relationship. Hannah is overweight and her daughters have lung and heart issues; all three are at high risk for complications from COVID-19. She wants to get the girls vaccinated as soon they’re eligible, but knows Rick would never be OK with it — and it would be impossible to hide from him."
health,"As James rolled up his sleeve and felt the pinch of his first Pfizer shot in early April, he knew his marriage was over. "
health,"“He cares about people, he really does. He has a good heart,” she said. “But I want to be separated so that I can get [my daughters] a vaccine.” "
health,‘He Lost Me’
health,"“I loved her completely,” James said. “My theory was that if I loved her enough and supported her, she’d come back.”"
health,"His wife, Alina, had been fiercely opposed to vaccines since watching the viral 2016 anti-vaccine film “Vaxxed,” which pushes the debunked lie that vaccines cause autism. But over the past three years, as she became engrossed with QAnon conspiracy theories on YouTube, in private Facebook groups and elsewhere on social media, her reasons for hating vaccines became increasingly irrational. She’d send him hundreds of videos and articles claiming vaccines were part of a sinister plot to establish a new world order, and he’d stay up for hours into the night doing research to disprove them. It never made a difference."
health,"“The day I figured out I definitely had to go was when I was sneaking out to get my vaccine and felt like it would have been better had I been seeing another woman,” said the 54-year-old Washington state resident. “I couldn’t believe it was something I had to hide.”"
health,"During the pandemic, Alina started protesting against the lockdowns and vaccines — unconcerned about contracting the virus — and refused to let her teenage sons from a previous marriage go back to school when in-person classes resumed because she was afraid that face masks, which were mandated, would harm them. "
health,"She moved into their family cabin in the woods, where she would host anti-vaccine meetups with dozens of people, so she could grow a vegetable garden, raise chickens and stockpile food to prepare for “the end times.” James’ children, also from a previous marriage, were increasingly embarrassed by their stepmother."
health,"To James, it felt like the sweet, caring woman he’d fallen in love with was turning into a stranger before his eyes, and he was losing hope of ever breaking through to her. They filed for divorce in late April, weeks after James got his first vaccine dose behind Alina’s back."
health,"Soon after filing, James confessed via text to getting the shot."
health,"“We had no future indeed,” Alina replied."
health,"“She lost a partner who cared greatly for her,” James said. “One of our last arguments was, ‘Are you really going to throw all this away for these unsupported theories?’ Basically, she responded that she’s willing to die for this. That made it a lot easier to walk away.”"
health,"For Lucy, the metastatic breast cancer patient, her husband’s blind faith in baseless anti-vaccine conspiracy theories is also what pushed her to pursue divorce. Shane, like Alina, believes the vaccine is lethal and did everything in his power to prevent Lucy from getting it, even as her cancer treatment grew more aggressive, devastating her immune system. "
health,"“He says I can’t get vaccinated because he doesn’t want to lose me,” Lucy said of her soon-to-be ex. “He lost me anyway.”"
health,More than 50 major health care organizations have signed a letter urging health care and long-term care employers to require their employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19 as cases begin to rise again across the U.S.
health,"“We call for all health care and long-term care employers to require their employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19,” the organizations said in the letter published Monday. The American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Physicians are among the groups that signed on to the letter. "
health,"The groups cited the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus, which has been spreading among unvaccinated people, for the recent surge in new COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths across the U.S."
health,"“Vaccination is the primary way to put the pandemic behind us and avoid the return of stringent public health measures,” the letter states. “Unfortunately, many health care and long-term care personnel remain unvaccinated.”"
health,"About 25% of hospital workers who work directly with patients had not received even one COVID-19 vaccine shot as of May, according to a WebMD and Medscape Medical News data analysis of 2,500 hospitals across the country. "
health,"Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, the vice provost for global initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania who organized the group statement, said health care workers had an “ethical duty to put patients’ health and well-being first.” "
health,"“Employer vaccine mandates are effective and lifesaving, and they are especially appropriate in health care and long-term care settings,” he said in a separate statement Monday. “No patient should have to worry that they could become infected by one of their care providers, and no provider should put their patient at risk.” "
health,Coronavirus cases have been rising across the U.S. in recent weeks while vaccination rates plateau.
health,"Vaccines reduce the risk of people spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Getting fully vaccinated may not guarantee that someone won’t contract the virus, but it will reduce the chance of severe illness or death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
health,"Hospital workers, including at institutions in New Jersey and Texas, have been fired for refusing to comply with their employer’s coronavirus vaccine mandate."
health,"More than 100 workers filed a lawsuit in May against Houston Methodist Hospital in Texas over its vaccine requirement. A federal judge tossed out the suit in June, and employees who refused to comply with the vaccine mandate were fired."
health,"In 2008, I’d popped in to see a friend at a table read (that’s where the cast of a play, TV show, or film sits around a table and reads the entire script out loud) and was invited to sit in until the star of the show arrived. Moments later, an effervescent 16-year-old stunner strode into the conference room, wearing a black leather jacket and biker boots."
health,"I didn’t know who they were then, but the moment they smiled and said hello, I felt the molecules in the room change. "
health,The show was a Disney pilot called “Sonny With a Chance.” That star was Demi Lovato.
health,"Four months after that table read, I would check myself into a drug and alcohol treatment center with what I now understand was remarkably progressed alcoholism. I’d been drinking and using around the clock and found myself unable to be the mother that my kids deserved."
health,"I’d tried everything ― just drinking and leaving pills alone, then taking pills without drinking. I tried different drugs (Ativan, Klonopin, Valium) and different drinks (beer, wine, vodka). I tried limiting my drinking to certain hours, but that only worked for a day or two. (“It must be five o’clock somewhere,” I’d reason.)"
health,"As Robin Williams once famously said, “I was violating my standards quicker than I could lower them.” "
health,"I swore on my children several times that I would only take pills at bedtime, but morning after morning, I would find myself drunk or high, wondering how it had happened again. "
health,"Thirty days later, I walked out of that treatment center, terrified, humiliated and sober. I still thought it was unfathomable that I would never again be able to have a glass of Champagne at a friend’s wedding or accept a much-needed Xanax from a friend if I was stressed out. "
health,"But I’d chosen 12-step recovery (though I didn’t even know that there were other types of recovery at the time). And in 12-step recovery, the mandate is unambiguous ― you may ingest nothing that alters you from the neck up without changing your sobriety date."
health,"For me, that meant no more NyQuil when I had a cold, no occasional leftover Vicodin when I had a killer headache, no more trendy fermented drinks that listed a 0.5% alcohol content."
health,"When people ask me if I ever think about “loosening up a little” and maybe trying a little cannabis for sleep or a glass of wine when we’re on vacation, I usually say something like this: “I’m not willing to risk my sobriety, because I don’t know what might awaken that monster that kept me from my kids.”"
health,"Three years after that table read, a 19-year-old Demi Lovato, who recently came out as nonbinary and uses they/them pronouns, checked into treatment for the first time (there have been several since then). In the following years, I watched with interest as talk show host after talk show host documented their heroin-induced strokes and heart attack, along with their struggles with depression, substance use, self-harm, bullying and bulimia. Eventually, I felt like it was all too much."
health,"“Leave that poor child alone,” I thought. “Let them find their way in peace.” "
health,"But I sat up and took notice in March of this year, when Lovato declared themselves something called “California sober.”"
health,"“I’ve learned that shutting a door on things makes me want to open the door even more,” Lovato said in their docuseries, “Demi Lovato: Dancing With the Devil.” “I’ve learned that it doesn’t work for me to say ‘I’m never gonna do this again.’”"
health,"Instead of practicing total abstinence like in traditional recovery, being “California sober” usually means a recovering addict uses certain drugs, like weed and alcohol, in moderation. The “complete abstinent method isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution for everybody,” Demi said during an interview with “CBS Sunday Morning” that aired in March."
health,"This is coming up again now because Lala Kent of “Vanderpump Rules” was recently quoted on the “Behind the Velvet Rope” podcast as saying, “Being California sober is not a real thing. You’re not sober ... If you are drinking or you’re smoking weed, you’re not sober.”"
health,I have to say that I agree with her.
health,"I don’t have any issues with someone who has struggled with substance or alcohol use disorder and has decided that they’d like to smoke weed. Honestly, what anyone chooses to do with their bodies isn’t any of my business. I do, however, take issue with labeling that state of being as “sober,” California or otherwise."
health,"Moreover, I believe that people for whom recovery does need to be black and white might get into trouble while trying to do things the Demi Lovato way. What addict wouldn’t fasten on to the idea (with glee) that they can drink and smoke weed like a normal person and still be “sober”? And how many addicts might die while trying to achieve something that won’t ever work for them?"
health,"The addict who puts down their drug of choice but still uses marijuana may be playing with fire. According to one study, “Among individuals in alcohol treatment, any cannabis use (compared with none) is related to a significantly lower percentage of days abstinent from alcohol post‐treatment.” In other words, those people who used any cannabis at all were “sober” for less time."
health,"It usually starts off innocently enough. A person in recovery will take few hits of weed or have a drink one or two and think, “Maybe I’m better now; this isn’t so bad after all.” In my experience, people who abandon their 12-step recovery to try other methods such as “mindful drinking” or “moderation management” often come back in worse shape than before. "
health,"Not only can using another substance lead an addict back to their original substance of choice, there’s also the danger of transferring addictions. A girlfriend of mine wanted to try moderating, so she put down her drug habit in her 20s but found by age 35 she was basically mainlining booze instead, drinking two quarts of vodka per day. "
health,"For many of us, our addiction issues are less about specific substances than our inherent need to treat our problems with whatever chemical solution happens to be available. "
health,"But I also want to be mindful that the only sobriety I can judge is my own. I have a woman in my life who, like Lovato, almost died several times of heroin overdoses. But now, just two years after her last stint in the neuro-ICU, she has an occasional drink and hit of weed without experiencing any negative consequences. But, unlike Lovato, she’ll be the first one to tell you that she does not consider herself to be “sober.” "
health,"And while I ponder the concept of harm reduction (accepting that not everyone is ready or capable of giving up their substance use at a given time) just for a moment, I wonder what would have happened to me if, when I was trying to get sober in 2008, someone had said, “Hey! You don’t have to give up everything. You can still drink in moderation.”"
health,"I mean, if I could have drunk or used in moderation, I certainly would have. The truth is that for me and others like me, recovery is an all-or-nothing proposition. I’m convinced that I’d be dead if I hadn’t gotten “regular” sober when I did."
health,"I’m not mad at Demi Lovato. I knew that they were special the moment they walked into that room 13 years ago, and I’m still a fan. I also understand that recovery is not one-size-fits-all, and besides 12-step recovery, there are many, many pathways to restore yourself, to get well and whole again. "
health,"I guess I’d just like to let anyone who is dealing with an addiction know if, like me, you are not someone who is capable of moderating the amount of drugs in your system at any given time, there is help out there to get “regular” sober."
health,"Total abstinence can sound scary when you’ve become dependent on substances, but I’m proof that there is freedom on the other side. "
health,President Joe Biden on Monday marked the 31st anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act by announcing guidance that extends its protections to people with “long COVID.”
health,"Biden laid out the plan in a Rose Garden speech alongside Vice President Kamala Harris, hailing the act ― which he co-sponsored as a senator in 1990 ― as a “bulwark against discrimination and a path to independence.”"
health,"“The ADA is more than a law,” he said. “It’s a testament to our character as a people, our character as Americans.”"
health,"With the signing of the proclamation Monday, COVID-19 long-haulers whose lingering symptoms rise to the level of a disability will have civil rights protections under the ADA."
health,A joint memo issued by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Justice Department enumerates some of the symptoms of long COVID while emphasizing the list is not exhaustive. 
health,The agencies also caution that long COVID is not always a disability and must rise to the level of “substantially limiting” a major life activity in order to qualify.
health,"“Many Americans who seemingly recover from the virus still face lingering challenges like breathing problems, brain fog, chronic pain and fatigue,” Biden said. “These conditions can sometimes rise to the level of a disability.”"
health,"New York City will require municipal workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19 by mid-September, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday. Those who don’t will have to take weekly tests instead."
health,"“We’re bringing agencies together to make sure Americans with long COVID who have a disability have access to the rights and resources that are due under the disability law,” he added. “Which includes accommodations and services in the workplace and school, and our health care system, so they can live their lives in dignity and get the support they need as they continue to navigate these challenges.”"
health,"The policy, which will apply to roughly 340,000 city employees, including police officers, teachers and firefighters, dovetails with a broader push for vaccine mandates in the city as the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus sparks renewed national concern."
health,"Workers will have to show proof of vaccination by Sept. 13, the first full day of school in the city. Those who decline will have to get tested once a week, de Blasio said. Unvaccinated city staffers who work indoors will also have to wear a face mask at all times."
health,"The mayor also urged private companies to follow the city’s lead and implement vaccine mandates of their own when possible, noting they have more freedom to “set their own rules” than the government."
health,"“Either get vaccinated, which is far preferable, or get tested once a week,” the mayor said at a press conference rolling out the policy. “This is about our recovery. This is about what we need to to do bring back New York City. This is about keeping people safe. This is about making sure our families get through COVID OK. This is about jobs, you name it.”"
health,"Monday’s announcement follows a similar mandate for employees at city-run hospitals and health clinics, set to take effect at the beginning of August."
health,"As of Monday, 71% of adults in the city have received at least one dose of the vaccine."
health,"ATLANTA (AP) — The largest city on Georgia’s coast has reimposed a requirement that people wear masks in public, citing a “steep and alarming rise” in cases of COVID-19."
health,"Savannah Mayor Van Johnson made the announcement Monday at a news conference, saying people now must wear masks any time they are indoors with people who are not members of their immediately families."
health,"Johnson said his order does not apply to schools and colleges, but called on them to do the same, saying rates of COVID-19 have roughly tripled in Chatham County in the last two weeks."
health,"The county saw a big spike in new cases at the end of last week, according to state Department of Public Health data, pushing transmission rates to levels last seen in March. Reported new cases are roughly nine times where they were when they bottomed out in late June."
health,"Johnson said the delta variant of COVID-19, low vaccination rates and large gatherings over the July 4 holiday may be contributing to the rise."
health,Statewide case rates in Georgia are almost five times as high as they were in late June. 
health,"“Many people have just let their guard down,” Johnson said. “They’ve stopped masking, they’ve stopped social distancing regardless of vaccination status.”"
health,"Savannah was the first Georgia city to impose a mask mandate last year. In May, it dropped the requirement but advised unvaccinated people and medically vulnerable people to keep wearing masks."
health,"“None of us want to take a backward step in our return to normalcy, but wearing a masks is the simple, easy, most inexpensive thing we can do to protect ourselves and those around us,” the first-term mayor said."
health,"For now, Johnson said the city will allow large outdoor events to continue, as long as organizers take safety precautions."
health,"As of Thursday, 46% of Chatham County residents had received at least one dose of a vaccine, just above Georgia’s 45% rate. People 12 and older are eligible to be vaccinated."
health,"“Are we effectively punishing those who did the right thing, who took the vaccine? And the answer is yes, we probably are,” Johnson said. “But the minority is being punished because of the inaction of the majority.”"
health,"“In Colorado, we expect to have fleas test positive for plague during the summer months,” said Jennifer House, deputy state epidemiologist and public health veterinarian for CDPHE. “While it’s rare for people to contract plague, we want to make sure everyone knows the symptoms.”"
health,"Health officials in Colorado are asking people to take precautions after plague was detected in six counties, including where a 10-year-old girl recently died from causes associated with the infectious disease, which can turn serious if not immediately treated."
health,"The Colorado Department of Public Health & Environment (CDPHE) announced Thursday the rise of laboratory-confirmed cases among samples of fleas and mammals, which is not unusual during this time of year."
health,"Fleas were collected from the county for testing after residents reported that a prairie dog colony had gone silent and was no longer visible, The Colorado Sun reported. According to CDPHE, prairie dogs are very susceptible to plague and are good indicators of the disease if they suddenly disappear."
health,"In La Plata County, in the southwest corner of the state, laboratory tests confirmed a fourth grader who reportedly raised hogs died on July 5 from illness associated with plague. Her official cause of death could not be confirmed until additional testing was completed, The Durango Herald reported."
health,"“If you notice decreased rodent activity in an area where you normally see active rodents, contact your local public health agency,” the CDPHE said while also asking locals not to kill prairie dogs on their property as this could increase the risk of plague transmission if it is present."
health,"Plague can be transmitted to humans from direct contact with infected animals or if a person is bitten by an infected flea. Symptoms include the sudden onset of fever and/or swollen lymph nodes. It can be treated with antibiotics if caught early, though complications or death can result if it’s left untreated, according to CDPHE."
health,"In recent decades there have been an average of seven cases in humans each year in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with the majority of cases in northern New Mexico, which borders Colorado."
health,"The disease can take different clinical forms but, according to the CDC, the majority of cases in the U.S. have been the bubonic form, which can cause swollen and painful lymph nodes closest to where the bacteria entered the body."
health,"TOKYO (AP) — About 100 of the 613 U.S. athletes descending on Tokyo for the Olympics are unvaccinated, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee’s medical chief said hours before Friday night’s opening ceremony."
health,"The five other Colorado counties identified as having plague-positive samples were San Miguel County, El Paso County, Boulder County, Huerfano County and Adams County. "
health,"“Eighty-three percent is actually a substantial number and we’re quite happy with it,” Finnoff said."
health,"Historically, plague is known for having killed an estimated 50 million people in Asia, Europe and Africa in the 14th century, when it was known as the “Black Death,” according to the World Health Organization."
health,"Medical director Jonathan Finnoff said 567 of the American athletes had filled out their health histories as they prepared for the trip, and estimated 83% had replied they were vaccinated."
health,"Nationally, 56.3% of Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
health,The IOC has estimated around 85% of residents of the Olympic Village are vaccinated; that’s based that on what each country’s Olympic committee reports but is not an independently verified number.
health,The USOPC leadership has almost completely turned over since then.
health,The USOPC figure is more solid — based on questionnaires athletes were asked to fill out before they came to Japan. Finnoff said the committee is not differentiating its treatment of athletes based on whether they’re vaccinated.
health,"So far, two American athletes — beach volleyball player Taylor Crabb and Kara Eaker, an alternate on the gymnastics team — are known to have tested positive. The IOC has reported 13 positives among all athletes in Japan."
health,"“The best thing to do is to assume everyone’s at risk, and reduce risk by introducing COVID mitigation measures that we know work,” he said."
health,"Susanne Lyons is the new chair, Sarah Hirshland is the new CEO and Rick Adams is the new chief of sport performance."
health,"The vaccination rate was the biggest news to come out of an hourlong Q&A with USOPC leadership — a far different affair from the last pre-Olympic news conference. That one, at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, was dominated by talk of the federation’s handling of sex-abuse cases in the wake of the trial of former team doctor Larry Nassar."
health,"Part of the USOPC’s reboot involved deemphasizing the quest for medals and focusing more on athlete health and welfare. The U.S. has led the medals table at every Summer Games since 1996, the Olympics after the old Soviet team disbanded."
health,"But Hirshland is well aware that her performance, and the team’s, will still be judged at some level on medals. “Is the U.S. coming here hoping to win a lot of medals? You bet we are,” Hirshland said."
health,"All expectations, however, are tempered by the reality that a COVID outbreak could turn plans upside down."
health,"“Athletes have adjusted to being comfortable being uncomfortable,” Adams said. “They’ve been experiencing it, and over the next 17 days, the expectation is to set expectations around things that could change.”"

So for her to be doing what she’s doing, it’s insane to me. This is like total GOAT (Greatest Of All Time) status to me. To win three times in a season, be world No. 1, going for gold."
women,"Korda tapped in for par and a 2-under 69 for a one-shot victory. Moments later, her 28-year-old sister, Jessica, joined her on the green for a hug and a shimmy. Jessica had finished earlier with a 64 to tie for 15th and looked forward to little sister’s big moment."
women,"Mone Inami of Japan delivered the golf-loving host nation a silver medal, and it was nearly better than that."
women,"She had gone over the 18th green in the third round and made bogey, and was tentative with her swing on Saturday. It came up short and plugged in the sand on the slope near the face. The best she could manage was to blast out to 30 feet. She made bogey for a 65."
women,Lydia Ko of New Zealand needed a 35-foot birdie putt to tie for the lead on the 18th. She left it 4 feet short and had to make that for a 65 to finish one behind.
women,"“I regretted why I did not make a full swing,” she said."
women,"In the playoff for the silver, Ko found a bunker off the tee on the 18th hole, had to lay up and missed a 10-foot par putt."
women,"Ko had to settle for the bronze, after winning the silver in 2016 at Rio de Janeiro. She is the only golfer to win medals in both Olympics since the sport returned after a 112-year absence."
women,"“It’s not easy playing as the No. 1 in the Olympics. I did that in Rio,” Ko said. “And for her to fight through those kind of pressure and expectations and to end up winning the gold, I think it shows what kind of class player she is."
women,“I’m sure this is the start of many more majors and many more wins for Nelly.”
women,"There was nothing easy about this final round for Korda, even starting with a three-shot lead. She fell into a tie for the lead, rebuilt it to three shots early on the back nine and then closed with six pars as three players made a bold run at her."
women,"That list include Aditi Ashok of India, at an extreme disadvantage all week with her lack of distance off the tee, some of that brought on by a bout with COVID-19 this summer. With her magic touch on the greens — she one-putted the entire front nine — the 23-year-old with her mother as her caddie stayed in the mix all day."
women,"“I didn’t leave anything out there. I think I gave it my 100%,” Ashok said. “But yeah, fourth in the Olympics where they give out three medals kind of sucks.”"
women,"Ashok’s 12-foot birdie putt to keep pace with Ko burned the edge of the cup on the 17th hole, and she needed a 25-foot birdie putt on the 18th to stay in medal contention. That slid by the hole."
women,Korda finished at 17-under 267 and made two double bogeys this week.
women,"One came on the 18th hole of the second round when she needed a birdie for a 59. Korda and her caddie did not realize the tee box was 30 yards forward, leading to the wrong club and wrong line into the rough behind a tree."
women,"The other was Saturday on the par-3 seventh when her tee shot went left into a collection area. It took Korda three chips to get onto the green, and the double bogey dropped her into a tie with Ko and Ashok."
women,All three birdied the par-5 eighth — Korda with a 25-foot putt that was as big as any — and Korda ran off birdies at the next two holes to restore her three-shot lead.
women,"“I told myself there’s still a lot of golf to be left and I’m very proud of how I handled the next three holes, or even just the entire round after that,” Korda said."
women,"Inami, Ko and Ashok all whittled away until they ran out of holes and Korda was left with a shiny gold medal and a future brighter than ever."
women,"Audiences got a first look at the highly anticipated, female-led reboot of “Doogie Howser, M.D.” with the release of the show’s opening title sequence. "
women,"Due out Sept. 8 on Disney+, “Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.” follows 16-year-old physician Lahela “Doogie” Kamealoha (played by Peyton Elizabeth Lee), who juggles a budding career in medicine with the typical challenges of being a teenager. "
women,"On Tuesday, Disney+ unveiled the opening sequence, for which composer Wendy Wang and ukulele player Jake Shimabukuro have produced a reimagined take on the “Doogie Howser” theme song that befits the new show’s Hawaiian setting. "
women,"The original “Doogie Howser” debuted in 1989 starring Neil Patrick Harris as the titular teen prodigy. The ABC series ran for four seasons and left a lasting imprint on pop culture, tackling of-the-moment subjects such as racism, body positivity and HIV/AIDS. "
women,"Watch the opening sequence of “Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.” below. "
women,"Lee, who previously starred in the Disney Channel series “Andi Mack,” told Entertainment Weekly in an interview published Tuesday that “Doogie Kamealoha, M.D.” features “nods to the original but also feels very modern.”"
women,"“She has so many responsibilities,” the actor said of her character, “and her parents are always there to remind her that she is a 16-year-old girl and 16-year-old girls make mistakes and have crushes on boys and have troubles with their friends.”"
women,"“One of the really cool parts about this reimagining is that we take this iconic story and bring it into the world we’re living in now,” she explained. “So it’s a female lead instead of a male, and she is biracial, and it’s in Hawaii so we have this beautiful backdrop.”"
women,"In an appearance on the “Just for Variety” podcast in February, Harris said he was “so happy” about Disney’s plans to reboot the show."
women,"“I think setting it with a female protagonist is a great call,” he said. “I feel like it’s a passion project for many, and I can’t wait to watch it.”"
women,Jennifer Valente gave the hard-luck American cycling team a reason to hold their heads high Sunday when she got up from a crash in the omnium-ending points race to secure U.S. cycling’s only gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics.
women,And that wasn’t the biggest crash of the day.
women,"Italian rider Elisa Balsamo hit Emily Kay of Ireland as they began the final lap of the scratch race, the first event of the omnium, triggering a massive front-stretch pile-up that brought down seven riders. "
women,"In the final race of the entire Olympic cycling program, Valente won the first sprint in the points race to pad her lead, then got up from a crash with 30 laps left to keep from losing any ground on her closest pursuers. She wound up taking second in the final sprint to secure the gold medal — then broke down in tears when she got off her bike."
women,"With the riders and their bikes tangled in a heap on the track apron, Valente seized the opportunity and outsprinted Yumi Kajihara and Annette Edmondson to win the race for maximum points."
women,Kajihara took silver for Japan. Kirsten Wild earned bronze for the Netherlands.
women,"Just because a bipartisan group of senators agreed to a massive bill aiming to overhaul the nation’s infrastructure system doesn’t mean the Senate should hold off on killing the filibuster, opponents of the long-standing rule argued this week. "
women,"At $1.2 trillion, the newly minted Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act is the largest infrastructure bill in a century. It includes billions in new spending on roads, bridges, airports and waterways, as well as additional funding to expand transit, broadband and electric vehicles across the country. If it gets to his desk, the bill will prove a big accomplishment for President Joe Biden, who once predicted that Republicans would have an “epiphany” and work with him after he took office in January. "
women,"“We’re able to do a few things bipartisan, but we can’t do voting rights, we can’t do worker rights. We can’t do the kinds of systemic things like democracy reforms and worker issues,” Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) told HuffPost. "
women,"But to vocal filibuster critics like Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), one moment of cooperation doesn’t signal a broader shift among GOP senators on more controversial issues such as gun control, voting, climate or immigration. When asked if the bipartisan infrastructure agreement undercuts the case for eliminating the 60-vote threshold for legislation, Durbin said, “In a way it does, in a way it doesn’t.”"
women,"If there was a bipartisan deal to be had, it makes sense that it’d be on infrastructure. It’s one of the few issues that enjoys bipartisan support nationwide, and it’s politically popular. Even former President Donald Trump proposed an infrastructure plan."
women,"“You’re giving stuff away. You’re building things and in every direction, members get to cut ribbons and wear hard hats. You know, it’s the easiest bill in the world, in that respect,” the Illinois Democrat said of passing infrastructure legislation."
women,"“I will also tell you I live in a world of the 20th anniversary of the Dream Act, and I’ve lost that on the [Senate] floor five times to the filibuster,” he continued. “So I don’t believe that I could bring together a group and negotiate anything close to what we need on immigration at this point.”"
women,"Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), a key member of the bipartisan group of 20 senators that drafted the infrastructure bill, called the filibuster “important” but suggested he could be open to reforms down the road on issues fundamental to democracy, such as voting rights."
women,"Congress has been stagnant when it comes to immigration reform, even on popular issues such as protecting some immigrants, known as Dreamers, from deportation. Biden last week announced his support for advancing some immigration changes, including a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, unilaterally via the budget reconciliation process. But it’s unclear how such changes would survive the strict rules governing the process. "
women,"“I don’t know that it makes any difference. I don’t know that you can glean much from one situation,” Tester said when asked if the deal he helped negotiate blunted the case for changes to the filibuster."
women,"The push to reform the filibuster has no chance of succeeding at the moment. Biden, who often defended the filibuster when he was a senator, remains cool to broad changes even though he’s warmed to the idea in recent years. Democrats also lack the math to go nuclear and gut the rule, as there are a handful of moderates in the Senate who still support it. The loudest among them is Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who seems happy to hog the limelight on that front even if he isn’t alone in his party on defending the rule."
women,"Manchin has repeatedly ruled out killing the filibuster in any circumstance. During an interview over the weekend, the Democratic senator said he couldn’t even imagine supporting a carve-out to the filibuster rules that would allow the Senate to pass voting rights legislation with fewer than 60 votes out of fear of a slippery-slope scenario. Instead, Manchin said he’s hoping to pass a “compromise” voting proposal that so far has only attracted the support of one Republican senator."
women,"For Republicans, the bipartisan deal on infrastructure is more evidence of why the filibuster should remain on the books (it’s also partly why many of them voted to advance the bill, to show the country that the Senate is able to govern). In addition to fostering compromise, they argued, the filibuster forces lawmakers to produce better legislation ― at least better, in their view, than the $3.5 trillion “human” infrastructure bill Democrats are hoping to pass later this year."
women,"“What you see is when we work together and really put the nose to the grindstone, we can get bipartisan support to move forward,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) said. “That’s what the bipartisan group did, so I think it blunts the argument on the filibuster. I think this going to be better policy than what they roll out next week.”"
women,"NEW YORK (AP) — Investigators conducting an inquiry into sexual harassment allegations against New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo questioned him for eleven hours when he met with them last month, The New York Times reported Monday."
women,"The Times spoke to five peoplewho had been briefed on the meeting, and who recounted some details on the condition of anonymity."
women,"The Times reported that at points, the videotaped interview was tense, with Cuomo challenging one of the investigators on his fairness and independence. When the investigators were done, they left through an exit away from the building entrance where photographers were, the paper said."
women,"Asked about his meeting with investigators at a press conference on Monday, Cuomo declined to say anything."
women,"“I said I would cooperate with it and at the appropriate time I will comment on the review,” he said. “But this is not the appropriate time yet.”"
women,Cuomo has denied the allegations.
women,State Attorney General Letitia James hired the investigators to conduct the probe after several women accused Cuomo of subjecting them to inappropriate kisses and touching or inappropriate sexual remarks.
women,Molly Seidel was overcome by seeing her family celebrate after she won a surprising bronze medal in the women’s marathon Saturday at the Tokyo Olympics.
women,"It was just her third marathon ever, and she clocked 2:27:46 on a hot day to become the third American woman ever to medal in the Olympic event. Kenya’s Peres Jepchirchir and Brigid Kosgei won gold and silver, respectively."
women,"Watch the emotion and exhaustion wash over Seidel, 27, as she sees the people she loves share in the moment."
women,"Oh yeah, and she had a special request. Many of us can relate after even running a 5K."
women,"We don’t even know her, but we’re gonna have a beer anyway in her honor."
women,"Cheers, Molly."
women,Megan Rapinoe and Sue Bird just sealed the probable end of their Olympics careers with a kiss.
women,"Bird won her fifth straight gold medal on Sunday with the U.S. women’s basketball team, which defeated Japan, 90-75, to extend its overall Olympic gold streak to seven. She got a sweet congratulations from fiancee Rapinoe. "
women,Rapinoe also celebrated Bird’s victory on Instagram.
women,“I am so proud of you @sbird10 ❤️. As if I could love you any more 🥰. Congrats baby!” Rapinoe wrote.
women,One of sports’ great power couples has plenty to look back on.
women,"Rapinoe, the 36-year-old U.S. soccer star, has collected a bronze and a gold in her Summer Games career, in addition to two World Cup titles. The four-time WNBA champion Bird, 40, along with U.S. teammate Diana Taurasi, has more Olympic gold medals than any American basketball player. She said this will be her last Olympics."

women,"The Duchess of York, who is on a whirlwind media tour to promote her debut adult historical novel, said that she and the disgraced prince are the “happiest divorced couple in the world.” "
women,"Andrew himself has been accused of raping Virginia Giuffre, who was a minor at the time, in encounters arranged by Epstein. In an interview with BBC “Newsnight” in November 2019, the prince attempted to defend himself against the allegations. The interview was so poorly received that Andrew was essentially forced to publicly step back from royal duties in November 2019. "
women,Sarah “Fergie” Ferguson discussed her relationship with her ex-husband (and current roommate) Prince Andrew and surviving her own royal divorce in an interview with the Financial Times published on Friday. 
women,"
“Andrew and I call it divorced to each other, not from each other . Compromise. Communicate. Say what you feel ....What’s the point in having an argument, honestly? ” Fergie said.Andrew and the duchess were married from 1986 to 1996, though they separated in 1992. They have two children together, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, and continue to live together at the Royal Lodge in Windsor."
women,"
The “Her Heart For a Compass” author added that she “one hundred per cent” believes Andrew didn’t witness inappropriate behavior during his long friendship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffery Epstein."
women,"Despite her praise of her ex-husband, Ferguson wouldn’t answer reporter Henry Mance’s questions about whether the prince would return to royal duties and what she thought of the “Newsnight” interview."
women,"In a bizarre and disprovable addendum, she said, “I’m the only divorced woman who is still alive.”"
women,"“It’s been very challenging for him. None of my life is duty. It’s because I feel it. I want him to come through this. I want him to win,” she said, later adding, “I know everything about him. I think he is an extraordinary person.”"
women,"Fergie has continued to make headline-grabbing statements throughout her media tour, recently defending son-in-law Jack Brooksbank after photos emerged of him on a yacht with a topless woman, which were accompanied by what the duchess called a “completely fabricated” story."
women,"“He was so good to me when I went through absolute, abject hell,” Ferguson said of the 2010 scandal in which she was recorded by a tabloid reporter offering access to her ex-husband in exchange for half a million pounds. “He unquestionably stood by me. It’s not a tit-for-tat. It’s just, I know who he is.” "
women,"“I’m lucky I wasn’t locked up. I would have been! I would have been hysterical, and mad, and a witch and burnt, and all those other things ,” she said. “You don’t divorce [from a royal] and keep your head. Anne Boleyn didn’t!”"
women,"The duchess went on, discussing her own 1996 divorce from Andrew."
women,Head over to the Financial Times to read more of Ferguson’s latest interview. 
women,"I had timed everything perfectly. My 4-year-old was on the couch watching “Paw Patrol” while I bopped around the kitchen, lulling my infant to sleep in the baby carrier. I had 15 minutes before I had to lead a webinar, and I needed him to sleep. I couldn’t risk him crying and having to explain the noise. My job knew I was a mom; they just had no idea I had given birth to an entirely new human six months ago ― and I was too deep in the lie to risk getting caught now. "
women,"I worked for a city agency remotely as a contractor. It started as a temporary seasonal gig one summer but when fall rolled around, they kept me on. They kept extending my “temp” position until it began to feel permanent, minus any real benefits or paid time off. In the four years I worked for them, I worked hard to prove myself invaluable. Yet, they never offered me a permanent position, and I was too scared to ask for one. I felt like I had hit the mom-job lottery, working remotely with a flexible schedule, and I was afraid to push my luck. "
women,"After I got off the phone with my supervisor, the excitement about my raise started to wear off as the reality of what I had just committed to started to sink in. I decided I wasn’t going to tell them I was about to have another baby. I was scared they wouldn’t trust that I could handle a newborn and my workload at the same time. I worried that if I told them I could be in labor during the first few days of the project, they’d offer it to someone else."
women,"Then I got pregnant with our second child. After the overwhelming exhaustion that is the first trimester wore off and the pregnancy had entered the “announcement” phase, I wasn’t debating whether to tell my job ― I just didn’t know how. Was this the kind of news I shared over email? What was the remote-work pregnancy disclosure etiquette? I started to wonder if I would even bring it up at all. "
women,"Before I had the chance to figure out how to work my pregnancy into the conversation, I was offered the chance to lead a project that would begin, you guessed it, the week of my due date. This was a huge opportunity and turning it down would mean walking away from a raise. So, without even really thinking about the logistics of how I’d pull it off, I accepted the project. "
women,"I knew they couldn’t fire me because I was pregnant, but that didn’t mean they couldn’t passively lighten my load. I had seen it before ― other women being passed over for opportunities because they were about to go on maternity leave, or had just come back from one. Plus, as an hourly worker with no benefits, that meant no paid time off, and we needed the money, so I committed to keeping the pregnancy a secret. "
women,"When my husband got home from work that night, I told him about my plan. He thought I was insane, but he was used to me biting off more than I could chew work-wise, so he knew better than to try to convince me otherwise. “I just don’t know how you’re not going to accidentally slip,” he said. "
women,"At one point it dawned on me that even though I was very careful not to accidentally mention the pregnancy during a work call or in an email, I was blasting it all over the internet through my social media accounts. I frantically Googled myself to see if any evidence of my pregnancy could be found online. I deleted my last name from my Instagram bio, scrolled through my followers to make sure no one even remotely connected to my employer was following me, and hoped for the best."
women,"At 38 weeks, my body decided it was done being pregnant and I developed gestational hypertension. On the way to be induced, I sent emails to my team saying I had a “family emergency” and would be out for the day. After a 15-hour induction, I gave birth to a sweet 6-pound baby boy, and the hole I had dug for myself got a heck of a lot deeper. "
women,"It turns out it’s easy to hide a pregnancy when you work remotely. As my stomach grew, I strategically positioned the camera to hide it from view. As my due date neared, it got harder to hide. I’m sure my team probably thought to themselves, man, she got fat ... while staring at my swollen face over Zoom as I struggled to catch my breath every few seconds. I thought about telling them so many times, but I had made it nearly nine months, and the project I was leading was about to launch. I was committed to the lie and past the point of no return. It was similar to when you forget someone’s name, but you’ve known them way too long to admit it, so you just keep hoping it never comes up."
women,"When my husband returned to work after his way-too-brief parental leave, I navigated breastfeeding a newborn between meetings and caring for my older son. My supervisor and I had become close over the years, even though we’d never met in person, and we often shared stories about our children over email. It felt so weird for me to be talking about my older son without mentioning that I had a whole other person in my family now. But even though the project I was working on was well underway and I no longer had to worry about getting passed over for opportunities, I figured they would think I was crazy for having kept this a secret in the first place."
women,"Three months into my ruse, COVID hit, and things got even more complicated. My older son’s school shut down, first for “just two weeks...” and then, similar to my temporary contract employment, things just kept getting extended without any talk of whether it was permanent. Emails between my supervisor and I got even more personal as we shared the struggles of juggling impromptu home schooling and work. She told me deeply intimate things about her life and her struggles as a wife, mom and fellow human during the pandemic. As I held my newborn baby while writing back without any mention of his presence, I felt like a terrible person for not being equally as vulnerable and open with her. "

She lives in New York with her husband, their two children and a tabby cat named Eloise. In between raising humans and watering her plants, she writes parenting and early education resources for Winnie.com. You can find her on Twitter at @ahhitschristine."
women,"According to the U.S. Department of Labor, nearly 85% of women will become mothers at some point during their careers. The Pregnancy Discrimination Act passed in 1978 technically protects a pregnant person’s workplace rights. Yet, tens of thousands of discrimination claims are filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Fair Employment Practices Agency each year. I’d like to think my story is an outlier, but unfortunately, the data says otherwise. "
women,First-time Olympian Sarah Hildebrandt was moments from advancing to the gold-medal match in women’s 50-kilogram freestyle wrestling on Friday.
women,"Once my project wrapped, I was laid off and thereby spared from ever having to admit I had been hiding a baby. Now that I’ve had some distance from it all, I realize just how sad it is that I felt like I had to carry the lie of omission in the first place. Despite laws to protect a pregnant person from being fired or discriminated against, the problem persists and is pervasive. "
women,"It became a joke among my friends ― my hidden baby. Some of them genuinely didn’t understand why I kept him a secret, asking me “...you just didn’t feel like telling them or…?” Others were impressed that I managed to keep such an enormous secret throughout an entire pregnancy and for six months of being a mom to a child I never mentioned. My more level-headed friends encouraged me to come clean, but after all the soul-baring emails my supervisor and I had exchanged about our lockdown lives, I just didn’t have the heart to admit what I’d done."
women,"I would think about telling her often, in between my stories about bread making or my older son’s Zoom lunch dates with his preschool teacher. I thought maybe I’d just casually mention the baby, as if she’d always known about him. Maybe she’d worry that in all the craziness of the last few months she forgot I had a baby, we’d both just never mention it again and I could rid myself of the guilt that was gnawing at me. I held myself back from telling her, though, mostly because I realized how ridiculous it was that I even felt like I had to keep it a secret to begin with. "
women,"A year later, I was hired full time by a family-friendly company. Now I no longer need to time naps around work calls or hide the number of people in my family. I have unlimited paid time off and health benefits. The organization embraces parenthood and prides itself on hiring moms with gaps in their resumes due to raising kids, a demographic that often finds themselves snubbed by hiring managers. As I toss Cheerios onto my now toddler’s tray during team sync, I’m glad to be past the point of having to live a lie. And no, my former employer still doesn’t know I hid my pregnancy, birth and six months of my son’s life from them ― although I guess the secret’s out now. "
women,"Leading China’s Sun Yanan by 2 points with about 12 seconds left, USA’s Hildebrandt stepped out of bounds, giving a point to her opponent. The clock continued to tick away, with Hildebrandt clinging to a 7-6 lead."
women,"But time was not on the Granger, Indiana, native’s side."
women,Sun won with a 4-point throw as time was running out.
women,Oof. That’s a tough break.
women,"Hildebrandt led 7-0 early in the match, the South Bend Tribune reported."
women,"The annualized real growth in America’s Gross Domestic Product during Trump’s administration was the worst since the Great Depression, according to updated and revised government data. And quarterly GDP data, which only dates back to Dwight Eisenhower’s presidency beginning in 1953, puts Trump dead last among the dozen presidents since then, according to Bloomberg."
women,A key economic indicator that Donald Trump loved to boast about wasn’t so great during his time in office. Far from it.
women,She still has a chance for bronze.
women,The Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis has four quarters of data for each year only going back to Eisenhower’s term. 
women,"The economy clearly took a hit from the coronavirus pandemic during Trump’s final year in office. But previous presidents also faced formidable troubles and the GDP fared better. GDP grew 1.8% during George W. Bush’s presidency, roiled by 9/11 and the financial industry’s subprime mortgage debacle. It increased 2.1% during Barack Obama’s term, which featured the Great Recession. Trump notched a last-place 1.6% increase."
women,"But annual figures go all the way back to 1929. From that year to 1933, including the Great Depression when Herbert Hoover was president, annualized growth was negative 7.4%. The second-worst record since then was Trump’s, Bloomberg reported."
women,"Bloomberg jiggles the numbers a bit to adjust the comparison periods, but Trump doesn’t come off great in any of them. Check them out here."
women,"President Joe Biden cheered the report. “That’s progress,” he tweeted."
women,"While GDP growth is an important indicator of the economy, it’s not typically one that presidents obsess over. Trump was different. He claimed the figure would jump as much as 6% on his watch."
women,"The U.S. economy grew at an annualized rate of 6.5% in the second quarter this year, according to the latest Bureau of Economic Analysis report. That was the second-largest jump since 2003, when George W. Bush was president."
women,"A big jump in GDP growth does not necessarily indicate a healthy economy. An economy can be so wrecked, as it was during the Depression, for example, that a huge jump in the GDP may bring the economy to only middling. It also doesn’t track income inequality or the sustainability of growth, Business Insider pointed out."
women,Britney Spears is pushing to move up the hearing date on the conservatorship that has dictated nearly every aspect of her life for the last 13 years.
women,"Mathew Rosengart, the attorney Spears picked to represent her, filed a motion in Los Angeles probate court on Thursday asking Judge Brenda Penny to advance the next court hearing to Aug. 23 or, at the very least, before Sept. 5. "
women,"The hearing on whether Spears’ father, James “Jamie” Spears, should remain her conservator is currently scheduled for Sept. 29."
women,"Spears, 39, has been trying since last fall to remove her father from the conservatorship in a highly publicized battle. She testified in open court on June 23, denouncing her father’s control over her finances and freedom and the conservatorship’s dehumanizing restraints on her ability to make her own choices."
women,"“Every day that passes is another day of avoidable harm and prejudice to Ms. Spears and the Estate,” the filing read, adding that the pop star’s “emotional health and well-being must be, and are, the paramount concern.”"
women,"“In short, although a two-month wait for a hearing on the Petition may not seem significant in the context of 13 years, Ms. Spears should not be forced to continue [to] feel traumatized, lose sleep, and suffer further,” Rosengart wrote. “Every day matters.”"
women,"Rosengart is the first legal counsel that Britney Spears has had permission to select on her own in her conservatorship case. He filed petitions on July 26 asking the court to remove and replace Spears’ father as one of her conservators because he was “stripping his daughter of her dignity, autonomy, and certain fundamental liberties” while she earned the large sums of money."
women,"In the filing on Thursday, Rosengart said he believes Jamie Spears has “dissipated” his daughter’s hard-earned money, accusing him of overpaying the singer’s former business manager, Tri Star Sports and Entertainment. Jamie Spears paid the firm $500,000 in December 2019, according to the filing ― about $300,000 more than what was allegedly due, despite his daughter’s performance hiatus earlier that year."
women,"The lawyer petitioned the court to replace Jamie Spears with Jason Rubin, a professional fiduciary and forensic accountant with experience as a conservator. On Thursday, the attorney reiterated that request and asked that it happen whether Jamie Spears is removed or suspended as his daughter’s conservator."
women,"Rosengart also cited the fact that Britney Spears’ mother, Lynne Spears, had called Jamie Spears “incapable of putting my daughter’s interests ahead of his own on both a professional and a personal level and that his being and remaining a conservator of my daughter’s estate is not in the best interests of my daughter, the conservatee.” "
women,Jamie Spears’ attorneys have denied any wrongdoing.
women,"Britney Spears’ medical team also recommended that the pop star’s father be removed from the conservatorship for her mental health, according to a petition on behalf of co-conservator Jodi Montgomery, who has overseen the personal and medical aspects of the singer’s conservatorship since 2019."
women,"Penny, the judge overseeing the case, was originally going to consider Rosengart’s petitions at a Dec. 13 hearing. That date was advanced to Sept. 29."
women,"“Mr. Spears’ immediate suspension and removal should be inexorable,” Rosengart’s filing said. “Indeed, as we have previously stated, if Mr. Spears truly had the best interests of his daughter in mind, consistent with his obligation as a fiduciary to elevate her interests above his own, he would resign, today.”"
women,"Allyson Felix further cemented her Olympic greatness at the Tokyo games, finishing third in the 400-meter race on Friday."
women,Shaunae Miller-Uibo of Bahamas won in 48.36 seconds and Marileidy Paulino of the Dominican Republic was second in 49.20. Felix’s time was 49.46 ― just a few ticks behind her personal best of 49.26. 
women,"Felix’s bronze medal ― the 10th Olympic medal she has won in her storied career ― felt more like a coronation. She vaulted past Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey to become the most decorated female track athlete in Summer Games history, and is now tied with U.S. legend Carl Lewis."
women,"Felix, 35, began her Olympic career at age 18 and has steadily accumulated hardware. She won one medal in 2004, two in 2008, three in 2012 and three in 2016."
women,"She has a chance to pass Lewis’ count in the 4x400 relay on Saturday. Paavo Nurmi of Finland holds the all-time track medals record with 12, according to NBC."
women,This was Felix’s first Olympics since becoming a mom. She gave birth to daughter Camryn via an emergency C-section in 2018 after a pregnancy that put both of them at risk. She later accused Nike of attempting to severely cut her pay in contract negotiations after she became a mother.
women,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) sexually harassed multiple female employees and created a “hostile work environment for women,” an investigation by the New York state attorney general concluded on Tuesday morning."
women,"“The independent investigation has concluded that Governor Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed multiple women and in doing so violated federal and state law,” New York state Attorney General Letitia James announced in a press conference."
women,"The investigation found that Cuomo “sexually harassed current and former New York State employees by engaging in unwelcome and non-consensual touching and making numerous offensive comments of a suggestive and sexual nature that created a hostile work environment for women,” James said Tuesday."
women,"Cuomo denied the allegations later on Tuesday, telling reporters he “never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances.”"
women,"The attorney general’s office spoke with 179 people for the investigation and reviewed more than 74,000 pieces of evidence, including emails, texts, photos and audio files. The evidence painted a “deeply disturbing yet clear picture” that Cuomo sexually harassed female employees, many of whom were young women, James said."
women,"The report said that Cuomo sexually harassed 11 women, including a state trooper assigned to his protective detail, members of the public and current and former staff members. Nine women accused Cuomo of sexual harassment and inappropriate comments earlier this year."
women,"The report noted two new accusers, one of whom was the state trooper. The trooper said Cuomo engaged in sexual misconduct on numerous occasions, including the following allegations: one time when Cuomo ran his finger down her back and said “hey you;” kissed only her on the cheek during a meeting with multiple people present, and later asked to kiss her again, which she deflected; asked her why she didn’t wear a dress; and asked her to help him find a girlfriend, telling the trooper he’s looking for someone who “can handle pain.” Several other state troopers on Cuomo’s protective detail corroborated the female trooper’s allegations."
women,The investigation found that Cuomo and his senior team actively retaliated against one woman who accused Cuomo of sexual harassment.
women,"“Governor Cuomo’s administration fostered a toxic workplace that enabled harassment and created a hostile work environment where staffers did not feel comfortable coming forward with complaints about sexual harassment due to a climate of fear and given the power dynamics,” James said."
women,"Although Cuomo’s behavior violated state and federal law, James noted that the report did not reach a conclusion to whether Cuomo’s conduct amounts to criminal prosecution."
women,"The inquiry into Cuomo’s conduct began in March, after Cuomo himself authorized the investigation ― a move many perceived as a last-ditch effort to stave off calls for his resignation. Independent investigators and attorneys Joon Kim and Anne Clark led the investigation. Kim and Clarke questioned Cuomo for 11 hours earlier this week as part of the investigation process, The New York Times reported."
women,"Cuomo issued a half-hearted apology in March when the accusations first came out, but has since changed his tune. “I’m very eager to get the facts to the people of this state,” Cuomo said last week. “I think when they hear the actual facts, what happened, how the situation has been handled, I think they’re going to be shocked. Shocked.”"
women,"During his Tuesday remarks, Cuomo suggested accusers were motivated by politics or publicity. He framed himself as a champion of women, complete with a lengthy aside on sexism faced by women managers. And he showed a slideshow of photos of himself and other politicians hugging people or kissing them on the cheek, insisting it showed his behavior has been nothing out of the ordinary."
women,"In March, President Joe Biden said that Cuomo should resign if the sexual harassment allegations against the governor were confirmed.Biden said during a Tuesday afternoon press conference that he stands by his original statement: “I think that he should resign.” "
women,"Several New York state lawmakers have already called for Cuomo’s resignation in light of the investigation’s findings. New York state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D) said that “the Governor must resign for the good of the state.” Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) urged Cuomo to resign and called for his arrest, adding that Biden must immediately call for the governor’s resignation."
women,"UltraViolet, a national women’s organization, called for the governor’s resignation in March when women initially accused Cuomo of sexual harassment. "
women,"“No one is above the law and today justice must be served,” Stefanik said in a Tuesday afternoon statement. “The media and Democrats smeared me and closed ranks to protect Cuomo, a shameful chapter in New York history. All of them including his staff must be held to account. These brave women deserve swift and definitive justice.”"
women,"“Today we are reiterating our call for Cuomo to resign and urge the Democrats who encouraged this investigation by Attorney General James’ office to demand accountability from Cuomo immediately. If Cuomo refuses to resign from office, we demand his timely removal by New York legislators,” said Bridget Todd, director of communications at UltraViolet."
women,"“This report proves what we suspected — Andrew Cuomo is unfit to represent New York state,” Todd continued. “We implore Democrats who called for this investigation to take the results seriously. Anything less is unacceptable and a flagrant disregard for past, present and future employees and residents of New York State.”"
women,"ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A majority of state Assembly members support beginning impeachment proceedings against Gov. Andrew Cuomo if he doesn’t resign over investigative findings that he sexually harassed at least 11 women, according to an Associated Press count Wednesday."
women,"Cuomo has denied that he made any inappropriate sexual advances and insisted the findings didn’t reflect the facts. But while political pressure grew, so did the potential for criminal charges against Cuomo, who basked in national attention last year as the blunt-but-relatable voice of fighting the coronavirus in an early U.S. hotspot, only to see his political future imperiled a year later."
women,At least 82 of the body’s 150 members have said publicly or told The AP that they favored initiating the process of ousting the third-term Democratic governor if he doesn’t quit. A simple majority of Assembly members is needed to authorize an impeachment trial.
women,"District attorneys in Manhattan, suburban Westchester and Nassau counties and the state capital of Albany said they asked for investigative materials from the inquiry, overseen by Democratic state Attorney General Letitia James."
women,"James’ investigation found that Cuomo had violated civil laws against sexual harassment. Making no conclusions about whether he should be criminally charged, investigators left the door open for local prosecutors to bring cases."
women,"After James released her report Tuesday, Democrats from the statehouse to the White House called for Cuomo to go, with President Joe Biden saying the governor should resign. But he showed no signs of heeding them, saying that some episodes described in the report never happened, others were misconstrued or mischaracterized and the whole exercise was tainted."
women,"“We are reviewing the deeply disturbing findings,” said Joyce A. Smith, the acting district attorney in Long Island’s Nassau County. She pledged her office would “thoroughly and expeditiously investigate any potential crimes” that happened there."
women,"“Politics and bias are interwoven throughout every aspect of this situation,” he said in a recorded video response."
women,"Assembly Democrats, who lead the chamber, debated virtually for hours Tuesday about whether to impeach the governor now, wait to see whether he resigns, or give the Assembly Judiciary Committee time to wrap up its wide-ranging investigation into topics from sexual misconduct to the Cuomo administration’s monthslong obfuscation of the total number of nursing home residents who died from COVID-19."
women,"As New York went through a harrowing coronavirus surge in spring 2020, Cuomo’s daily briefings garnered him fans around the country and an International Emmy Award. Casting himself as a tough-minded yet compassionate leader who steered the state through its biggest public health emergency in a century, the governor even wrote a book about it."
women,At least 40 of the Assembly members who say they are ready to start impeachment proceedings are Democrats.
women,"Now, that book itself is among the focuses of investigations into Cuomo, with James examining the role some of his aides played in producing it."
women,"As complaints and investigations accumulated in recent months, Cuomo became an embattled but unabashed figure. He often still touts the state’s handling of the pandemic despite now-rising infection rates amid a national surge in the more infectious delta variant."
women,"If the Assembly votes to impeach Cuomo, the state Senate could launch an impeachment trial “in weeks,” Deputy Majority Leader Mike Gianaris told The Associated Press."
women,"Gianaris, a Democrat, said the chamber has been preparing for a potential impeachment trial for months."
women,"“We’ll be ready to go if and when the impeachment articles are sent over,” he said. “It could happen very quickly.”"
women,"The 150-member Assembly would need 76 votes to impeach Cuomo and send articles of impeachment to the Senate. The Assembly includes 106 Democrats, 43 Republicans and one Independent."
women,"At least two dozen Assembly Democrats called for impeachment in public statements issued Tuesday, according to a tally compiled by The Associated Press. Some said the Assembly should vote for impeachment now, while others said the chamber should impeach Cuomo if he doesn’t resign."
women,"Assembly Republican Leader Will Barclay urged Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat, to convene an emergency special session to vote to impeach Cuomo."
women,"James’ investigation, conducted by two outside lawyers, painted what she called a “clear picture” of a governor who touched or made sexually inappropriate comments to a series of women, many of whom worked for him. One is a state trooper whom Cuomo successfully sought to have assigned to his security detail."
women,"The governor denied Tuesday that he ever inappropriately touched anyone, said that he never intended harm and cast doubt on the political motivations of investigators, accusers and critics."
women,"While many of the allegations against Cuomo involve verbal comments, some women have also alleged that he gave them unwanted kisses or touches. One aide said the governor reached under her shirt and groped her breast at the governor’s mansion in Albany."
women,"To date, Cuomo has rebuffed calls to step down and has moved ahead with plans to run for a fourth term in 2022."
women,"Associated Press writers Jennifer Peltz in New York, David Klepper in Providence, R.I., and Mike Catalini in Trenton, N.J., contributed."
women,House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) made a twisted joke on Saturday about how it would be “hard” not to strike Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) with her own gavel if he ever replaces her as speaker of the House.
women,"He made the startling comment after being given an oversized gavel by members of Tennessee’s congressional delegation at the Statemen’s Dinner, a GOP fundraising event in Nashville."
women,"“I want you to watch Nancy Pelosi hand me that gavel. It will be hard not to hit her with it, but I will bang it down,” he said."
women,"The remark, which was met by laughter from the 1,400 gathered GOP donors, was recorded by Main Street Nashville reporter Vivian Jones, who posted it on Twitter. The gavel presented to McCarthy was labeled with the words “Fire Pelosi.”"
women,Pelosi’s spokesperson Drew Hammill quickly condemned McCarthy’s comment. 
women,"“A threat of violence to someone who was a target of a January 6th assassination attempt from your fellow Trump supporters is irresponsible and disgusting,” he said in a tweet."
women,Pelosi apparently struck a nerve last week when she called McCarthy a “moron” over his opposition of a new mask mandate in the House of Representatives due to rising cases of the delta variant of COVID-19. 
women,"Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) was outraged by McCarthy’s comments, drawing a contrast to Pelosi’s past support for the Violence Against Women Act. “When someone shows you who they are, believe them,” she tweeted."
women,And that was just the start of the criticism against McCarthy from his congressional colleagues.
women,New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) denied sexual harassment allegations against him on Tuesday in a bizarre press conference that included moments of belittlement and a slideshow of him kissing people.
women,The 63-year-old’s address immediately followed the state attorney general concluding that he did sexually harass multiple current and former state government employees and created a “hostile work environment for women.”
women,Here are some of the most bizarre moments:
women,He shared a slideshow of him kissing people.
women,The governor shared a 20-second slideshow featuring photos of him kissing various people and touching their faces as a defense for allegations of unwelcome touching.
women,"“I do it with everyone,” he said as the photos rolled by. “Black and white, young and old, straight and LGBTQ, powerful people. Friends, strangers, people who I meet on the street.”"
women,"Cuomo said his habit of touching and kissing people’s faces is meant to convey warmth and is a habit that he learned from his mother. He did not say he will stop, even after several women accused his behavior of being sexual and unwelcome."
women,He belittled kissing and touching people without their consent.
women,"“I’ve been making the same gesture in public all my life,” he said. “There are hundreds, if not thousands, of photos of me using the exact same gesture.”"
women,He did say he has “learned” from this.
women,He belittled having used pet names for women in his workplace.
women,"“I now understand that there are generational or cultural perspectives that frankly I hadn’t fully appreciated and I have learned from this,” he said."
women,"Cuomo, who has been accused of calling a female aide “sweetheart” and “darling” and putting his hand around her waist, attempted to diminish complaints that he uses inappropriate pet names and terms of endearment for women."
women,"“I do on occasion say, ‘Ciao bella,’” he said of the Italian phrase for “Hi, beautiful.” “On occasion, I do slip and say sweetheart or darling, or honey. I do banter with people,” he said. “I am the same person in public as I am in private.”"
women,"“Even if the person ‘means nothing to you’ or you have ‘used the term for years’ you should be aware that such expressions are inappropriate,” the DOI’s website states. Physical contact and squeezing a worker’s shoulders or putting a hand around their waist are other listed examples of sexual harassment. "
women,"Immediately after identifying his own inappropriate behavior in the workplace, Cuomo said he wants New York state government to be a “model of office behavior.”"
women,He wants his office to be used as a model for office behavior.
women,Using such terms of endearment for another person is not only inappropriate but considered sexual harassment by the U.S. Department of the Interior’s Office of Civil Rights.
women,"“I’ve brought in an expert to design a new sexual harassment policy and procedures and to train the whole team, myself included. I accept responsibility and we are making changes,” he said. "
women,He went on a tangent about sexist double standards.
women,Cuomo switched gears to talk about how unfair it is that women face sexist double standards in the workplace and that this “must be challenged.”
women,"“When have you ever seen male managers maligned and villainized for working long hours or holding people accountable or for being tough? A strong male manager is respected and rewarded, but a strong female manager is ridiculed and stereotyped,” he said. “It is a double standard. It is sexist and it must be challenged.”"
women,He countered the AG’s findings by sharing his attorney’s findings.
women,"“My attorney, who is a non-political former federal prosecutor, has done a response to each allegation and the facts are much different than what has been portrayed. That document is on my website,” he said. In the report, his attorney called James’ investigation biased and accused it of having “willfully ignored evidence inconsistent with the narrative they have sought.”"
women,"Cuomo countered the state attorney general’s investigation into the allegations against him by advertising the results of a report on the allegations from his own attorney, which he said can be found online."
women,He praised his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
women,"The investigation by New York state Attorney General Letitia James was launched in March and included interviews with 179 people, and reviewed more than 74,000 pieces of evidence, including emails, texts, photos and audio files, James said. Her 168-page report was released Tuesday."
women,"Cuomo, while facing growing calls for him to resign, ended his press conference by praising his handling of the coronavirus pandemic and stressing that the work lying ahead of him in office is ongoing, which he repeatedly emphasized can only be done “together.”"
women,"“Look at the progress we made on COVID. It is amazing. We went from the highest infection rate in the country to one of the lowest infection rates in the country,” he said. “That shows that there’s nothing that we can’t do when we work together. Together. Together as one. As one community. As one family.”"
women,U.S. swimmer Simone Manuel overcame burnout and depression to earn her fifth career medal at the Tokyo Olympics. But she can’t get over reporters immediately getting in the faces of competitors who struggle at the Games.
women,"Manuel herself dealt with the blow of not advancing to the 50-meter freestyle final in Tokyo. But she won a bronze medal on the U.S. 4x100 relay to add to a formidable collection of Olympic hardware: a 2016 gold in the 100-meter freestyle as she became the first Black woman to win an individual Summer Games swimming event; a silver in the 50, and a gold and silver in two Rio relays."
women,"“Please stop interviewing athletes right after a disappointing performance before they have any time to process anything,” Manuel wrote on Twitter Friday. “Trust me. They gave it their all. Nothing else people need to know at that time.”"
women,"Premier gymnast Simone Biles, who disclosed she was affected by mental health concerns in this year’s Olympics, faced scrutiny after dropping out of several events in Tokyo before taking a bronze in the balance beam. Though Biles received an outpouring of support, British TV personality Piers Morgan said athletes like her are making it fashionably heroic to “quit.”"
women,Manuel’s comment expanded the dialogue on the role of media after tennis star Naomi Osaka declined to do press appearances at the French Open to protect her mental health. She reappeared at the Olympics two months later and said the pressure “was a bit much” after she lost in the third round.
women,"Twitter accounts for Queen Elizabeth; Prince William and Kate Middleton; Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall all posted photos and messages for Meghan on Wednesday."
women,"Despite strained relations between Prince Harry and Meghan Markle and the British royal family, the Duchess of Sussex still received birthday wishes from her family members across the pond."
women,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s Twitter account wrote, “Wishing a happy 40th birthday to The Duchess of Sussex!” alongside a photo of Meghan at Bondi Beach in Sydney in October 2018."
women,"The picture was taken during the Sussexes tour of Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand."
women,Charles and Camilla’s shared account also wrote a birthday message to the royal. 
women,"“Wishing The Duchess of Sussex a very happy 40th birthday,” the tweet reads, with a photo of Meghan from a Queens Commonwealth Trust and One Young World event in October 2019. "
women,"The Twitter account representing Queen Elizabeth (as well as some other members of the British royal family) posted three photos of the duchess, including a picture of the queen and Meghan at their first official royal engagement together."
women,"Other photos the queen’s account posted included Harry, Meghan and their son Archie meeting with Archbishop Desmond Tutu during their tour of South Africa in 2019, and a shot of the Sussexes at the Endeavour Fund Awards in London in March 2020, months after announcing their royal exit."
women,"The duo’s outing took place in Cheshire, England, in June 2018, just after Meghan and Harry tied the knot."
women,The most personal message came from Harry’s cousin Princess Eugenie who posted a heartfelt note about the Duchess of Sussex on her Instagram story. 
women,"The princess said that she would be participating in Meghan’s 40x40 initiative designed to help women returning to the workplace, which the duchess announced Wednesday with the help of her friend, actor Melissa McCarthy. "
women,"“To celebrate dear Meghan’s 40th birthday I’m contributing 40 minutes of mentorship to support women reentering the workforce,” Eugenie wrote, asking followers to contribute their time as well."
women,"Many notable men and women have signed up to contribute their time through Meghan’s program, including Adele, José Andrés, Amanda Gorman, Debra Messing, Amanda Nguyen, Deepak Chopra, Dr. Ibram X. Kendi and Gloria Steinem."
women,"Taylor Swift spent the pandemic lockdown producing multiple chart-topping albums, but she knows the rest of us spent a lot of our time doing puzzles, which proved to be a fairly useless hobby ... until now. "
women,"Waking up Thursday morning happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time ― well, at least happy and confused ― fans of the singer were treated to a cryptic video teasing songs that will be on the new version of her album “Red,” which originally came out in 2012."
women,"“Level: casually cruel in the name of being honest,” Swift wrote alongside the video, referencing a lyric from Jake Gyllenhaal’s least favorite song, “All Too Well.”"
women,"The video — which she said made her cackle “maniacally” — shows a series of jumbled words shooting out of a vault, all cast in a deep red."
women,"Swift pulled a similar, albeit slightly less intricate, stunt ahead of the release of her new version of “Fearless,” which came out in April. She is currently in the process of re-recording her first six albums, which are owned by her former record label Big Machine — an endeavor she is undertaking to regain control of her entire discography."
women,"It didn’t take fans too long to start decoding the message in the video, which turned out to be an Easter Egg-filled word-search puzzle. "
women,"Soon enough, eagle-eyed Swifties spotted “Phoebe Bridgers,” “Sheeran” and “Chris Stapleton,” signaling that the “Kyoto” singer, Swift’s frequent collaborator Ed Sheeran, and the Grammy-winning country star would appear on the album. "
women,"Hidden within the puzzle were also teases like “All Too Well Ten Minute Version,” “Babe,” “Ronan” and “Better Man,” which refer to a handful of bonus tracks that fans had already deduced would be included on the upcoming record."
women,"But there were also some previously unknown song titles like “Message In A Bottle,” “Forever Winter,” “Think About Me,” “Nothing New,” and “The Very First Night.”"
women,"Before the internet could totally figure the puzzle out, Swift followed up her initial post with another hint. "
women,"“Your next clue will be in the spot where you hear red…,” she wrote, which fans took to refer to a lyric from the album’s title track about “trying to solve a crossword and realizing there’s no right answer.”"
women,"Swift ended her social media spree on Thursday with a photo of herself and one of her cats with the words “I Unlocked The Vault” written across it, indicating that many of the previously unreleased songs embedded in the puzzle will be included on the album."
women,"In June, she announced that the new version of the beloved 2012 album will contain a whopping 30 songs ― one of which she teased is “even ten minutes long.” "
women,"“Musically and lyrically, ‘Red’ resembled a heartbroken person. It was all over the place, a fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end,” she said. “Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild, and tortured by memories past. Like trying on pieces of a new life, I went into the studio and experimented with different sounds and collaborators. And I’m not sure if it was pouring my thoughts into this album, hearing thousands of your voices sing the lyrics back to me in passionate solidarity, or if it was simply time, but something was healed along the way.”"
women,“Red (Taylor’s Version)” is set for release on Nov. 19.
women,Quan Hongchan of China is 14 years old and had never competed in a major diving meet until the Tokyo Olympics.
women,No problem.
women,"All the kid did on Thursday was record two perfect 10s ― that’s a 10 from all seven judges on two dives, followed later by another dive that scored 10 from six of the judges ― to win the gold medal in the woman’s 10-meter platform."
women,"Clearly. Watch the phenom rack up the 10s, to which an announcer says: “You may never see anything like it again.”"
women,"“I want to make enough money to support her,” Quan said through an interpreter. “I listen to my coach very carefully and follow his instructions very carefully.”"
women,"Quan dedicated her startling victory to her ill mother, The Associated Press reported."
women,"Detectives served Houston’s lawyers on Thursday with a notice for him to appear in a Sydney court on Oct. 5 for allegedly concealing a serious indictable offense, police said."
women,"CANBERRA, Australia (AP) — The founder of the Sydney-based global Hillsong Church, Brian Houston, has been charged with concealing child sex offenses, police said Thursday."
women,"“Police will allege in court the man (Houston) knew information relating to the sexual abuse of a young male in the 1970s and failed to bring that information to the attention of police,” police said."
women,"Houston, 67, suggested the charges related to allegations that his preacher father, Frank Houston, had abused a boy over several years in the 1970s."
women,"“These charges have come as a shock to me given how transparent I’ve always been about this matter,” Houston said. “I vehemently profess my innocence and will defend these charges, and I welcome the opportunity to set the record straight.”"
women,Hillsong said in a statement the church was disappointed that Houston had been charged and asked that he be afforded the presumption of innocence and due process.
women,A government inquiry into institutional responses to allegations of child sex abuse found in 2015 that Houston did not tell police that his father was a child sex abuser.
women,The inquiry found that Houston became aware of allegations against his father in 1999 and allowed him to retire quietly rather report him to police. His father confessed to the abuse before he died in 2004 at age 82.
women,"There was media speculation that the inquiry’s findings and the ensuing police investigation were reasons why the White House rejected a request by Australia’s Pentecostal prime minister, Scott Morrison, that Houston be invited to a 2019 state dinner hosted by then-President Donald Trump."
women,"Morrison confirmed that he had wanted Houston, whom he’d known “for a long time,” included on the invitation list. Morrison said he didn’t know why Houston wasn’t invited."
women,"Houston has been based in the United States in recent months, preached at a service in Mexico last month and delivered a livestreamed sermon from California on Sunday, Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported."
women,Freddie Prinze Jr. did not pioneer hacky sack performance art for his legacy to be disrespected like this. 
women,"The first trailer for “He’s All That,” Netflix’s gender-swapped remake of the 1999 teen classic “She’s All That,” starring TikTok influencer and the world’s briefest UFC correspondent Addison Rae has arrived. "
women,"Apart from welcome appearances by the original film’s stars Matthew Lillard and Rachel Leigh Cook, the whole endeavor feels a bit Laney Boggs-ed down by Rae, who, in her acting debut, takes on the role of an Instagram-obsessed queen bee tasked with transforming an outcast into the prom king. "
women,"This time around, obvious hot person Tanner Buchanan of “Cobra Kai” fame is the unwilling participant in the central makeover (“Am I a fucking bet?!”), as Rae’s character attempts to win back some social capital after her breakup goes viral. "
women,"Of course, the two end up falling for each other ― and in literal horse feces ― much to the surprise of Rae’s character’s friend who is inexplicably played by the one and only Kourtney Kardashian."
women,"“Who’s the new guy? A little scruffy, but cute,” the reality star says — dialogue that will surely be submitted for awards contention come Oscars season. "
women,"If all that wasn’t a big enough deterrent, the latter half of the trailer is set to an EDM remix of Sixpence None The Richer’s “Kiss Me” while flashing homages to the original movie (a dance sequence! a red dress! stairs!) before unveiling its Aug. 27 release date. "
women,"In theory, “He’s All That” had all the makings of a worthy remake with “She’s All That” scribe R. Lee Fleming returning to write the script and “Mean Girls” director Mark Waters behind the camera. "
women,"But the internet was quick to blast the trailer and, in a relatively unprecedented move, agree with Jameela Jamil, who said the whole movie “looks objectively Fucking terrible.”"
women,For some other Twitter reactions — and the full trailer — read on.
women,"Lizzo recently delivered a TED Talk ― or rather, a TED Twerk ― discussing the history of the dance and Black culture."
women,"The singer and rapper talked about the origins of twerking on Tuesday at the TEDMonterey “The Case for Optimism” conference, which took place from Aug. 1 to Aug. 4 in Monterey, California. Her full TED Talk is expected to be released this fall."
women,"“Through the movement of twerking I’ve discovered my ass is my greatest asset,” she continued. “Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to TED Twerk.”"
women,"“My ass has been the topic of conversation, my ass has been in magazines, Rihanna gave my ass a standing ovation,” Lizzo, born Melissa Viviane Jefferson, says in a preview clip of her talk. “Yes, my booty. My least favorite part of my body. How did this happen? Twerking.”"
women,"During her TED Talk, Lizzo discussed the history of twerking in Black culture and how its roots trace back to West African dancing, according to a recap of her talk."
women,"In a preview clip of her discussion, Lizzo talks about society’s history of erasing aspects of Black culture, noting: “Black people carry the origins of this dance through our DNA, through our blood, through our bones. We made twerking the global cultural phenomenon it has become today.”"
women,"“I want to add to the classical etymology of this dance. Because it matters,” she continued. “From TikTok trends to songs and humor, we see so much erasure of what Black people have created.”"
women,"“I’m not trying to gatekeep,” she said. “But I’m definitely trying to let you know who built the damn gate.”"
women,Lizzo has shared her joy for twerking over the years. 
women,"Whether the “Cuz I Love You” singer is twerking while playing the flute or twerking at a Los Angeles Lakers game, Lizzo has set the internet abuzz a number of times with her skills. "
women,"Last year, Lizzo posted a video on Instagram of herself twerking as an act of defiance, saying that a man had kicked her and her friends out of a seven-day rental three days early. "
women,"“This is for mocking the way that I dance and for using Instagram footage of me and my 6 black homegirls to say that we could ‘hurt him’ and threaten to call the police,” she wrote in the caption of that post. “I know you’re watching my page so I just want you to know you can’t stop this black girls’ shine.”"
women,"Lizzo’s fans, meanwhile, will have their own reason to twerk soon."
women,"The singer announced on Instagram Monday that she will be releasing her first new song in two years, titled “Rumors,” on Aug. 13."
women,"Reddy, 67, will leave her largely ceremonial role representing the queen in New Zealand in October after a 5-year term. A lawyer who was given the honorific Dame for her services to arts and business, Reddy officially signs bills into law, presides over many public ceremonies and tours the country, meeting with various groups including Indigenous Maori."
women,"WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — The queen’s representative in New Zealand said Prince Harry and Meghan discussed moving to the South Pacific country during their 2018 visit, more than a year before the couple stepped back from royal duties and moved to the United States."
women,Governor-General Patsy Reddy also told The Associated Press in an interview she believes the British monarch should remain New Zealand’s head of state and described the hand-typed letters she sends to Queen Elizabeth II.
women,"Harry and Meghan visited New Zealand at the end of a hectic 16-day royal tour of the South Pacific, and Reddy recalled the couple as being tired."
women,"“I remember they’d just been down to the Abel Tasman National Park when we sat down and had a drink, and they said that they could imagine living in a place like this and wondered whether we thought it would be theoretically possible. Even possible for them to have a place in New Zealand. "
women,"“Of course, we said ‘Sure. It would be fine. There are lots of opportunities to live in New Zealand, but that would be something that they’d have to explore,’” Reddy said. “They were looking at how they might raise their family. And, obviously, they’ve made some decisions since.”"
women,Reddy said she didn’t view it as a formal request for assistance but more of an informal discussion about the couple’s hopes for the future. She said the pair seemed impressed with the access to the outdoors and their interactions with New Zealanders.
women,"Still, the discussion shows the couple were considering options outside of Britain less than six months after they married and well before their eventual move to the U.S."
women,"During a widely watched interview with Oprah Winfrey near the couple’s California home earlier this year, Prince Harry and Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, mentioned they’d offered to the royal family to take a step back from royal life in a Commonwealth country such as South Africa or New Zealand."
women,"“I thought they were a lovely couple and I hope they’ve got a great future where they are,” Reddy said."
women,Reddy said she watched the interview but didn’t want to comment on internal royal family business.
women,"She said she regularly expresses her confidential views of what’s happening in New Zealand to the queen, such as the nation’s response to the pandemic. She said the communication “is quite touchingly old-fashioned, by letter.”"
women,Many people in New Zealand believe the country should become an independent republic but Reddy said she believed the queen should remain the head of state because the arrangement works and has strong historical links.
women,"“She has told me on the times that I’ve seen her that she finds it interesting to have a personal perspective on what’s happening,” Reddy said. “As she says, ‘I like to know what’s happening between the lines.’”"
women,"She said New Zealand has a special connection to the monarchy because its founding document, the Treaty of Waitangi, was signed by Maori and the representative of Queen Victoria."
women,"Asked about a future scenario in which a monarch might turn out to be dictatorial or autocratic, Reddy said the same scenario with an elected president would likely be worse."
women,"“We’ve seen how that doesn’t work in other countries in the world,” she said. “But actually, because the monarch is much more of a theoretical construct, a figurehead rather than an actual ruler, I think it gives us a measure of safety, constitutional safety.”"
women,"Reddy said she agreed with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s assessment that there was currently little appetite among New Zealanders for a constitutional change, and that people were concerned about more pressing issues like climate change, inequality and the pandemic."
women,"She said she thought the royal family had been great role models during the pandemic, using the internet and social media to great effect and abiding fastidiously to the rules imposed by the British government."
women,"“So we saw tragically the funeral of Prince Philip, where they could only have 30 mourners,” Reddy said. “But there was no question that there’d be any kind of dispensation, even from the requirements for isolation, when, for example, Prince Harry came back to that funeral.”"
women,Reddy said she’d watched the Netflix series “The Crown.”
women,"“I’ve enjoyed it as a historical drama,” she said. “Its production values and some great characterizations, I think. But, you know, it’s not real life is it?”"
women,"She pushed back at the negative portrayal of Prince Charles, saying she thought he would be a good monarch."
women,"“I’ve been enormously impressed with the breadth of his knowledge, the depth of his well-considered perceptions on a range of subjects,” she said. “From urban planning to the environment, to the impact of religions on the world.”"
women,"Children’s advocate Cindy Kiro has been named by Ardern to succeed Reddy. Kiro, who is also a Dame, is the first Indigenous woman appointed to the role."
women,"In a caption addressed directly to DaBaby, Cyrus said she “would love to talk and see how we can learn from each other and help be part of making a more just and understanding future!” "
women,"In a note posted to Instagram on Wednesday, the pop star urged DaBaby to “check your DMs” and invited the rapper for an open dialogue following last week’s controversy. "
women,"“As a proud and loyal member of the LGBTQIA+ community, much of my life has been dedicated to encouraging love, acceptance, and open mindedness,” she wrote. “It’s easier to cancel someone than to find forgiveness and compassion in ourselves or take the time to change hearts and minds. There’s no more room for division if we want to keep seeing progress! Knowledge is power! I know I still have so much to learn.”"
women,"She also tagged the Happy Hippie Foundation, an LGBTQ advocacy group she founded in 2014, as well as Greater Than AIDS, which is dedicated to promoting awareness around HIV/AIDS. "
women,Miley Cyrus joined a growing chorus of celebrities this week in speaking out against DaBaby’s homophobic remarks ― but she may be the first to take a proactive approach. 
women,"DaBaby, whose real name is Jonathan Lyndale Kirk, has spent much of the past week in a fog of controversy after making a series of derogatory statements about women, gay men and those living with HIV/AIDS at the Rolling Loud Festival in Miami at the end of July."
women,"TMZ’s footage of the rapper’s performance caught him urging fans to put their phones up “if you didn’t show up today with HIV/AIDS, or other STDs that’ll make you die in two to three weeks.”"
women,"Though DaBaby seemed impervious to the fallout at first, he issued a formal apology on his social media platforms Monday."
women,"The comments drew swift condemnation from stars like Elton John and Madonna. A number of music festivals, including Chicago’s Lollapalooza and New York City’s Governors Ball, dropped the rapper from their lineups. "
women,"“I appreciate the many people who came to me with kindness, who reached out to me privately to offer wisdom, education, and resources,” he wrote. “That’s what I needed and it was received.”"
women,"Megan Rapinoe, one of the U.S. soccer stars in the twilight of her career, turned in a vintage performance to help the team salvage a glimmer of redemption at the Tokyo Olympics on Thursday."
women,"Rapinoe bent in an incredible corner kick in the 8th minute put the U.S. on top, 1-0."
women,"She scored two spectacular goals in a 4-3 victory over Australia in the bronze-medal game, giving the U.S. women’s squad its first third-place finish in the Summer Games. Carli Lloyd added two goals in what will likely be the last Olympics for both all-time greats."
women,"Australia’s Sam Kerr answered 9 minutes later, booting a left-footer into the goal off an assist by Caitlin Foord. "
women,The squad was expected to win its fifth Olympic gold and become the first team to come out on top as the reigning World Cup champs. But uninspired play and a sputtering attack through much of the tournament left them to play for bronze.
women,That was already a 100% increase in scoring production for both squads over their previous scoreless match in the group stage.
women,"Rapinoe volleyed an Australian clearing attempt into the top left corner of the goal, pushing the Americans ahead again, 2-1, in the 21st minute."
women,"Lloyd fielded a ball from Lindsey Horan and knocked it in during the first minute of first-half stoppage to give the U.S. breathing room, 3-1."
women,"She quickly added another in the second half to make it 4-1, becoming the national team’s all-time leading scorer in the Olympics with 10 goals."
women,Emily Gielnik of Australia scored late to tighten the score.
women,Foord shrunk the margin back to two goals a few minutes later with a header in the 54th minute.
women,"Rapinoe, 36, was subbed out by Tobin Heath in the 61st minute and Lloyd, 39, was replaced by Alex Morgan in the 81st. But the soccer icons had done the damage."
women,Rapinoe and Lloyd shared two World Cup victories and have both been honored as the best player in the world. Lloyd has two Olympic gold medals and Rapinoe has one.
women,Rapinoe previously spoke of her frustration that she and Lloyd were not able to win gold at this tournament after the U.S. lost to Canada in the semifinals. But they still had a bronze to win.
women,"“There’s still a lot to compete for,” Rapinoe said before the game. “That’s what I told the girls and what we talked about in the huddle. It’s not the color we want, but there’s still a medal on the line.”"
women,Lloyd was in sync offensively as well.
women,She scored the game-winning goals for the Americans’ 2012 and 2008 gold-medalist teams. This time she provided the cushion for the U.S. to secure bronze.
women,"U.S. Coach Vlatko Andonovski said the team would “do anything possible” to capture a medal and Adrianna Franch, the backup goalie thrust into the starter’s role after Alyssa Naeher’s injury, said beforehand: “The bronze is just as important, because it’s what we have to fight for,” she said."
women,"And fight they did, with Rapinoe and Lloyd leading the way."
women,"Olivia Rodrigo may have given Courtney Love a little déjà vu with a recent photo shoot, but she made it clear this week that any lingering beef was strictly one-sided."
women,"The Disney actor-turned-pop superstar opened up about her rising music career in an interview with GQ published Wednesday. Though she steers clear of specifics regarding Love’s headline-making accusations, she told the magazine, “To be honest, I’m just flattered that Courtney Love knows that I exist.” "
women,"In June, Love publicly called Rodrigo out over the promotional artwork for “Sour Prom,” a livestreamed concert film. One of the images showed Rodrigo in a pink gown and a tiara carrying a bouquet of flowers, with mascara tears streaming down her face."
women,"“My cover was my original idea,” the rock icon wrote in a since-deleted Facebook post. “A thing you maybe have to actually live life to acquire? I don’t know. Anyway. Disney? Yes it’s rude.”"
women,"Rodrigo’s photo shared similarities to the prom queen-themed cover art for “Live Through This,” the 1994 album by Love’s former band, Hole. It may have been an intentional tribute given Rodrigo’s stated preference for 1990s alt-rock, but Love wasn’t feeling it. "
women,"“I’ve informed her I await her flowers snd [sic] note,” she added. “I sure hope it’s long. Does Disney teach kids reading and writing? God knows. Let’s see. Yes this is rude. Rage inducing? Honey if I had a dollar for everyone this happens? I’d be real rich!”"
women,"The remainder of Wednesday’s GQ interview, however, was dedicated to Rodrigo’s smash album, “Sour,” and her plans for the future. She described the ongoing scrutiny over her love life on TikTok and other social media platforms as “really weird.” And as for rumored ex-boyfriend Joshua Bassett, who in June identified as “part of the LGBTQ+ community,” she said, “I know nothing about it, and it’s not my business to speak on it.” "
women,"Later, she admitted she’s been following Britney Spears’ ongoing conservatorship battle “very closely,” and said she could relate to the“Toxic” singer’s professional woes as a young woman in the music business. "
women,"“I think, as an industry, people are getting better at not taking advantage of and manipulating and bullying young women,” she explained. “But it’s still so apparent, and I witness that too. Not near at the level that Britney has, obviously. I think that’s an important paradigm that I hope that we’ll be able to break in the coming generations. I’ve definitely seen corporate dollars be prioritized over people’s mental health.”"
women,Olympic legend Carl Lewis slammed the U.S. men’s 4x100-meter relay team as a “clown show” Thursday after the Americans failed to qualify for the final at the Tokyo Olympics.
women,"The athletes ― Fred Kerley, Ronnie Baker, Trayvon Bromell and Cravon Gillespie — finished their heat sixth after more bungled baton exchanges."
women,Lewis unloaded on Twitter.
women,"“The USA team did everything wrong in the men’s relay,” wrote the nine-time Olympic champion, now assistant track coach at the University of Houston."
women,"Lewis, 60, slammed the team’s baton-passing system and said the athletes ran in the wrong order. There was “no leadership,” he lamented."
women,"“It was a total embarrassment, and completely unacceptable for a USA team to look worse than the AAU kids I saw,” Lewis concluded."
women,"Lewis echoed his fierce criticism in an interview with USA Today, calling the performance a “clown show.”"
women,"“This was a football coach taking a team to the Super Bowl and losing 99-0 because they were completely ill-prepared,” he told the outlet."
women,Skateboarder Misugu Okamoto of Japan finished short of a medal when she fell on her last run in the park finals at the Tokyo Olympics.
women,"Although Okamoto, 15, came in fourth, her fellow competitors made sure she felt like a winner as they hugged her, lifted her up on their shoulders and carried her away."
women,Now that’s sportsmanship.
women,"Japan’s Sakura Yosozumi won the gold medal, ahead of silver medalist Kokona Hiraki of Japan and bronze medalist Sky Brown of Great Britain."
women,"Johnson-Thompson pulled up in the heptathlon 200 meters and crumpled to the track, prompting medics to bring out a wheelchair for her. But the British star rejected the assistance, got to her feet, hobbled for a bit and jogged across the finish line."
women,Reigning world champ heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson won over fans with her persistence after sustaining an injury on Wednesday ― and that’s all she will win in Tokyo.
women,One announcer called the move “a gesture of toughness and resilience ― refusal to be defeated by the injury in this particular discipline.”
women,"Johnson-Thompson was disqualified for running out of her lane and has withdrawn from the competition, the BBC noted."
women,"She entered the games after recovering from an Achilles rupture, but it was a calf injury on a different leg that caused the issue, British Athletics said."
women,Many people on Twitter praised her for finishing the race.
women,"“Tough As Nails!” one fan said, while another wrote, “Much respect.” "
women,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee was hit Tuesday with a second legal challenge aimed at overturning a slate of bills targeting transgender people that Gov. Bill Lee signed into law earlier this year."
women,"Other people expressed concern for Johnson-Thompson’s injury, with one tweeter pointing out that the “working through the pain mentality” can be harmful to athletes."
women,"The federal lawsuit filed by the Human Rights Campaign challenges the state’s “bathroom bill,” a measure that restricts school bathroom use by transgender people."
women,"“Courts have time-and-again ruled against these dangerous and discriminatory laws and we are going to fight in court to strike down this one and protect the civil rights of transgender and non-binary young people,” Human Rights Campaign President Alphonso David said in a statement."
women,"“With our representation of two transgender kids today, we are sending a strong message of support for all transgender and non-binary children across the country — you matter, and your legal rights should be respected,” David added."
women,Tennessee Attorney General spokesperson Samantha Fisher said in an email the office was reviewing the lawsuit.
women,"While numerous anti-LGBTQ measures advanced in GOP-led statehouses across the country, no state’s political leaders went further than Tennessee in enacting new laws targeting transgender people."
women,"Under Tennessee’s bathroom measure, a student, parent or employee can sue in an effort to claim monetary damages “for all psychological, emotional, and physical harm suffered” if school officials allow a transgender person into the bathroom or locker room when others are in there. They also can take legal action if required to stay in the same sleeping quarters as a person who was a member of the opposite sex at birth, unless that person is a family member."
women,"For those transgender students or employees who want more privacy than that afforded by a bathroom designated for their sex at birth, the law says schools must try to offer a bathroom or changing facility that is single-occupancy. Critics of that provision say it could further stigmatize an already marginalized group."
women,"The Human Rights Campaign filed the lawsuit on behalf of two transgender students currently enrolled in Tennessee schools. Specifically, the plaintiffs allege that the law violates Title IX, the 1972 federal law that protects against sex discrimination in education."
women,"“Both options were alienating and isolating for Alex who instead stopped drinking liquids at school to avoid having to use the facilities,” the Human Rights Campaign said in a statement."
women,"The group says one student, identified as Alex, 14, had already been forced to use the school nurse’s private bathroom or the bathroom that corresponded to his gender assigned at birth during seventh grade because of the school’s current policy."
women,"After attending a private school where he was allowed access to the boys restroom when he was in eighth grade, Alex is now preparing to start public high school, where he will once again be forced to choose forgoing the use of the bathroom in order to avoid stigmatization, the lawsuit says."
women,"Meanwhile, the family of 4-year-old Ariel says school officials were understanding of her gender identity in kindergarten and protected her from “stigmatizing experiences,” including by allowing her to use the girls restroom. However, the family says that when she enters the first grade, Ariel will either have to use the boys restroom or the private nurse’s bathroom."
women,The Human Rights Campaign says both families are considering moving out of state.
women,"In June, however, the U.S. Education Department announced it would expand its interpretation of federal sex protections to include transgender and gay students. The new policy directive means that discrimination based on a student’s sexual orientation or gender identity will be treated as a violation of Title IX."
women,"So far nationally, there has been no big, tangible repercussion where bills have passed targeting transgender people, unlike the swift backlash from the business community to North Carolina’s 2016 “bathroom bill.”"
women,"Just weeks later, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a Virginia school board’s appeal to reinstate its transgender bathroom ban. While LGBTQ advocates declared the ruling a key victory for transgender rights, the court’s decision did not set a national precedent, which means the Tennessee case must still move through the court system."
women,"Earlier this year, the American Civil Liberties Union challenged Tennessee’s first-of-its-kind law that requires businesses and government facilities to post signs if they let transgender people use multi-person public bathrooms of their choice. A judge has since blocked it from being implemented as the lawsuit makes it way through court. "
women,Camila Cabello is the new belle of the ball in the first trailer for Amazon’s upcoming spin on the classic fairy tale “Cinderella.” 
women,Given just how many iterations of the scrappy princess we’ve seen over the years ― let’s all agree that we peaked with Brandy’s version ― it should come as no surprise that a modern musical adaptation of her story would contain some updates.
women,"This time around, Cinderella, played by pop star and former Fifth Harmonizer Camila Cabello in her feature film debut, is far more interested in launching her own business ― a clothing line named Dresses by Ella ― than swooning over Prince Charming (Nicholas Galitzine)."
women,"She’ll not only have to overcome her evil stepmother, played by Idina Menzel, and the requisite stepsisters, but also the forces that keep her from making a life and a brand for herself."
women,"“Here’s a laugh, this girl fancies herself a businessman,” one townsperson yells in the trailer, as Cinderella’s sartorial venture draws more jeers than cheers."
women,"Written and directed by “Pitch Perfect” scribe Kay Cannon, “Cinderella” also boasts new musical numbers, including original songs by Cabello and Menzel, as well as pop classics like Janet Jackson’s “Rhythm Nation” ― performed by the townspeople in the trailer ― and Jennifer Lopez’s “Let’s Get Loud.”"
women,"And then, there’s Billy Porter as the nonbinary fairy godmother — known here as “the Fab G” ― who transforms Cabello’s Cinderella into the pantsuit-wearing businesswoman of her dreams, before she opts for more ball-appropriate attire."
women,Cannon described the project as a jukebox musical featuring hit songs throughout the decades within a story that she hopes will better capture the experience of young women today.
women,"“I just felt like it was a great opportunity to show this loved, iconic character that is Cinderella in a way that’s more relatable to what girls and young women in particular are going through, where they can really see themselves,” she told Entertainment Weekly last month. "
women,"“Cinderella,” which also stars Pierce Brosnan, Minnie Driver, James Corden and Missy Elliot, arrives Sept. 3 on Amazon Prime Video. "

women,House Speaker Nancy Pelosi put aside her four-decade friendship with the Cuomo family and called on New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to resign amid allegations of sexual harassment corroborated by an in-depth investigation from the New York state attorney general.
women,"“Under Attorney General Letitia James, a comprehensive and independent investigation into the allegations against Governor Cuomo has been completed,” Pelosi said in a statement. “As always, I commend the women who came forward to speak their truth. Recognizing his love of New York and the respect for the office he holds, I call upon the Governor to resign.”"
women,"The Pelosi and Cuomo families have been close friends for over 40 years. Mario Cuomo, Andrew Cuomo’s father, endorsed Pelosi to be the chair of the Democratic National Committee in 1984, when Mario Cuomo was the governor of New York. Mario Cuomo and Pelosi traveled to Italy together after the 1980 earthquake that killed nearly 3,000 people. Pelosi also invited Matilda Cuomo, Andrew Cuomo’s mother, to Pope Francis’ address to Congress in 2015."
women,"In March, Pelosi told ABC News the allegations against Cuomo were “credible and serious,” adding that there is “zero tolerance for sexual harassment.” When asked if the New York governor should resign, Pelosi was less forthcoming: “The governor should look inside his heart ... to see if he can govern effectively.”"
women,"Eleven women accused the New York governor of sexual harassment including sexual comments and unwanted touching. New York Attorney General Letitia James said that Cuomo and his senior team created a hostile work environment for women. The evidence painted a “deeply disturbing yet clear picture” that Cuomo sexually harassed female employees, many of whom were young women, James said."
women,"
Cuomo denied the allegations later on Tuesday, telling reporters he “never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances.”
President Joe Biden called on Cuomo to resign in the wake of the New York attorney general’s findings. Prominent New York Democrats including U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) released statements urging Cuomo to step down. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) said it’s “beyond clear that Andrew Cuomo is not fit to hold office.”
Democratic members of the New York State Assembly held a meeting Tuesday afternoon to discuss the possibility of impeachment after Cuomo held a bizarre press briefing in which he did not announce his resignation and insisted that the investigation’s findings were biased.
“Now that the investigation is complete and the allegations have been substantiated, it should be clear to everyone that he can no longer serve as governor,” New York state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins said in a statement.New York state Assembly member Yuh-Line Niou, an outspoken critic of Cuomo’s, said she has already drafted articles of impeachment.“I had them drafted yesterday,” Niou said. “I had them drafted months ago.”"
women,"Though New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) remains defiant in the face of a damning sexual harassment report, the calls for his resignation have already begun."
women,"Several New York lawmakers, including U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), have released statements urging Cuomo to step down, following an investigation from the New York state attorney general’s office that found the governor sexually harassed at least 11 women."
women,"“The New York State Attorney General has conducted an independent, thorough and professional investigation that found the Governor violated state and federal law, had a pattern of sexually harassing current and former employees, retaliated against at least one of the accusers and created a hostile work environment,” Schumer and Gillibrand said in a joint statement released Tuesday afternoon."
women,"“No elected official is above the law,” Schumer and Gillibrand added. “The people of New York deserve better leadership in the governor’s office. We continue to believe that the Governor should resign.”"
women,"Schumer and Gillibrand, along with several other prominent New York Democrats, called for Cuomo to resign in March when women first came out with accusations of sexual harassment against the governor. Now, many are doubling down after the attorney general’s investigation corroborated Cuomo’s misconduct. "
women,"New York state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D) said that “the Governor must resign for the good of the state.” New York state Assemblymember Yuh-Line Niou, an outspoken critic of Cuomo, said she has already drafted articles of impeachment. "
women,"Eric Adams, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, said in a statement that it’s “the duty of the New York State Assembly to take swift and appropriate action and move forward with impeachment proceedings if the Governor will not resign.”"
women,Various state lawmakers also called for Cuomo’s resignation in light of the investigation’s findings.
women,"“It took 179 witnesses and a statewide investigation by the Attorney General to hold one powerful man accountable,” Niou told reporter Eoin Higgins. “Tell me again that New York doesn’t have a power problem.”"
women,"U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) went so far as to call for Cuomo’s arrest, adding that President Joe Biden must immediately call for the governor’s resignation."
women,"U.S. Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) said he believes Cuomo’s behavior is “disqualifying,” adding that “today is a very, very sad day in the history of our state. In order to move forward, we need to have new leadership.”"
women,"“No one is above the law and today justice must be served,” Stefanik said Tuesday. “In December, I was the first federal official to publicly call for an independent investigation into Governor Cuomo’s sexual harassment, abuse, and assault ... The media and Democrats smeared me and closed ranks to protect Cuomo, a shameful chapter in New York history. All of them including his staff must be held to account. These brave women deserve swift and definitive justice.”"
women,"In March, Biden said Cuomo should resign if the sexual harassment allegations against the governor were confirmed. Biden stood by his initial comments during a Tuesday press conference. “I stand by that statement,” Biden said. “I think that he should resign.”"
women,"Other New York lawmakers ― including U.S. Reps. Tom Suozzi, Hakeem Jeffries and Gregory Meeks, all Democrats ― have also urged Cuomo to step down in light of the state attorney general’s findings."
women,New York state Attorney General Letitia James announced her office’s findings in a Tuesday news conference. She said that Cuomo “sexually harassed current and former New York State employees by engaging in unwelcome and non-consensual touching and making numerous offensive comments of a suggestive and sexual nature that created a hostile work environment for women.”
women,"
The report found that the governor sexually harassed 11 women, including a state trooper assigned to his protective detail, members of the public and current and former staff members. Nine women accused Cuomo of sexual harassment and inappropriate comments earlier this year.
"
women,"James’ office spoke with 179 people for the investigation and reviewed more than 74,000 pieces of evidence, including emails, texts, photos and audio files. The evidence painted a “deeply disturbing yet clear picture” that Cuomo sexually harassed female employees, many of whom were young women, James said."
women,"Cuomo denied all accusations of sexual harassment in a bizarre press conference on Tuesday. The governor blamed the findings on biased reporting, and said the investigation “sought to unfairly characterize and weaponize everyday actions” that he’s had with those accusing him of harassment."
women,"A handful of women’s organizations, including UltraViolet, Me Too and the National Women’s Law Center, released statements urging Cuomo to step down. The NWLC criticized Cuomo for his press conference, accusing him of taking no responsibility for his alleged actions. "
women,"“Governor Cuomo’s insulting defense of his actions will also sound familiar to countless survivors who have had their legitimacy questioned and their pain challenged by the very people who inflicted that pain,” said Fatima Goss Graves, the president and CEO of NWLC."
women,"“No individual should be exempt from consequences, especially not those who rely on their profile or powerful position to avoid accountability,” she went on. “Justice for survivors includes accountability, and that applies here as well: Cuomo must resign ― or be removed from office ― immediately.”"

women,Simone Biles earned a bronze medal Tuesday with gold-medal fortitude.
women,"She didn’t shrink from it. Biles appeared confident in her more conservative balance beam routine and nailed a double-pike dismount. It wasn’t vintage Biles, who won the world championship on the beam in 2019, but it was mature Biles."

women,"Biles, looking confident, had just minor flaws in her routine and then delivered a resounding double-pike dismount. She got hugs from the other competitors, and she jumped up and down."
women,Simone Biles’ much-awaited return to competition at the Tokyo Olympics Tuesday wasn’t quite a fairy-tale ending. But the highly decorated U.S. gymnast still pulled out a hard-fought bronze medal on the balance beam.
women,Her much-awaited return after struggling with mental-health concerns and disorientation during her acrobatics put the spotlight firmly on the athlete who’s widely considered the best gymnast ever.
women,"“I had nerves, but I felt pretty good,” she said, reported The Associated Press."
women,"“I’ll treasure this one a lot more after everything I have been through,” she said."
women,"The color of the medal seemed irrelevant, and the achievement left Biles, 24, with seven medals, tied with Shannon Miller for the most won by an American gymnast. One of them was a bronze on the beam at the 2016 Rio Olympics."
women,Reports from Monday noted that Biles looked solid in practice and was smiling.
women,That same Biles appeared Tuesday when it counted.
women,"She tied Shannon Miller as the most decorated U.S. gymnast, with seven medals in her Olympic career. (But she has two more golds than Miller.)"
women,"She dropped out of the team competition after an awkward vault, citing concerns over her mental health. The team captured a silver medal in her absence."
women,"Noting that she was still getting lost in the air during acrobatic moves, Biles pulled out of three of the four individual events. Americans responded with medal-winning performances. MyKayla Skinner, her replacement in the vault, took silver; Lee grabbed bronze in the uneven bars; and Jade Carey delivered with a gold in the floor exercise."
women,Biles’ frankness about her emotional well-being and her disorientation ― called the “twisties” ― opened dialogue about the pressure of elite sports. She had to defend herself against critics who say she quit.
women,"Teammate Sunisa Lee, who supplanted Biles as the all-around champion, nearly fell after a difficult sequence and finished fifth."
women,USA Gymnastics on Monday announced her return to competition at the games with exclamation points.
women,Biles took an unexpected route to what turned out to be her lone individual event.
women,"She then withdrew from the all-around, and Lee won the coveted title previously held by her famous teammate."
women,"Biles won bronze on the beam in the 2016 Olympics ― her only non-gold among five medals ― but she was the 2019 world champion. Lee, who has won gold (all-round), silver (team) and bronze (uneven bars) at these Olympics, conceded earlier that the beam was not exactly her favorite event."
women,"After her somewhat disappointing third place in her best event, the uneven bars, Lee said, “I just wish the bronze medal was on beam or something.”"
women,"Guan Chenchen of China, performing last, won gold with a score of 14.633. Tang Xijing of China got the silver with 14.233 and Biles notched a 14.00."
women,New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) came out punching during a news conference Tuesday afternoon in response to the state attorney general’s investigation that found he sexually harassed at least 11 women during his time as governor. 
women,"In a weird turn of events, Cuomo also brought up that someone in his family is a survivor of sexual assault. He said he tried to use his experience with his family member to get closer to Charlotte Bennett, one of his accusers who had disclosed to him that she was a survivor of sexual assault."
women,Cuomo outright denied all of the allegations against him in a 15-minute monologue during which members of the media were not able to ask questions. The governor blamed the investigation’s outcome on biased reporting by the lead investigators tapped by state Attorney General Letitia James. Cuomo said the allegations against him “sought to unfairly characterize and weaponize everyday actions” he’s had with those accusing him of harassment. 
women,"“I want you to know directly from me that I never touched anyone inappropriately or made inappropriate sexual advances,” Cuomo said. “I am 63 years old. I’ve lived my entire adult life in public view. That is just not who I am and that’s not who I have ever been.” "
women,The governor said he was “truly and deeply sorry” for sharing his personal experiences at work and acknowledged that it wasn’t helpful.
women,"The governor remained defiant throughout his speech and even went so far as to display a slideshow of him kissing people’s cheeks in order to show how his alleged interactions with certain women are not inappropriate. The slideshow included a photo of Cuomo’s mother kissing him and another image of his father kissing him to show that he learned this interaction from his parents and it’s “meant to convey warmth, nothing more,” the governor said. "
women,"“The truth is that her story resonated deeply with me,” Cuomo said of Bennett’s story of sexual assault. “I had heard the same story before with the same ugliness, the same injustice, the same damage. Not only had I heard the story before, I had lived the story before. My family member is a survivor of sexual assault in high school. I have watched her live and suffer with the trauma. I would do anything to make it go away for her, but it never really goes away.”"
women,"“I do it with everyone: Black and white, young and old, straight and LGBTQ, powerful people, friends, strangers, people who I meet on the street,” Cuomo said of kissing."
women,"Bennett responded to the investigation and Cuomo’s press conference in a tweet, writing, “We have the facts. @NYGovCuomo broke federal & state law when he sexually harassed me & other current & former staff. I do not want an apology — I want accountability and an end to victim-blaming.”"
women,Bennett tagged New York state Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D) and implored him to “do the right thing” and impeach Cuomo. 
women,"Cuomo went on to suggest that some people are using “this moment” for politics, publicity and personal gain, and accused them of discrediting other sexual harassment victims."
women,"
The attorney general’s office spoke with 179 people for the investigation and reviewed more than 74,000 pieces of evidence, including emails, texts, photos and audio files. The evidence painted a “deeply disturbing yet clear picture” that Cuomo sexually harassed female employees, many of whom were young women, James said.
Several lawmakers have already called for Cuomo’s resignation in the wake of the attorney general’s findings. New York state Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D) said that “the Governor must resign for the good of the state.” Congresswoman Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) urged Cuomo to resign and called for his arrest, adding that Biden must immediately call for the governor’s resignation.
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) released a joint statement following Cuomo’s news conference calling for the governor to step down.“The New York State Attorney General has conducted an independent, thorough and professional investigation that found the Governor violated state and federal law, had a pattern of sexually harassing current and former employees, retaliated against at least one of the accusers and created a hostile work environment,” the senators said. “No elected official is above the law. The people of New York deserve better leadership in the governor’s office. We continue to believe that the Governor should resign.”In March, President Joe Biden said Cuomo should resign if the sexual harassment allegations against the governor were confirmed. Biden said Tuesday during a news conference that he stands by his original statement: “I think that he should resign.”"
women,"
James said in a Tuesday news conference that Cuomo “sexually harassed current and former New York State employees by engaging in unwelcome and non-consensual touching and making numerous offensive comments of a suggestive and sexual nature that created a hostile work environment for women.”
"
women,"Black women make 63 cents to every dollar white men make. Viewed another way, it takes an extra eight months and three days for Black women to make what white men made the prior calendar year. According to the National Women’s Law Center, this disparity has only closed three cents in the past 30 years. "
women,"It also takes Black women longer to find work than their white peers. Over the course of a 40-year career, Black women lose out on $946,120. "
women,"Aug. 3, 2021, is Black Women’s Pay Day. It marks the day that Black women finally catch up to what non-Hispanic white men made in the year 2020. "
women,"A new report for the American Association of University Women outlines how generations of systemic injustice have directly fueled the race and gender pay gap. From the end of enslavement to de facto and de jure segregation and beyond, Black women at large have never had the privilege of economic freedom. "
women,"When conversations about pay equity first began, race was left out of the discussion, ignoring the unique experiences of Black women and other women of color, Gloria Blackwell, senior vice president at the American Association of University Women, told HuffPost. She said AAUW’s latest report outlining those historical inequities aims to address that."
women,"“Even after the end of Black Americans’ enslavement, there were policies put in place to ensure that Black women and Black men didn’t have the opportunity to move ahead and/or create or build wealth in any context,” Blackwell said. "
women,"Black women were working “very low-paying jobs that offered no protections ... as maids and housekeepers,” she continued. “They were working in the service industry, so the perpetuation of the low-wage hourly jobs continues to this day.”"
women,"In May 2020, during the pandemic, the unemployment rate for Black women reached 16.6% and remained in the double digits for the next six months, according to NWLC’s latest report. In June 2021, their unemployment rate fell to 8.5%, but it was still 1.7 times more than their unemployment rate prior to the pandemic. "
women,"“Black women were also shuffled into industries where there were fewer protections,” Blackwell added. “There was no way for them to have health insurance or paid sick leave, ways that they were able to build any kind of wealth, no way to have a flexible work schedule.”"
women,"In order for there to be systemic change, Blackwell said, there needs to be “drastic policy change that keeps in mind the intersection of race and gender.” And while Black women have made some gains, the economic downturn due to the COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted them."
women,"Though there isn’t sufficient data to say the pandemic definitively widened the pay gap between white men and Black women, Blackwell said, “it’s been pretty clear from the research that has come out that some of the gains we’ve seen over the past several decades at least may have been erased and the pay gap itself is going to take longer to close.”"
women,"Blackwell noted that most of the jobs lost during the pandemic were service jobs mentioned in the report that employ a large number of Black women, including in retail, hospitality and tourism. In addition, many Black women, especially mothers, have had to take on financial stresses related to coronavirus as the sole or primary breadwinners in their households."
women,"Blackwell said that though states have their own pay equity laws, it’s vital that they are enforced. She said that new policy, especially for the post-pandemic era, must focus on child care support, paid leave and protections against sexual, racial and other kinds of harassment in the workplace. "
women,"“So we see the pandemic as increasing the negativity around Black women’s ability to move forward in their careers, to be able to create and build wealth, to be able to have some of the flexibility and some of the career level support that are really important in a career,” she said."
women,"“Student loans figure into this as well,” Blackwell said. “We know Black women have more student loan debt overall. And many of these stop-gap measures, housing, student loans, many of these things are left to fall by the wayside and people have to start pretending that the pandemic never happened. They’re going to have an inordinate impact, a greater impact on Black women. Black women’s earning power has clearly been hurt by the pandemic, and that will certainly contribute to a widened pay gap.”"
women,"Employers must be transparent, too, and provide data on who’s being paid what to identify where pay inequity exists. She added that no company should be asking about job candidates’ pay history, because “it’s another trap” that hinders women from receiving fair pay."
women,"“People talk about the pay gap in this tiny little area; they don’t understand the ramifications of what that means,” Blackwell said. “In over a 40-year career, Black women lose on average nearly a million dollars when you compare it to white men. I think there’s a lot Black women could do if they had a million dollars over that time. We could definitely chip away at the wealth gap that keeps Black women and their families constantly struggling, not just to get ahead, but to maintain and keep up.”"
women,"Dutch distance star Sifan Hassan tripped over another runner in a 1,500-meter heat at the Tokyo Olympics on Monday ― and it looked bad for her. With less than 400 meters to go, she was sprawled on the track and trailed the pack by a considerable distance."
women,"But she got up ― and then some. Hassan turned on her burners to win the heat. She covered the ground from tumble to finish line in about 62 seconds, the announcer estimated."
women,"Hassan later blew away concerns that expending all that energy would deplete her for the 5,000-meter final later in the day. In the end, she won and remains on track in her attempt to win gold in the 1,500, 5,000 and 10,000."
women,The network and Napolitano have since parted ways.
women,"Fawcett said in the lawsuit that he reported Napolitano’s misconduct to the network’s human resources department, but no one took any immediate action against him. However, in a statement provided to HuffPost, Fox News said that “upon first learning of John Fawcett’s allegations against Judge Andrew Napolitano, Fox News Media immediately investigated the claims and addressed the matter with both parties.”"
women,Fox News has ended its relationship with legal analyst and former judge Andrew Napolitano after a sexual harassment lawsuit was filed on Monday.
women,"Napolitano was accused of sexual assault last year by a North Carolina man and by a waiter in New Jersey, where Napolitano used to be a judge.Napolitano denied the accusations and the network stood by him. "
women,"Fawcett, who’s an associate producer on former White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow’s program on Fox Business, also alleged that Kudlow had “used ethnic slurs and made sexually inappropriate comments about women in front of multiple staff members.” The suit also claims that Kudlow “blocked a Congressman from appearing as a guest on his program because of the Congressman’s race.”"
women,"Fox associate producer John Fawcett, 27, alleged in the suit that Napolitano had “sexually harassed numerous young male employees during his tenure at Fox News.” Fawcett claimed that in 2019, Napolitano stood “awkwardly close” to him in an elevator at Fox News headquarters and began stroking his arm. Fawcett also claimed that Napolitano told him he could visit his horse farm and get hands “really dirty.”"
women,"Fox has been rocked by multiple accusations of sexual harassment and lawsuits over the years. The late Fox News chairman Roger Ailes was forced out after several accusations of sexual harassment as was network co-president Bill Shine and Fox News personality Bill O’Reilly, among others."
women,Fox News said that the additional allegations were “completely baseless and nothing more than a desperate attempt at a payday by trying the case in the court of public opinion.”
women,"Donald Trump Jr.’s girlfriend, Kimberley Guilfoyle, left Fox in 2018 after a female assistant accused her of repeated sexual harassment and demanded damages. The complaints resulted in a multi-million dollar out-of-court settlement."
women,"“We take all allegations of misconduct seriously, are committed to providing a safe, transparent, and collaborative workplace environment for all our employees and took immediate, appropriate action,” Fox News stated."
women,Neither Kudlow nor Napolitano — whose time on the network dwindled after harsh attacks on former President Donald Trump — could be reached for comment.
women,Angelina Melnikova of the team representing the Russian Olympic Committee and Mai Murakami of Japan tied for bronze with a score of 14.166. The gymnasts had both the same difficulty score and execution score in their routines.

women,The 21-year-old from Arizona bounced back from a frightening stumble during the vault final on Sunday to claim the top spot on floor with a score of 14.366. The medal is the fifth claimed by the U.S. women’s gymnastics team in Tokyo even with star Simone Biles sitting out four finals to focus on her mental health.
women,American gymnast Jade Carey won the gold medal on floor exercise at the Tokyo Olympics on Monday.
women,"Italian Vanessa Ferrari, fourth at both the 2008 and 2016 Olympics, claimed silver. The 30-year-old’s dramatic performance drew a roar from the various federations inside the Ariake Gymnastics Centre."
women,Here’s her mighty heave that inspired her to party ...
women,"But the twerk was the “chef’s kiss,” according to viewers."
women,Sha’Carri Richardson left conjecture over how she would have done in the Olympic 100-meter final to others on Twitter.
women,"“Congratulations to the ladies of Jamaica for the clean sweep,” Richardson wrote. “Powerful, strong black women dominating the sport.”"
women,"Saunders saved her most meaningful gesture for last, though. After receiving her medal on the podium Sunday, she defied restrictions on athlete protests by crossing her arms in an “X,” which she said represented “the intersection of where all people who are oppressed meet.”"
women,"The American track star, left off the Olympic team for using marijuana, had only positive vibes on Saturday to send to Jamaica’s Elaine Thompson-Herah, Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and Shericka Jackson for their gold, silver and bronze-winning performance in Tokyo."
women,"Thompson-Herah broke the Olympic record in a time of 10.61 seconds, which certainly would have been a difficult challenge for Richardson, who has a career best of 10.72 seconds, in addition to a wind-aided 10.64. She won the 100-meter at the U.S. trials but was stripped of her title and kept off the team after testing positive for marijuana."
women,"
U.S. gymnast MyKayla Skinner was a mere spectator at the Tokyo Olympics days ago, believing her Olympic dreams were done after she failed to qualify for an individual event.
But on Sunday she became an improbable silver medal winner in the vault as a replacement for Simone Biles.
Here’s one of Skinner’s vaults that helped propel her to a 14.916 score. She was second to Brazil’s Rebeca Andrade (15.083), who won gold after getting a silver behind American Sunisa Lee in the all-around:
"
women,"On Friday, Richardson noted her absence from the games, tweeting “Missing me yet?”"
women,American Jade Carey struggled with an average of 12.416.
women,South Korea’s Yeo Seojeong (14.733) won bronze.
women,"Skinner, who was an alternate on the 2016 Olympic team, learned Saturday that she would replace Simone Biles in the vault for the apparatus finals, and she dedicated her one last chance to the four-time gold medalist. Biles dropped out of the team, all-around and some individual events, including the vault, while wrestling with mental health concerns and disorientation on her acrobatics. “Doing this for us @simonebiles,” Skinner, 24, wrote on Instagram."
women,And now she’s doing a happy dance as a silver medalist.
women,"U.S. gymnast Simone Biles will compete in the balance beam final at the Tokyo Olympics, USA Gymnastics announced Monday."
women,"Biles, who dropped out of the team competition, all-around final and the other three individual events amid mental health concerns and bouts of disorientation while performing, will be joined Tuesday by teammate and all-around gold medalist successor Sunisa Lee."
women,"Lee’s entry into the event was previously assumed, but Biles’ participation had been uncertain."
women,"The U.S. grabbed silver in the team final after Biles left the competition following an awkward vault. Lee captured gold in the all-around. And on Sunday, MyKayla Skinner, who replaced Biles in the individual vault, won a surprising silver. Lee took bronze in the uneven bars."
women,Skinner had hinted that Biles would possibly return for one final event.
women,The two-time Emmy-winning star of “My Life On The D-List” shared her health news in a social media statement that said she will soon undergo surgery.
women,Comedian Kathy Griffin revealed Monday she’s battling early-stage lung cancer.
women,"“I’ve got to tell you guys something. I have cancer. I’m about to go into surgery to have half of my left lung removed,” Griffin, 60, wrote. “Yes, I have lung cancer even though I’ve never smoked!”"
women,"“The doctors are very optimistic as it is stage one and contained to my left lung,” she continued, saying she hopes to avoid additional treatments like chemotherapy or radiation."
women,"“I should have normal function with my breathing. I should be up and running around as usual in a month or less,” she wrote."
women,"“It’s been a helluva 4 years, trying to get back to work, making you guys laugh and entertaining you,” Griffin continued in a reference to how she’s been blacklisted in Hollywood since posting the now-infamous photo of her holding a severed head resembling then-President Donald Trump. “But I’m gonna be just fine.” "
women,Griffin ended her message by assuring fans she intends to be cracking jokes again in no time.
women,"Griffin added that she is vaccinated against COVID-19. “The consequences for being unvaccinated would have been even more serious,” she said. “Please stay up to date on your medical check ups. It’ll save your life.”"
women,"Griffin was hospitalized last year after believing she was experiencing “unbearably painful” COVID-19 symptoms, only to discover that she was suffering from an abdominal infection. "
women,"“As a friend of mine had said, ”‘How many kicks in the nuts can you take?’ Griffin joked about her life upheavals as of late. “And I’m like my nuts are pretty strong, but it’s a challenge.’” "
women,"Griffin’s mother, Maggie Griffin, who appeared alongside her daughter for years on the beloved Bravo reality series, died last year at age 99 after struggling with dementia."
women,"In addition to her cancer journey, the comedian will address “her mental health struggles over the last few years, her addiction to pills, a suicide attempt, her newfound sobriety and more” in the interview, according to ABC. "
women,"In a clip from a “Nightline” interview with co-anchor Juju Chang set to air on Monday, Griffin revealed she only received her cancer diagnosis a few weeks ago. "
women,"“I was definitely in shock,” she continued in the interview. “I’m still a little bit in shock, not denial, but once a day I’ll turn to somebody and be like, ‘Can you believe this shit? Is this a bitch or what?’” "
women,"No gold or even silver for you, U.S. women’s national soccer team."
women,"The world’s top-ranked squad lost Monday to No. 8 Canada, 1-0, in a Tokyo Olympics semifinal that left the Americans far short of expectations."
women,"After a foul by Tierna Davidson of the U.S., Jessie Fleming of Canada scored the match’s lone goal in the 75th minute on a penalty kick that got past goalkeeper Adrianna Franch, who subbed in for an injured Alyssa Naeher during the first half."
women,"In one of the Americans’ last gasps, Carli Loyd headed a ball against the bar in the 86th minute."
women,Lloyd was part of a wave of veteran substitutions late in the 60th minute that also included Megan Rapinoe and Christen Press. But to no avail.
women,"The last time the two teams played each other in the Olympics was in a London 2012 semifinal, when the U.S. won in a 4-3 nail-biter. The American team would go on to capture the gold, its last in the Summer Games and the last time it medaled. It got booted by Sweden in the Rio 2016 quarterfinals."
women,This squad was attempting to become the first team to secure an Olympic gold as the defending World Cup champs.
women,"Canada was expected by some to be an easier mark than the fourth-ranked Dutch, who were dispatched by the Americans on penalty kicks in the Tokyo Olympics quarterfinal."
women,The U.S. still has a chance for bronze against Australia in a Thursday match. The two teams played to a scoreless tie in the group stage.
women,DaBaby’s attempt to dismiss Questlove quickly backfired. 
women,"The legendary drummer for The Roots publicly condemned DaBaby for the rapper’s recent homophobic, sexist and derogatory remarks at the Rolling Loud festival in Miami last weekend. Questlove called the comments “morally wrong” in a lengthy Instagram post Thursday."
women,"DaBaby initially doubled down on his comments, calling his remarks “a call to action” in an Instagram Live on Monday. He then issued an apology on Twitter Tuesday: “Anybody who done ever been effected by AIDS/HIV y’all got the right to be upset, what I said was insensitive even though I have no intentions on offending anybody. So my apologies. But the LGBT community... I ain’t trippin on y’all, do you. y’all business is y’all business.”"
women,"DaBaby responded Thursday evening, claiming in posts on his Instagram stories that he didn’t know who Questlove was, Billboard reported."
women,"“I ain’t even tryna be funny when i say .... i do NOT KNOW WHO DIS N**** IS DAWG,” one post read."
women,"DaBaby faced widespread backlash after he made a series of derogatory statements onstage about women, gay men and those living with HIV."
women,He later added that he did not care about losing Questlove as a fan and suggested that the hip-hop icon was being a follower.
women,"The rapper spread misinformation about HIV and AIDS, telling the crowd to hold up their phones “if you didn’t show up today with HIV/AIDS, or other STDs that’ll make you die in two to three weeks,” according to video captured by TMZ."
women,"Twitter users were quick to point out that perhaps a rapper should not boast about not knowing Questlove or The Roots, whose influence in hip-hop began over three decades ago. DaBaby released his debut studio album, “Baby on Baby,” in 2019."
women,"Questlove was joined by other celebrities who condemned DaBaby’s remarks this past week, including Madonna, Elton John andDua Lipa. "
women,"And she had a message for the four-time gold medalist, who dropped out of the team and all-round events ― and then two individual events ― amid mental health concerns and a case of the “twisties.”"
women,And now she’s got one more chance.
women,"The U.S. gymnast, who didn’t advance in any individual event at the Tokyo Olympics, learned Saturday that she would replace Simone Biles in the vault during the apparatus finals."
women,"“Looks like I get to put a competition Leo on just one more time. Can’t wait to compete in vault finals,” Skinner, 24, wrote on Instagram. “Doing this for us @simonebiles.”"
women,"Go crush that vault, MyKayla!"
women,"
Just days ago, Skinner sat with Biles in the stands to watch teammate Sunisa Lee take gold in the all-round. Skinner thought her Olympics were over.
"
women,"The Republican candidate — a venture capitalist and author of “Hillbilly Elegy” — attacked Democrats who don’t have children because, he claimed, “they don’t have a stake” in the system, he explained to Carlson on Thursday night. Vance, 36, who has been married seven years, has two children."
women,MyKayla Skinner is back and more grateful than ever.
women,"Skinner recorded the fourth-highest score on the vault during qualifying. She is joined by American Jade Carey, who had the second-highest score."
women,"Controversial right-wing Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance bashed Democrats as miserable “childless cat ladies” who don’t serve a “healthy ruling class,” he told Tucker Carlson on Fox News."
women,"“If we want a healthy ruling class in this country, we should invest more, we should vote more, we should support more people who actually have kids,” Vance told Carlson."
women,"Vance’s comment may have been a slip of the tongue (he didn’t correct himself), but Ocasio-Cortez was convinced the candidate said exactly what he actually meant."
women,"More on that in a bit. First, enjoy her victory over Australian rival Ariarne Titmus to bring her Tokyo gold medal count to two and career tally to seven. She has 10 medals overall."
women,"Lots of others piled on Vance, including those who pointed out how little Vance’s Republican Party does to financially support children in struggling families or to fight for services like health care for families."
women,Ledecky is planning on future Olympic success as well.
women,"He singled out Vice President Kamala Harris (who has two stepchildren), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg."
women,"Both Ocasio-Cortez, 31, and Buttigieg, 39, rather famously have dogs, not cats, and Buttigieg isn’t a lady. Buttigieg’s husband, Chasten Buttigieg, on Monday slammed Vance’s earlier comments attacking the “childless left” for being heartless and pointed out that the men are currently seeking to adopt a child."
women,"She clapped back in a tweet Friday: “When you accidentally let your billionaire funder-talk slip out on TV, you say things like ‘a healthy ruling class.’”"
women,"It’s unknown what Ocasio-Cortez’s family plans are — or if that’s anybody’s business or has any effect on her political commitment. Vance could be right, though, that the Democrats he named have no interest in serving the “ruling class.” "
women,Katie Ledecky won the 800-meter freestyle at her third straight Olympics on Saturday but offered perhaps even better news for U.S. swim fans: She isn’t done burning up the pool at future Olympics if she can help it.
women,"The Jamaican sprinter had plenty to yell about. She won the gold medal in the women’s 100 meters in an Olympic record time of 10.61 seconds, defending her 2016 Rio victory and completing a Jamaican sweep."
women,"It was one of the fastest fields ever ― one that might have been even faster if American Sha’Carri Richardson had made the trip to Tokyo. Richardson had emerged as the best U.S. sprint hope, but lost her spot on the team when she tested positive for marijuana."
women,"As it was, the lone American to make the final, Teahna Daniels, finished seventh in a time of 11.02."
women,"Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who was attempting to become the first woman to win the premier track event three times, finished second in 10.74 seconds, and countrywoman Shericka Jackson was third in 10.76."
women,"Paris will be the site of the 2024 Games, and Los Angeles in ’28."
women,"“That was not my last swim,” she told NBC. “I’m at least going to ’24, maybe ’28. We’ll see.”"
women,"Ledecky, 24, still made sure to savor her victory on Saturday in what was her final Tokyo event. “You never take anything for granted,” she said. “You don’t know if you’re going to be back at the next Olympics, so just try to soak it all in.”"
women,Elaine Thompson-Herah’s shrieks of joy could be heard throughout the nearly empty Olympic Stadium on Saturday night.
women,"Some fans insisted she would have won the race Saturday if she were there. Elaine Thompson-Herah won in an Olympic-record 10.61 seconds. Second place finisher Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce clocked 10.74. Richardson’s best official time is 10.72 (in addition to a wind-aided 10.64 at the trials), but she is considered an ascendant young champion."
women,"“Carri would’ve dusted yall,” one user wrote."
women,Sha’Carri Richardson was the U.S. trials champion and by far the Americans’ best sprint hope until she was stripped of her title and kept off the Olympic team for using marijuana.
women,Some of the best trash-talking about the women’s 100-meter final at the Tokyo Olympics didn’t even involve a sprinter who was there.
women,"The AIU informed Okagbare of her suspension on Saturday morning, it said, ruling her out of the 100 and likely ending her Olympics. Under doping regulations, she is allowed to request that a “B” sample — or backup sample — is tested to double-check the results."
women,Okagbare’s suspension came three days after the AIU announced that 10 track and field athletes from Nigeria were among a group of 20 from various countries who were disqualified from competing at the Olympics because they hadn’t met minimum doping test requirements. The AIU didn’t name any of those athletes.
women,"Okagbare tested positive for human growth hormone in an out-of-competition test on July 19, four days before the Olympics opened, the Athletics Integrity Unit said, prompting a mandatory provisional suspension."
women,Now there’s an argument starter.
women,"The 32-year-old Okagbare won a silver medal in the long jump at the 2008 Beijing Olympics and at the 2013 world championships. She also collected a bronze in the 200 meters at the 2013 worlds in Moscow behind gold medal winner Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, who is the favorite for the 100 title in Tokyo. Okagbare did the 100-200 double at the 2014 Commonwealth Games."
women,"The results of that test were only received by track and field’s anti-doping body late Friday and after Okagbare had already run in the 100 heats on the opening day of track competition at the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo, the AIU said."
women,"Nigerian sprinter Blessing Okagbare was provisionally suspended for doping Saturday, hours before the former world championships silver medalist was due to run in the semifinals of the women’s 100 meters at the Olympics."
women,She won her heat in 11.05 seconds and was due to run in the semifinals on Saturday. The highly-anticipated women’s 100 final is the last event on the day’s track schedule.
women,Jennifer Hudson delivers an awe-inspiring performance singing “Respect” in the first official clip for the upcoming Aretha Franklin biopic.
women,"Hudson, who was hand-picked by Franklin to play her, has often said publicly that it was always her dream to portray the cultural icon. "
women,"The video, which was released on Friday, shows the actor/singer performing the beloved song onstage as the late Queen of Soul. The movie, which is also titled “Respect,” is set to hit theaters on Aug. 13."
women,"“I just hope I make her proud [and] do her justice,” Hudson said at the time. "
women,"In an interview with People in 2019, she said she had “huge shoes to fill.”"
women,Franklin died in August 2018 at age 76.
women,"Other cast members in “Respect,” which is directed by Liesl Tommy, include Forest Whitaker, Marlon Wayans, Marc Maron, Tituss Burgess and Mary J. Blige."
women,"“Every day, everyone showed up and gave their all with nothing but RESPECT for Ms. Franklin,” she added. "
women,Hudson posted a photo on Instagram on Friday of the cast and crew behind the biopic. She said in the caption that every department involved with the film “put their heart and soul into this production.”
women,"While it was his foot-long penis that many people desired, it was this guy’s face, handsomely round like a grown-up cherub, that drew me to him nearly 20 years ago."
women,"When my husband and I went to Iceland, the first place we visited was a penis museum. I was okay with seeing preserved phalluses of whales, polar bears and reindeer, but it was hard to get past people shrieking in disgust or snapping selfies while pretending to lick the exhibits. Worse yet were the guys who boasted things like, “That moose has nothing on me.” I sighed, wondering if men would ever stop obsessing over the inches in our pants. "
women,I was stunned. Who goes to a penis museum in Iceland with his husband and finds a picture of a man he’d slept with?
women,"Unlike the other patrons, my husband quietly observed each display with his hands neatly folded behind his back. I moved past the animals in favor of photos of naked men on the wall. To my surprise, I recognized one of the models. "
women,"“Don’t worry, we’ll just go slow,” he said, to my relief. Yet I remained nervous and felt like I wasn’t pleasing him. We mostly kissed and fondled — stuff I could handle. He remained a gentleman throughout. After we were done, I hurried to get dressed and leave."
women,"We’d met in a gay chatroom. It was in the days before instant hookup apps like Grindr and Scruff, and looking for action with a dial-up modem was a much slower burn that could take all night. And nothing soured my libido like a spotty internet connection. After an hour, I received a private message. The conversation basically went like, “Hi, you’re cute. Let’s hook up. Oh, and I’m really well endowed.”"
women,"I lingered by his photo, reminiscing on the joys and the mistakes of my younger days. I wouldn’t call it regrets, but I began the slippery slope of imagining my life with this man who was not my husband. I never wanted to cheat on him, but having these thoughts ― and feeling inexplicably giddy to see that cherub face again ― sure made me feel like I’d broken my word. I trembled with uncertainty. Was I carrying unresolved feelings? Was I unhappy in my marriage and didn’t realize it?"
women,"“Let’s go to a movie sometime,” he suggested. I was surprised he wanted to see me again and excited because I’d never gone on a date with a guy. I imagined us holding hands while watching “Brokeback Mountain” and fantasized about all the other outings that would follow. I called and sent a few emails, but we never saw each other again."
women,"“I’d like to come over and show you in person,” he announced."
women,"When I met my husband on OkCupid, I was 36 and still hadn’t found love. "
women,"My 90-minute trek, via a bus and two trains, didn’t quash my nerves. I shook, but he was inviting, friendly and sweet. We talked for a bit before undressing. I rambled about my job writing marketing copy for an accounting firm and bored even myself. He enjoyed the notoriety that came with being so well hung, but really wanted to be an actor. Like a serious actor, not porn, to be clear. I made a bad joke about wanting him to be my first taste of celebrity. He took off his pants, and I stared. A lot. I couldn’t help myself. As I was just over 5 feet tall, his penis was like one-fifth the size of my entire body. I had no idea what to do with something so big."
women,"I wasn’t a size queen, but I was curious to see his record-breaking rod."
women,"“Sounds nice,” I replied, wishing I could be more provocative. At 22, I was shy and not very experienced, so my flirty was far from sexy."
women,"“How soon?” I asked, forgetting that my conservative Catholic parents were in the other room. Thankfully, he offered his place."
women,"I was grateful to now have a special someone. Yet we moved fast — living together in less than a year and getting married shortly after — that I often second-guessed my every move. Feeling stressed, I wondered if I should clue my husband into my thoughts. I didn’t like bringing up my past, but my sex life had never stared me in the face like this in all of its glory."
women,“What was your longest relationship?” he asked on our first date.
women,"“If I went to bed with a guy and he stayed for breakfast,” I responded. Sadly, that didn’t even occur very often. "
women,"My attention turned back to the photo. I thought about what would happen if I contacted the guy again. But what would I even say? “Hey, it’s been 20 years, but I saw your photo in an Icelandic Phallic Museum. Want to get coffee?”"
women,"I accepted his request but denied myself the opportunity to message him. I realized that being with my husband taught me that the human heart is the most important organ of all. And in terms of size, my love for him could house a museum all of its own."
women,"Then, I looked across the room at my husband smiling so inquisitively as he flipped through a book on the anatomy of trolls. It was the same look he had when I fell in love with him. We were on a roller coaster and I screamed my head off while he focused on figuring out the physics. Thinking of this memory, and many others, I snapped out of my paranoia. I loved him, our marriage was fine, everyone has a past, now let’s get out of this museum before I have a nervous breakdown."
women,Lady Gaga’s long-awaited return to the big screen looks nothing short of dazzling. 
women,"Fans got their first look at Ridley Scott’s “House of Gucci” late Thursday, when the first trailer was released. Due out this fall, the crime drama follows Patrizia Reggiani (played by Gaga), who was convicted of plotting the 1995 murder of her ex-husband, fashion impresario Maurizio Gucci (Adam Driver). An Italian socialite, Reggiani served 18 years before she was released from prison in 2016."
women,"As we toured the rest of Iceland, spotting rainbows and waterfalls and even those ever-elusive auroras, all felt right, dare I say perfect. Until I made the mistake of checking my email, only to find a LinkedIn request from ― who else ― the man with the hall-of-fame phallus. He still had the same cherub face. But what in the name of Bjork was the universe now trying to tell me?"
women,"Early buzz for “House of Gucci,” which also stars Al Pacino and Jared Leto, began building in March when Gaga shared a wintry photo with Driver on location in the Italian Alps. "
women,"On Thursday, Gaga and her co-stars sent the hype machine into overdrive yet again by unveiling a series of character posters that included a nearly unrecognizable Leto as Paolo Gucci."
women,"The movie is adapted from Sara Gay Forden’s book, “The House of Gucci: A Sensational Story of Murder, Madness, Glamour, and Greed.” "
women,"“It was a name that sounded so sweet, so seductive. Synonymous with wealth, style, power,” a heavily accented Gaga proclaims in the trailer, as Blondie’s “Heart of Glass” plays. “But that name was a curse, too.” "
women,"Mark Jason Williams is an award-winning playwright who writes essays and travel stories for The Washington Post, Thrillist, and Out Magazine. He is currently working on an essay collection."
women,“Why?” something wailed inside me. “What went wrong? You’re just getting started!”
women,"“Mama, I don’t think I want to do art anymore.”"
women,“House of Gucci” hits theaters Nov. 24. 
women,"Everything had been going right. She had debuted her solo exhibition at Google, showcased her work in three countries, won award after award, held memberships in two professional artist organizations. She serves as an art ambassador to the Amazon Aid Foundation and Tomorrow’s Air﻿. The Cartoon Network included her in its celebration of Hispanic Heritage month last September. Telemundo came to our house to film an extended interview. NBC’s California Live did a piece; ABC 7 News aired a spot about her 6-foot sea lion statue at Pier 39 in San Francisco. More requests were coming in — but Aria Luna had had enough. She was done."
women,"My entire world came crashing down with those words. My daughter, barely 10 years old and already one of the world’s youngest professional artists, just pulled the plug on an entire career that was supposed to be hers."
women,Members of the Gucci family have publicly denounced the film. 
women,"“They are stealing the identity of a family to make a profit, to increase the income of the Hollywood system,” Patrizia Gucci, Maurizio’s second cousin, told The Associated Press in April. “Our family has an identity, privacy. We can talk about everything, but there is a borderline that cannot be crossed.”"
women,"I remember the day Aria Luna came to me with her very first drawing ― two octopuses drawn in dark blue marker. I was as touched as any mama would be with her child’s first drawing but had no idea how far Aria’s talent would go. Just a year or so later, she drew a girl’s face with full, rich lips, textured and shaded with multiple colors of red and brown. She was 3."
women,"Four years after that, Google hosted Aria’s first solo exhibition, a series of large-format mixed-media paintings telling the story of Bogo Mogo, the plastic monster, and the Guardians of the Sea battling him and protecting the ocean from plastic pollution. From there, things moved fast — more events, arts festivals, even a gallery exhibition were planned — and then COVID-19 shut them all down. "
women,"Still, there’s no doubt “House of Gucci” will reaffirm Gaga’s status as a triple threat. The film is her first foray into acting since 2018’s “A Star Is Born,” which nabbed her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress and a win for Best Song. "
women,"With art, it’s not about the perfection of skills as much as that subjective, intuitive, almost subconscious connection. Aria Luna’s art has that connection, that expressiveness, that emotion that just clicks. You can’t rationalize or explain it, but you can feel it. It feels like a special type of magic."
women,"Undeterred, we pressed on, taking Aria Luna’s show on the virtual road. She did more events and appearances in 2020 than in the previous year, all of them online. Her paintings even traveled on their own, maskless, to France for an exhibition."
women,"But the isolation of attending school remotely, being cut off from friends and extended family took its toll. Unlike all those artists who found a higher mojo in lockdown, Aria Luna’s inspiration withered. She missed her friends and classmates most of all. The mix of social isolation and a demanding school and work schedule pushed her off her balance beam. She stopped painting for several months."
women,"An artist is not a gymnast, and yet, in one profound way, the two are no different from each other than a musician is from a soccer player, or a chess master is from a swimmer. All fields that enable mastery require intense focus, dedication and that special spark ― that exceptional natural ability we call talent. You’ve probably heard any number of variations on the talent versus hard work theme... my favorite is Tim Notke’s “Hard work beats talent when talent doesn’t work hard.” That’s what I was trying to teach my daughter. Talent is a gift and a blessing; the work you put in to honor that talent gives you your reward."
women,"That moment on Tuesday, when I read that first headline announcing Simone Biles was stepping off the Olympic stage, scream-pulled me back to that day earlier this year when Aria Luna said no more. In that silence that stretched itself fierce and long between her declaration and my response, I saw two roads roll out in front of me."
women,"An artist is not a gymnast. Even if you have natural talent for gymnastics, it still takes years and years of training and practice to get to the level of an Aly Raisman, Jordan Chiles or the GOAT herself, Simone Biles. If you have a natural talent for art, you don’t have to master a Yurchenko double brushstroke in order to be recognized. But your artistic “performance,” captured on canvas, paper or an electronic screen, does have to touch and inspire people’s hearts and minds — and that can be the result of five minutes, five months or five years of work."
women,"It struck me how differently children see the world. How much more simple, direct and brutally honest their perception is. As a grown adult author, I knew the media landscape well. I was a journalist early on in my career; I have also been on the other side of the mic, interviewed about my books and my work. I love public speaking, leading workshops, connecting with audiences. I had no issue with responding to the same questions over and over again because that’s how you get your voice heard. How can I help my daughter enjoy talking to the media, who are so clearly enamored with her talent?"
women,"I chose to listen. Aria said she didn’t want to do more media interviews because “they’re always the same questions, and I have to say the same things over and over again,” she said, frustrated. “There are too many deadlines. It feels like too much pressure. I don’t just want to do art. I want to explore other things, too, like math, physics. Maybe I’ll invent something to help people.”"
women,"One roared: “Seize your power as the parent, the guiding force, the coach, the mentor! Don’t let your daughter tumble into the abyss of self-doubt! She is too young to know what she needs for success.”"
women,Wrong question.
women,"This is why Simone’s decision to step off the mat rang so deeply and powerfully for me this week. Simone is an adult now. She is much more able to advocate for herself, make the calls that are best for her and have the wisdom and courage to withstand the intense public pressures to stand by her decision. It’s an extraordinary level of maturity to see in someone just 24 years old. This is a large part of what makes her the GOAT, the greatest of all time."
women,The other spoke more softly: “Listen. Hear what she has to say.”
women,"When I heard my daughter say, “I don’t just want to do art,” my ego interpreted it as the end of her artistic career. But when I listened, her message was much louder, clearer and broader than I could have dared imagine. In addition to art, she also happens to have an outstanding musical ear, she sings, has taught herself piano, excels in math and has taken it upon herself to learn Japanese. For me to insist she focus exclusively on her visual art would be madness. Who am I to imagine what her life should be? Let her wow the world with all of her talents the way she wants to, on her time. "
women,And we wonder why the chef sometimes needs a break and walks out of that hot kitchen.
women,"The scale of Simone’s achievements is far more global and legend-breaking than Aria Luna’s string of pearls, as I call her accomplishments, but it’s not the scale that matters. It’s the volatile dynamic of talent versus pressure, fulfillment versus expectation. NBC host Mike Tirico said it best in a recent newscast: “The hardest thing to do in sports… is win when you are supposed to win, and everybody says you’re supposed to win.” I can’t think of any competitive or creative profession this statement doesn’t apply to."
women,"Looking back on Aria Luna’s media interviews, I could see that there was some of that. I had thought at the time it’s because some of the interviews were in Spanish, which she’s still learning. But now I saw what I was too busy to see before: She was feeling overwhelmed. When she finally said, “Mama, no more,” that discomfort had already bubbled over. And I saw that the only thing I could do, if I truly loved and believed in her, was to honor that wish and give her the space she needed. Because that magic she has, that mind-boggling ability to whip up a painting or drawing without planning, sketching or any sort of preparation, in a matter of minutes, cannot be forced. It cannot be scheduled, planned or outlined. It needs space — her head and heart-space, which is hers and hers alone. It’s a sacred space only Aria Luna inhabits, just as Simone Biles alone inhabits her sacred space."
women,"Those of us enjoying the fruits of our athletes, artists, musicians, scientists and other thinkers, creators and innovators experience their talents the easy way. We’re not in the gym or the pool eight hours a day. We’re not in the studio working our fingers to the bone. We’re not twisting our neurons into impossible knots trying to crack the code of a new technology. We get the cake when it’s baked. "
women,"It’s heartwarming to see the level of support and love pouring forth from the international community for Simone, from her coaches and fellow athletes, celebrities, other public figures and her fans because it means we as a society are starting to understand. We’re starting to see just how intense the pressures on our super-creators really are and what we can collectively do to give back some of that love that they’ve been pouring out for us with all of their energy, talent and hard work."
women,"For one thing, we can dial down the pressure to win gold, to be the highest-ranked at all times, to have the most money, the most followers, the most expensive cars, the biggest houses. We can enjoy the talents of our creators for what they are and how they inspire us, not for their medals or titles. But the easiest and most important thing we can do, especially as the parents and coaches of the younger generations now coming up on the heels of the Simones and the Naomis, is listen. When I quieted my own mind and listened to Aria Luna, I realized that my challenge and purpose are not just to support my daughter and her talent. My challenge is to learn and evolve along with her. My purpose is to fly with her, without forcing her wings."
women,"Birgitte Rasine is a literary author, publisher and a former journalist for the Hollywood trades. Her first novel is “The Jaguar and the Cacao Tree” (because she’s a hopeless chocoholic). You can follow her on Twitter at @birgitte_rasine and Aria Luna on Instagram at @aria.luna.art."
women,“And in case you’re wondering… Aria Luna is painting again.”
women,"“She can do whatever she wants,” she said. “Whatever people say doesn’t matter. It’s her life.”"
women,"I asked Aria Luna what she thought of Simone leaving the Olympic competition. She looked at me, shocked at first at what had happened. Then she shrugged her shoulder. "
women,"Matt Damon is earning critical praise for his performance in “Stillwater,” but not everyone is a fan of the new movie. "
women,"“Stillwater,” which premiered at the 2021 Cannes Film Festival earlier this month, follows Bill Baker (played by Damon), an Oklahoma oil worker who relocates to Marseille, France, after his daughter, Allison (Abigail Breslin), is wrongfully charged with murdering a friend. "
women,"Knox, 34, was particularly critical of a Vanity Fair article published Thursday in which McCarthy said he’d used her controversial case as the basis for the “Stillwater” script ― which he co-wrote with Thomas Bidegain, Noé Debré and Marcus Hinchey ― before deciding to “fictionalize everything around it.” "
women,"The film, she wrote, profits off “my name, face, and story without my consent” and “at the expense of my reputation.” "
women,"Amanda Knox, who was convicted and then exonerated in the 2007 murder of fellow exchange student Meredith Kercher, took aim at Damon and “Stillwater” director Tom McCarthy in a lengthy Twitter thread that was also published as a blog on her website. "
women,"Knox spent four years imprisoned for the 2007 killing of Kercher, her roommate, in Perugia, Italy, where both women were studying abroad. She was fully exonerated in 2015 and now works as a journalist and podcast host. "
women,"And like those earlier projects, “Stillwater” shifts “attention away from the memory of Meredith Kercher” and reinforces “the tabloid conspiracy [guilty] version of me,” Knox wrote. "
women,"For someone who is also deeply gifted in their field but just 10 years old, that level of maturity and wisdom cannot be realistically expected. It is on us, the parents, teachers, coaches, guardians, to recognize the difference between our own ambitions for our children and what is best for their development, evolution, and success and personal happiness. To know them enough to respect them in their full and wondrous and unique individuality. To see the dangers lurking in too much success, too much fame, too fast. And to know when to step aside or redirect the professional path of the emerging star so they can continue to shine for the long term."
women,"When Naomi Osaka withdrew from the French Open, citing her own mental health, one line in the news articles stuck to me like thistle flowers: She didn’t want to talk to the media because she would experience “huge waves of anxiety.”"
women,"In retribution, she jokingly offered to write a screenplay based on Damon’s life that, according to her, would take similar liberties with his story. "
women,"“I bet we could have a fascinating conversation about identity, and public perception, and who should get to exploit a name, face, and story that has entered the public imagination,” she said. "
women,"Of course, “Stillwater” is not the first Hollywood property to draw from the case. In 2011, Lifetime released “Amanda Knox: Murder on Trial in Italy” starring Hayden Panettiere as Knox. In 2019, executive producer Danny Strong acknowledged that Fox’s “Proven Innocent” was “a very fictionalized version” of Knox’s story. The series was canceled after one season. "
women,"Originally slated for a 2020 release, the movie hit theaters Friday after being delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. "
women,"Elsewhere in the thread, she invited McCarthy and Damon to appear on her podcast, “Labyrinths,” so that she could better relay her views. "
women,"“There were so many characters around the case that I really followed pretty closely,” he said. “But really the first thing that I took away from it was, what would that be like as an American student to go over [to Europe] for what should be one of the most exciting moments in a young-adult life and to find yourself in that tragedy? There were just so many layers to that story that kept anyone who was following pretty riveted.” "
women,"In his interview with Vanity Fair, McCarthy said he was “fascinated” by Knox’s story, noting that he and his co-writers also drew from true crime podcasts like “Serial” when working on the “Stillwater” screenplay. "
women,Fans eager to catch a performance of “Wicked” and “Hamilton” when Broadway reopens later this year will have to get their COVID-19 vaccine and wear a mask in order to do so. 
women,"The long-awaited (and previously postponed) 2020 Tokyo Olympics have begun. While the Games have been marred with COVID-19-related controversy and athletes are competing without fans present to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, top athletes from around the world have descended upon Tokyo to compete for the chance at a medal. Below are some moments from the first week of competition in Tokyo, Japan."
women,"The Broadway League on Friday announced that all 41 of the Great White Way’s theaters will require all audience members, performers, backstage crew and staff to be fully vaccinated. In addition, all patrons will be required to wear a mask for the duration of the performance."
women,"In June, Bruce Springsteen performed Broadway’s first full-capacity show since the start of the pandemic, reprising his 2019 residency-style concert, “Springsteen on Broadway.”"
women,"Exceptions will be made for children under age 12, who are not yet eligible for the vaccine, and those with medical conditions or religious beliefs that prevent vaccination. Those guests will be required to provide proof of a negative COVID-19 PCR test taken within 72 hours of the performance start time, or a negative COVID-19 antigen test taken within six hours of the curtain rising."
women,"Broadway theaters abruptly closed March 12, 2020 after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. The ongoing shutdown has led to an estimated loss of $35 million per week. "

women,"“Pass Over,” the first new play of the 2021 season, is scheduled to begin preview performances on Aug. 4. "
women,"“A uniform policy across all New York City Broadway theaters makes it simple for our audiences and should give even more confidence to our guests about how seriously Broadway is taking audience safety,” she added."
women,"At present, the policies will remain in effect through Oct. 31. According to the Broadway League, they will then be reviewed and either extended or relaxed, depending on coronavirus conditions. "

women,"The four-time gold medalist on Friday shared video proof of her continued bout with the so-called twisties, in which gymnasts can get lost in the air during acrobatic maneuvers."
women,"In a clip of her practicing a twisting dismount on the uneven parallel bars, Biles lands flat on her back."
women,"She noted to fans on her Instagram story that, thankfully, the mat was cushy."

women,Biles told fans that her “mind and body are simply not in sync” and that the problem emerged randomly after the qualifying round.

She aborted a more difficult move after getting confused in the air, and shot back at trolls who say she quit."
women,"They seek to add statues of O’Connor and Ginsburg, the first and second women on the Supreme Court. Ginsburg was an international feminist icon and was still serving as a justice when she died last year."

women,"“Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sandra Day O’Connor were trailblazers long before reaching the Supreme Court, opening doors for women at a time when so many insisted on keeping them shut,” Klobuchar said in a statement."
women,"“The Capitol is our most recognizable symbol of Democracy, a place where people from across our country have their voices represented and heard. It is only fitting that we honor their remarkable lives and service to our country by establishing statues in the Capitol.”"
women,Other lawmakers offered similar sentiments and highlighted the women’s efforts in breaking barriers and paving the way for other women as champions of equality and as inspiration for women and girls everywhere.

women,"Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) is set to introduce bold legislation on Friday that would create a guaranteed income program in the U.S. to send $1,200 a month directly to most Americans. "
women,"“Their presence in our Capitol is a reminder that a woman’s place is everywhere,” the group said."
women,"The national guaranteed income program would start in 2028, sending $1,200 per month to adults making up to $75,000 per year, or heads of household making up to $112,500 per year, as well as providing $600 monthly per child. The payments would phase out for higher incomes."
women,"The SUPPORT Act — co-sponsored by progressive lawmakers Reps. Cori Bush (D-Mo.), Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), Dwight Evans (D-Penn.) and Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) — would first create a $2.5 billion grant program to fund local pilots in guaranteed income. These would run in hundreds of communities across the country from 2023 to 2027 and provide findings for a national program."
women,"Importantly, undocumented people who file taxes with an ITIN number would be eligible. The legislation would also establish a banking system through the postal service for “unbanked, underbanked and individuals experiencing housing instability” to receive payments."
women,"The idea of a guaranteed income, or free money with no conditions, to improve economic and other outcomes for low-income people is not new. It’s been tested at significant scale in countries such as Kenya and India with positive results, including improved nutrition, and in Finland, where preliminary results showed improved health and well-being. "
women,"“Poverty is a choice. For too long we have prioritized endless growth while millions are homeless, hungry or without healthcare,” Omar said in a statement. “We as a nation have the ability to make sure everyone has their basic needs like food, housing and healthcare met.”"
women,"In the U.S, a federal report from 2019 found that nearly 40% of Americans could not afford to cover a $400 surprise expense."
women,"In Mississippi, Magnolia Mother’s Trust gave $1,000 per month to Black moms, who said it made a difference in their lives. "
women,"Some pilot guaranteed income projects here have shown promise: In Stockton, California, 125 people were sent $500 in cash each month for a year. A study found that recipients had better job prospects, improved mental health and used the cash to purchase basic necessities. "
women,"Omar pointed to the success of the federal government’s own recent experiment in giving cash directly to Americans: Millions of Americans received three rounds of stimulus checks during the COVID-19 pandemic. These payments were found to substantially reduce economic hardship, enabling people to buy food and pay bills, and reducing anxiety and depression. "
women,"And Oakland, California, is set to launch one of the largest guaranteed income programs in the nation so far, giving $500 of unconditional cash each month to 600 low-income families of color. "
women,"Lenny Kravitz may have been joking on Instagram when he said he was “ready” to audition for a role for a third installment of the “Magic Mike” film franchise, but some fans think it’s no laughing matter. "
women,The rock star inspired the “Magic Mike” idea after he posted photos on Instagram on Wednesday that featured him holding a power tool while wearing an open shirt. 
women,"Kravitz’s photo garnered a lot of attention, including a response from Channing Tatum, who said, in part: “Will be calling you shortly to get into your schedule my friend.”"
women,"“Wednesday. 2:55pm. Building a deck,” he wrote in the post’s caption. "
women,“You auditioning for MM3?” she quipped to Tatum in the comments section of the post. 
women,“I’ve been ready!” the rock star responded. 
women,"The “Fly Away” singer’s daughter, Zoë Kravitz, chimed in and jokingly encouraged Tatum to consider her dad for a role in a third “Magic Mike” movie. Tatum starred in the first 2012 “Magic Mike” film and its sequel, “Magic Mike XXL,” in 2015. "
women,Fans of Lenny Kravitz have apparently been ready too. 
women,"“You sure have,” one commenter wrote. "
women,"“Just take all my money lol,” another wrote. "
women,"Kravitz often talks about his strong bond with his daughter, whom he shares with actor Lisa Bonet. "
women,"Last year, he told Trevor Noah during a virtual appearance on “The Daily Show” that his relationship with Zoë Kravitz is a “true blessing.”"
women,"While the future remains unclear on whether Tatum and Lenny Kravitz will ever work together on a “Magic Mike” film, Zoë Kravitz and Tatum have a project in the works. "
women,"Zoë Kravitz will make her film directing debut with a thriller titled “Pussy Island,” starring Tatum, Deadline reported last month. The film is set to begin production early next year on an undisclosed tropical island, the publication reported. "
women,"While the set photos of the cast filming around Italy in full period regalia have already set the internet ablaze, we haven’t been properly introduced to the family behind the titular fashion house at the center of the Ridley Scott-directed film."
women,“We are all ready!” wrote another. 
women,"Lady Gaga was born this way, and by that we mean Italian, so behold the gloriously over-the-top character posters for her upcoming film “House of Gucci.” "
women,"“House of Gucci,” based off the book of the same name by Sara Gay Forden, explores one of the most scandalous crimes in Italian history: the assassination of the former head of the Gucci fashion house, Maurizio Gucci. "
women,"Gaga plays Patrizia Reggiani, who was tried and convicted of orchestrating the 1995 murder of her ex-husband Maurizio (Adam Driver), with Al Pacino, Jared Leto and Jeremy Irons appearing in the film as various Gucci family members. "
women,"Now, we have a better look at the players in question, including a close-up of the “Chromatica” singer, who sports a bold red lip and a black funeral veil in her poster portrait. "
women,"And then there’s Leto, who — in a surprise to no one — has undergone a complete and totally unnecessary transformation to play Gucci family patriarch Paolo Gucci."
women,"“Spanning three decades of love, betrayal, decadence, revenge, and ultimately murder, we see what a name means, what it’s worth, and how far a family will go for control,” the film’s description promises."
women,"Both Gaga and Leto included the word the Italian word “stasera” — which translates to “this evening” — on their social media posts sharing the posters, hinting that a trailer for the film would be arriving shortly. "
women,The Grammy-winner has been teasing fans about her first role since “A Star Is Born” for quite some time now.
women,"“Signore e Signora Gucci,” she captioned the post."
women,"In March, she revealed the first official photo from the film, showing herself and Driver looking very much in character, sporting ’80s winter looks. "
women,"While fans have been practically foaming at the mouth for more “House of Gucci” content, the real-life family hasn’t been as thrilled to see one of its darkest chapters play out on screen. "
women,"Patrizia Gucci, one of Maurizio Gucci’s second cousins, slammed the project on behalf of her family in April, telling The Associated Press that they were “truly disappointed” by the film. "
women,"“They are stealing the identity of a family to make a profit, to increase the income of the Hollywood system,” she said. “Our family has an identity, privacy. We can talk about everything. but there is a borderline that cannot be crossed.”"
women,"She took particular issue with the creative license Scott’s production was taking with depicting her grandfather, Aldo Gucci, who is played by Pacino in the film. "
women,“House of Gucci” is scheduled for a theatrical release on Nov. 24. 
women,"“My grandfather was a very handsome man, like all the Guccis, and very tall, blue eyes and very elegant. He is being played by Al Pacino, who is not very tall already, and this photo shows him as fat, short, with sideburns, really ugly. Shameful, because he doesn’t resemble him at all,” she said."
women,Take a look at the rest of the character posters below.
women,"Patrizia Gucci also blasted Leto’s casting as Paolo Gucci, expressing her displeasure over his prosthetics: “Horrible, horrible. I still feel offended.” "
women,"Spears’ mother, Lynne Spears, was also quoted in the petition earlier this week accusing Jame Spears of engaging in an “appalling and inexcusable” physical altercation with the singer’s two teenage sons. "
women,"However, the singer has also expressed frustration with Montgomery over the amount of therapy Montgomery has allegedly forced her to attend, saying during her testimony that Montgomery was “starting to kind of take it too far with me.”"
women,"The petition on behalf of Jodi Montgomery, who has overseen the personal and medical aspects of Spears’ conservatorship since 2019, was filed in support of removing the singer’s father, Jamie Spears, from his role as conservator of her finances ― a demand the star’s legal counsel made earlier this week. "
women,"Jamie Spears acting as his daughter’s conservator is “not in [her] best interest” and the star’s doctors agree, the petition stated. "
women,Jamie Spears filed court documents last month saying he wasn’t familiar with many of the claims his daughter made during her testimony before a judge in June— including one that she’s been forced to remain on birth control — as he’s merely the conservator of her estate and no longer conservator of her person. 
women,"“Ms. Montgomery respectfully notes that Ms. Spears’s medical team agrees that it is not in the best interest of the Conservatee for Mr. Spears to remain Conservator,” it sad."
women,"Mathew Rosengart, the first legal counsel Spears had permission to select on her own in her conservatorship case, has only sought the removal of her father from the conservatorship. His petition also asks the court to replace Jamie Spears with Jason Rubin, a professional fiduciary and forensic accountant with significant experience as a conservator."
women,"But it was her father whom Britney Spears singled out in her testimony last month, saying he’d threatened her and forced her to work against her will. He “should be in jail,” the singer said."
women,A judge will consider the requests at a hearing scheduled for December.
women,"Britney Spears’ medical team is in favor of removing her father as one of her conservators, according to a petition that attorneys for the pop star’s other conservator filed Thursday. "
women,"Megan Rapinoe slammed in the clincher after Rose Lavelle, Alex Morgan and Christen Press also scored in the shootout."
women,"The U.S. women’s soccer team, which appeared uninspired during much of the Tokyo Olympics, secured a gritty quarterfinal victory over the Netherlands Friday."
women,"The top-ranked Americans eliminated the fourth-ranked Dutch women on penalty kicks, 4-2, after regulation and two extra-time periods resulted in a 2-2 deadlock."
women,"The nail-biter enabled Team USA to avoid tying its earliest exit in Olympic history, which was at the 2016 Rio Games. The last time the team advanced to the semifinals was in 2012, when it won gold."
women,Sam Mewis and Lynn Williams scored the U.S. goals in regulation before the Netherlands’ Vivianne Miedema tied the game at 2-2 with her second goal.
women,"U.S. goalkeeper Alyssa Naeher blocked a penalty kick in the 80th minute in regulation, and made two stops in the shootout. The U.S. will play Canada in the semifinals on Monday."
women,The U.S. is attempting to become the first defending World Cup champion to follow with an Olympic gold.
women,Here are some of the highlights:
women,"U.S. gymnast Sunisa Lee shared her feelings about her incredible gold medal winfor women’s individual all-around gymnastics, telling fans that it’s “a dream come true.”"
women,"On Thursday, the 18-year-old Hmong American and Minnesota native posted a snapshot on Instagram of herself smooching her new bling at the Tokyo Olympics."
women,"“OLYMPIC ALL-AROUND CHAMPION,” she wrote in the caption. “So surreal. i can’t thank you all enough for the love and support. thank you to everyone who has believed in me and never gave up on me. this is a dream come true 😭💕WE DID IT.”"
women,"
Lee’s gold medal marks the fifth year straight that Americans have taken the all-around Olympic final. Biles won the gold in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, and was preceded by Gabby Douglas in London in 2012, Nastia Liukin in Beijing in 2008, and Carly Patterson in Athens, Greece, in 2004.
Biles sent her congratulations to Lee via Instagram, posting a video of an ecstatic Lee with her medal at their hotel and a photo of them taking a selfie together.
“OLYMPIC CHAMPION RIGHT HERE !!! So so so beyond proud of you!!!!” the post read.Lee is the first Hmong American to win a gold medal at the Olympics. Many people within the Hmong American and wider Asian American communities have come out on social media to show their support and commemorate her win.
“I literally can’t stop crying! All the sacrifice a refugee family had to endure to put you on that podium and now the world has a chance to know who we are. So proud to be Hmong American today!” one person wrote on Twitter.
“Sunisa Lee - you are a trailblazer,” another fan wrote. “One for the history books.”"
women,"Simone Biles, last year’s winner of the same women’s category, withdrew from the competition earlier this week in an effort to focus on her mental health. Lee, Biles’ teammate, then took the title of highest-qualifying U.S. gymnast for the all-around final."
women,The actor talked about portraying Richard Williams in an Instagram post after the trailer for the film was released on Wednesday. 
women,"The film, directed by Reinaldo Marcus Green and written by Zach Baylin, shows the journey of “an undeterred father instrumental in raising two of the most extraordinarily gifted athletes of all time,” a description for the film reads, in part. "
women,"Will Smith says portraying the father of Venus Williams and Serena Williams in the upcoming film, “King Richard,” is one of his “greatest honors.” "
women,"Smith pointed out that he had had the honor of portraying other influential people such as legendary boxer Muhammad Ali for the 2001 film “Ali” and entrepreneur Chris Gardner, who inspired the 2006 movie “The Pursuit of Happyness.”"
women,"“One of the greatest honors as an actor is to be able to celebrate someone’s legacy while they’re still here creating it,” he wrote in the caption for the post."
women,Smith described “King Richard” as the “origin story for some REAL DEAL superheroes!!” he wrote on Instagram. 
women,The “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” actor earned a Best Actor nomination for both of those roles. “Ali” hit theaters 15 years before the boxing legend died. Smith noted that portraying iconic figures in films while they’re alive to see it is a “fulfilling and expansive experience beyond compare.”
women,"Smith helped produce “King Richard” via his production company Westbrook. Venus Williams, Serena Williams and their sister Isha Price are among the executive producers of the film. "
women,The movie is set to hit U.S. theaters on Nov. 19 and will stream on HBO Max via its ad-free plan for 31 days following its theatrical release. 
women,LONDON (AP) — A woman who secretly swapped seven pebbles for 4.2 million pounds ($5.7 million) worth of diamonds has been sent to prison for her role in the audacious heist at a luxury jewelry store in London’s tony Mayfair district.
women,"Lakatos was part of an international gang that fled to France after stealing the diamonds from Boodles on New Bond Street on March 10, 2016. The gems haven’t been recovered."
women,"Lulu Lakatos, 60, was sentenced Wednesday to 5 1/2 years in prison after a jury at Southwark Crown Court in London found her guilty of conspiracy to steal."
women,"In the days leading up to the heist, the criminals held a series of meetings with Boodles staff on the pretense that they represented a wealthy Russian investor who was looking to purchase gems, police said."
women,"“This was an audacious theft, carried out in plain view of experienced and professional staff at a renowned jewelers,” Detective Sgt. William Man of London’s Metropolitan Police Service said in a statement. “The meticulous planning and execution of this theft reveals to me that those involved were highly skilled criminals.”"
women,"After she inspected the gems, which included a 20-carat heart-shaped diamond valued at more than 2.2 million pounds, they were individually wrapped and placed in a locked bag that was supposed to be held in the jeweler’s vault until payment was received. But when Boodles’ own expert became suspicious the next day, the bag was X-rayed and the store discovered nothing but seven ordinary pebbles."
women,"Lakatos had used a distraction to swap the bag containing the diamonds for an identical one containing the pebbles before it was locked in the vault, according to security camera video released by police."
women,"Lakatos, who was born in Romania and lived in France, posed as a gem expert named “Anna” who then went to Boodles to value seven diamonds for the buyer."
women,"After leaving the store, Lakatos handed the bag containing the diamonds to one of her female accomplices, before ditching the long coat, hat and scarf she wore as a disguise and boarding a high-speed Eurostar train to France."
women,She was arrested on a European arrest warrant last September and returned to Britain to stand trial.
women,Two men who worked with Lakatos previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal and were sentenced to 3 years and eight months in prison. Police are still investigating the involvement of two other women.
women,LONDON (AP) — It’s time for another “Doctor Who” regeneration.
women,"Chibnall, who took the reins at the same time, said he and Whittaker “made a ‘three series and out’ pact with each other at the start of this once-in-a-lifetime blast.”"
women,Jamie Lee Curtis is joyfully announcing that her younger daughter is transgender. 
women,"The BBC said Thursday that star Jodie Whittaker will leave the venerable science fiction series next year, along with showrunner Chris Chibnall. Whittaker will bow out after a new six-episode series later this year and three specials in 2022."
women,"The series’ central character is a galaxy-hopping, extra-terrestrial Time Lord who can regenerate into new bodies. Whitaker is the 13th actor, and first woman, to play the titular Doctor since the show began in 1963."
women,"Speculation has already started about who will replace Whittaker, with bookmakers offering odds on actors including Olly Alexander (“It’s a Sin”), Vicky McClure (“Line of Duty”) and Michaela Coel (“I May Destroy You”)."
women,"The screen legend, who shares two children with husband Christopher Guest, revealed in an interview with AARP on Wednesday that she has “watched in wonder and pride as our son became our daughter Ruby.”"
women,"Making sure to note that she received Ruby’s permission to share the news, Curtis said that the 25-year-old works as a computer gaming editor and is engaged to be married next year."
women,"“I will officiate,” Curtis added about the upcoming nuptials."
women,"The 62-year-old actor said her daughter’s transition helped challenge her past beliefs that gender identity and expression are fixed, explaining that this current stage of life is a “constant metamorphosis.”"
women,"“I am somebody who sheds every day,” she told the magazine. “Let’s get rid of that, I don’t need that. It’s all about old ideas that don’t work anymore.”"
women,"Curtis and Guest also have a daughter named Annie, a 34-year-old dance instructor who is married."
women,"On the topic of potentially becoming a grandparent in the future, Curtis said, “Not yet, but I do hope to.”"
women,"The actor, who has been sober for more than 20 years, said she has a special place in her heart for “vulnerable children,” which has moved her to write around a dozen books for young kids and support multiple children’s charities."
women,"Elsewhere in the interview, Curtis reflected on her own tumultuous upbringing, marked by heavy substance abuse, as the child of Hollywood stars Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh."
women,"The actor shared a photo of the magazine cover Wednesday on Instagram, writing in the caption that she is “happy that my family is safe and flourishing.”"
women,"“There is nothing harder than being a child, and I am a product of a lot of divorces,” Curtis said. “Janet married four times, Bob four, and Tony six. It is what it is, but I think, as a result, I have always had a feeling for vulnerable children.”"
women,"“Doctor Who” ran from 1963 to 1989, and was revived to acclaim in 2005. Since then, the Doctor has been played by Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant, Matt Smith, Peter Capaldi and Whittaker, who took over in 2017."
women,"Among her many upcoming film projects, including the much-anticipated sequels to the recent “Halloween” reboot, Curtis is slated to bring the real-life story of Sara Cunningham, a mother who offers “free mom hugs” to LGBTQ people, to the big screen."
women,"Scarlett Johansson is suing the Walt Disney Co. over its streaming release of “Black Widow,” which she said breached her contract and deprived her of potential earnings."
women,"After seeing a viral Facebook post about how Cunningham, who has a gay son, steps in as a stand-in mom for same-sex couples on their wedding day, Curtis reached out and bought the rights to her memoir."
women,"In a lawsuit filed Thursday morning in Los Angeles Superior Court, the “Black Widow” star and executive producer said her contract guaranteed an exclusive theatrical release. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news of the lawsuit."
women,"Johansson’s potential earnings were tied to the box office performance of the film, which the company released simultaneously in theaters and on its streaming service Disney+ for a $30 rental."
women,"“In the months leading up to this lawsuit, Ms. Johansson gave Disney and Marvel every opportunity to right their wrong and make good on Marvel’s promise,” the lawsuit said. “Disney intentionally induced Marvel’s breach of the Agreement, without justification, in order to prevent Ms. Johansson from realizing the full benefit of her bargain with Marvel.”"
women,Disney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
women,"Once taboo, hybrid theatrical and streaming releases have become more normal for many of the biggest studios during the pandemic, with each adopting its own unique strategy. This weekend, Disney is employing the same strategy with “Jungle Cruise,” and next weekend Warner Bros. big budget “The Suicide Squad” opens both in theaters and on HBO Max."
women,"The revised hybrid release strategies over the 16 months have occasionally led to public spats from not just theater owners, but stars, filmmakers and financiers who are unhappy with the potential lost revenues and the alleged unilateral decision-making involved."
women,"The WSJ said Warner Media, for instance, paid over $200 million in “amended agreements” with talent over its decision to release its entire 2021 slate simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max."
women,"But none have been as public as Johansson’s lawsuit. The actor, who has been in nine Marvel movies going back to 2010’s “Iron Man 2,” quickly became a trending topic on Twitter on Thursday after news of the suit broke."
women,"After its release was delayed more than a year because of COVID-19, “Black Widow” debuted to a pandemic-best of $80 million in North America and $78 million from international theaters three weeks ago, but theatrical grosses declined sharply after that. In its second weekend in release, the National Association of Theater Owners issued a rare statement criticizing the strategy asserting that simultaneous release lends itself only to lost profits and higher quality piracy."
women,"The backlash over DaBaby’s sexist, homophobic remarks intensified this week with the release of a music video that appeared to reference the ongoing controversy. "
women,"On Wednesday afternoon, the rapper unveiled “Giving What It’s Supposed to Give,” which he self-directed. At one point in the video, he holds up a sign that reads “AIDS,” while rapping the lyric: “Bitch, we like AIDS, I’m on your ass, we on your ass, bitch, we won’t go away.”"
women,"The clip concludes with a rainbow-colored message telling viewers, “Don’t fight hate with hate. My apologies for being me the same way you want the freedom to be you.” "
women,Reaction to the video was mixed. 
women,Watch the “Giving What It’s Supposed to Give” video below.
women,"“I think DaBaby might’ve just beaten Cancel Culture,” one person wrote on Instagram. Another, however, tweeted: “I’m going to disrespectfully pass on this. You and your team should’ve thought twice about releasing this one. Extremely disrespectful on many many levels. I encourage you to get the help you desperately need.” "
women,"Footage captured by TMZ shows the rapper urging the crowd to put their phones up “if you didn’t show up today with HIV/AIDS, or other STDs that’ll make you die in two to three weeks.” "
women,"DaBaby, whose real name is Jonathan Lyndale Kirk, came under fire Sunday after making a series of derogatory statements about women, gay men and those living with HIV during a performance at the Rolling Loud Festival in Miami. "
women,"Though DaBaby issued a formal apology on Twitter Tuesday, his remarks nonetheless drew swift condemnation from Elton John, Dua Lipa and Demi Lovato, among other stars. On Wednesday, men’s fashion company boohooMAN announced it had scrapped its partnership with the rapper. "
women,"Though the release of “Giving What It’s Supposed to Give” seems auspiciously timed, DaBaby said filming on the video had wrapped one day before his Rolling Loud Festival appearance."
women,"“It never seizes [sic] to amaze me the way God put me in situations I’m already equipped to handle,” he wrote on Instagram. "
women,"It’s unclear, however, whether the video’s concluding statement was added later. "
women,"“I was watching on the news and seeing everyone walk back,” Claire told HuffPost. “It felt kind of useless for me to be that close and not kind of do anything proactive about it.”"
women,"A citywide curfew was in place, and she could hear the helicopters hovering in the sky. Outside her window, “Claire” could see Trump supporters streaming back from the Capitol to a hotel near her home, carrying their flags and wearing “Make America Great Again” hats."
women,"Six months ago, on a cold Wednesday night, a 20-something communications professional in Washington, D.C., was watching a remarkable and disturbing scene unfold on her television screen."
women,"Supporters of outgoing President Donald Trump, who believed online conspiracy theories and the president’s lies about a stolen election, had breached the U.S. Capitol in a brutally violent attack that police officers would later describe as “medieval.” They brought bats. They brought hockey sticks. They brought Molotov cocktails. They brought stun guns. They brought firearms. They brought pepper spray. At least one Trump fanatic was carrying a metal whip."
women,"By that evening, before Congress had formally certified President Joe Biden’s win in the early morning hours of Jan. 7, the FBI was seeking information from the public. The bureau wanted Americans to identify the rioters."
women,Claire had put a pause on online dating during the coronavirus pandemic. But she decided to fire up Bumble. She’d had what she described as an “on-and-off relationship with Bumble” (she tended to prefer Hinge) but knew that Bumble would let her “endlessly scroll through these guys” based on location and political affiliation. 
women,"“OK, fine,” Claire thought. “I will.”"
women,"She deleted a few photos that showed her doing “non-MAGA things” and “clearly liberal stuff”: that image of her in the pink pussy hat at the Women’s March wasn’t going to fly. She settled on a main profile image (it may have been a shot of her on a boat, or perhaps a photograph of her engaged in a “vanilla recreational activity” like visiting a brewery, she can’t quite recall). She turned on the “conservative” filter, and she got to swiping. For democracy."
women,"Bumble is the dating app where “women always make the first move.” Over the course of the next few days, Claire made plenty of them. Like many singles in D.C., Claire has “almost always” passed on potential suitors who lived across the river in northern Virginia. Her MAGA alter-ego, on the other hand, didn’t have any reservations about bros located in Arlington and Alexandria. So when Andrew ― a 32-year-old from Houston who was located eight miles away in Alexandria ― popped up on her screen, Claire swiped right. "
women,“Hey how’s it going?” she wrote.
women,"They got to chatting. She made small talk, and basically tried to get Andrew thinking they were on the same page. Eventually, Andrew told Claire he was at the Capitol."
women,"“Were you near all the action?” she asked. “Yes,” he replied. “From the very beginning.”"
women,"When Andrew claimed he’d stopped “agitators” who “were clearly antifa people” during the attack, Claire stayed in character and kept pushing for more info."
women,"“Wait wow they were in the crowd? That’s wild, how could you tell?” she asked. Andrew continued mansplaining his conspiracy theories about how undercover left-wingers had actually been responsible for the actions of the pro-Trump mob."
women,"“Majority of the people attacking police and smashing windows were all antifa. They just threw on a Trump hat or shirt they bought on the street,” Andrew told Claire. “They have had this planned out for weeks.”"
women,"Claire wanted to know whether Andrew had plans to return to D.C. to interrupt Biden’s inauguration, so she kept the conversation going. When Andrew proposed a video chat, she told him she was at a beer garden with friends. (She was not.)"
women,"Andrew continued to open up, sending Claire an image of himself he said he’d taken about a half-hour before being “sprayed.” He was “just standing there” when an officer sprayed him, he claimed. "
women,"Still in character, she suggested she could show him the beer garden if he returned. Andrew seemed open to it: He might be headed back to D.C. soon with other “Patriots ready and willing to head back.”"
women,Claire had picked up a skill on dating apps that ended up being very helpful for finding insurrectionists. She knew how to take the limited amount of information disclosed in a dating app profile and connect it to a guy’s real identity. 
women,"Andrew’s Bumble profile gave away plenty of details, including the name of the business he co-owned, so Claire didn’t have much trouble finding his full name — Andrew Taake — after searching around a bit on Facebook."
women,"Claire estimates she chatted with about a dozen conservatives who attended Trump’s Jan. 6 rally. With the kind of “comically minimal ego-stroking” she used with Andrew, she says, she got three of them to admit they were unlawfully present on the grounds of the Capitol. She sent all three, including Andrew, to the FBI."
women,"“I basically just asked, ‘Wow, crazy, tell me more’ on repeat until they gave me enough,” she said. “One of my friends was like, ’You basically got all these confessions just being, like, ‘Haha! Then what?’”"
women,"About three months after the Capitol attack, an FBI special agent from Texas got in touch with Claire. The female special agent (“Let the women do the work,” Claire joked) asked a bunch of questions that made it evident they were in somewhat new territory: Not many FBI cases involve dating app stings. “Clearly, it’s not a common scenario,” Claire said."
women,"More than six months after Jan. 6, Claire was scrolling through Instagram over the weekend when she saw a headline: “Capitol attack suspect turned in by Bumble match.” The post included a familiar name: Andrew Taake. He’d been arrested in Houston on Friday, July 23. "
women,"On Bumble, Taake had claimed that “antifa” was actually behind the violence at the Capitol. The video showed otherwise. The feds say Taake was caught on video pepper-spraying officers and attacking others with a metal whip."
women,"Online sleuths who are part of the “sedition hunters” community would label Taake ― who was known as 257-AFO (Assault on Federal Officers) on the FBI’s Capitol wanted list ― as #MacerInBlack, and track his actions throughout the Jan. 6 attack. They’d separately identify him using a facial recognition website that turned up mugshots from his prior arrests."
women,"One “sedition hunter” told HuffPost that arrests like Taake’s are “very comforting” because they make the community realize they are not operating in a “black hole,” even if the FBI takes longer than they would like to make an arrest. "
women,But Claire’s work on Bumble in the immediate aftermath of Jan. 6 had already given the FBI a way to build the case unveiled last week.
women,"“It gives us hope that all of these other people who have yet to be arrested have been IDed by other people,” the person said."
women,"Claire has been around D.C. for a few years now, so she was perhaps more jaded than most Americans about how long the process would take, given how much information was being sent to the FBI. "
women,"Women on dating apps in D.C. got to work after the Jan. 6 attack, as several media outlets covered at the time. (“Honestly all the girls in DC bragging about being better than the FBI at tracking down guys better step it up right now,” read one post on the popular Instagram account Overheard District, which also posted about “catfishing the Trump supporting insurrectionists on dating apps.”)"
women,"“I had read they were drowning in tips,” she said. “I kind of expected, as a federal entity, that it would move a little bit slower ... I figured it was going to be a lot of red tape and bureaucracy.”"
women,And Taake isn’t the first Jan. 6 defendant arrested off of a Bumble tip: Another dating app user told Robert Chapman “We are not a match” before turning him in to the FBI. But Taake certainly is the most violent defendant caught off of a Bumble tip to date.
women,"“It definitely does feel like it’s kind of a team sport,” Claire said. “It was something that I literally just did alone in my apartment, but also it feels not like an isolated incident. It feels like a drop in a larger bucket.”"
women,"Several of Claire’s potential targets didn’t fully take the bait. One, who said he was on a metro train back to Arlington when the Capitol attack unfolded, seemed to catch on to what Claire was up to. “Also, for clarity up front, your profile says conservative, is that genuine?” Greg wrote. “It’s simply pretty rare in this area, that’s why I ask :).”"
women,But many of those she spoke with were happy to talk about conspiracy theories and how they believed the election was stolen.
women,"Taake does not have a court date set in D.C., and there’s no attorney listed on his court docket. But federal Magistrate Judge Christina A. Bryan of the Southern District of Texas had him remanded into custody."
women,"“A couple of guys were parroting election fraud talking points that were very on-brand for the MAGA rally,” she said. “They wanted to regurgitate a lot of these ideas to somebody, and I seemed like a willing participant. It didn’t take a lot of arm twisting to get them to start talking about it.”"
women,So Taake will be coming back to D.C. after all — in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service.
women,"BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — A Spanish judge investigating alleged tax fraud by Colombian musician Shakira recommended on Thursday that the case go to trial after concluding there is evidence that the pop star could have avoided her fiscal obligations to the state."
women,Judge Marco Juberías wrote that his three-year probe found there existed “sufficient evidence of criminality” for the case to go to a trial judge.
women,The decision can be appealed.
women,"Shakira, 44, denied any wrongdoing when she testified in June 2019. Her public relations firm said that she had immediately paid what she owed once she was informed of the debt by the Tax Office."
women,Champion gymnast Simone Biles said Wednesday that the supportive response to her withdrawal from the Tokyo Olympics has made her realize she’s more than her sport.
women,Biles withdrew from the women’s gymnastics individual all-around final and the all-around team final last week. She said she was not in a good mental space to compete. 
women,"Prosecutors charged the singer in December 2019 with not paying 14.5 million euros ($16.4 million) in taxes in Spain between 2012 and 2014, when she lived mostly in the country despite having an official residence in Panama."
women,"Shakira faces a possible fine and even possible jail time if found guilty of tax evasion. However, a judge can waive prison time for first-time offenders if they are sentenced to less than two years behind bars."
women,There’s been a wave of support for Biles over her decision to prioritize her well-being despite global pressure to perform. Numerous other gymnasts and athletes have revealed they’ve gone through similar challenges.
women,"Michael Phelps, the Olympic swimming legend, said it broke his heart to hear of the gymnast’s struggles and said he related to the pressure Biles was feeling."
women,"“The outpouring love & support I’ve received has made me realize I’m more than my accomplishments and gymnastics which I never truly believed before,” she tweeted. "
women,"“I felt like I was carrying, as Simone said, the weight of the world on your shoulders, so yeah, it’s a tough situation,” he said.
Former Olympic gymnast Dominique Moceanu said she competed with a severe injury in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics when she was just 14. She said Biles’s decision “demonstrates that we have a say in our own health — “a say” I NEVER felt I had as an Olympian.”
Michelle Obama also joined the avalanche of support, telling Biles she was proud of her.
“Am I good enough? Yes, I am. The mantra I practice daily,” the former first lady told Biles in a tweet. “We are proud of you and we are rooting for you.”
USA Gymnastics said it wholeheartedly supported Biles’s decision to step back and applauded her bravery in prioritizing her well-being.
“Her courage shows, yet again, why she is a role model for so many,” it said."
women,NEW YORK (AP) — A former member of NXIVM leader Keith Raniere’s inner circle who was charged in his sex trafficking enterprise avoided prison at sentencing Wednesday after prosecutors cited her extraordinary cooperation.
women,"Salzman testified about being held down in 2017 while another Raniere devotee used a cauterizing pen to etch his initials into an area near her pelvis, describing a bizarre initiation procedure."
women,"Lauren Salzman was sentenced in Brooklyn federal court to five years probation for her role in the scandal-ridden, cult-like secret society of brainwashed women, who included millionaires and actors. He also ordered her to perform 300 hours of community service."
women,"“Master, please brand me. It would be an honor,” she recalled saying just before she was branded."
women,"In a letter two weeks ago to Judge Nicholas G. Garaufis, prosecutors noted that her guilty plea to racketeering would normally call for a sentence of seven to nine years in prison. But they cited her “credible, detailed” testimony against Raniere at his 2019 trial as reason for leniency."
women,"Salzman, a one-time member of NXIVM’s executive board who pleaded guilty and agreed to become a government cooperator, was one of two witnesses to testify at Raniere’s trial about submitting to a barbaric ritual meant to show his slaves devotion to him."
women,"She also testified that she organized other brandings, inviting women to her house, where they were required to strip naked and sit blindfolded in a circle as part of the ritual."
women,"The first woman branded, she said, “was screaming and squealing.”"
women,"In a letter to the judge prior to her sentencing, Salzman wrote: “I wish I could take my participation back. I wish I had been stronger and seen things sooner. ... I can’t even begin to imagine the pain, feelings of betrayal, feelings of violation and lasting emotional trauma that the victims have experienced.”"
women,She testified that it was “the most painful thing I’ve ever experienced.”
women,"At sentencing, she apologized to NXIVM’s victims."
women,"Salzman’s attorney, Hector J. Diaz, said after her sentencing that his client “looks forward to closing a very difficult and incredibly unfortunate chapter to her life. Today marked another step toward this goal."
women,He added: “She wants to be respectful of the victims in this case and will not make further statements at this time. She looks forward to living a private and productive life.”
women,"At Raniere’s sentencing, 15 victims called for a lengthy prison term."
women,"Last October, Garaufis sentenced Raniere to 120 years in prison for turning some adherents into sex slaves branded with his initials and sexually abusing a 15-year-old."
women,"
Ex-U.S. Olympic gymnast Dominique Moceanu feels Simone Biles’ pain ― and her own.
After Biles dropped out of the Tokyo Olympics’ team competition and the all-around for mental health reasons, Moceanu recalled a time when she had no say in her own welfare at the Games. The 1996 gold medalist shared an old clip of her, already nursing a leg injury, falling on her head on the balance beam in the competition:
"
women,"As authorities closed in on Raniere, he fled to Mexico with Mack and others to try to reconstitute the group there. He was arrested and sent to the United States in March 2018; Mack was arrested a few days later."
women,"Moceanu earned her gold as part of the U.S. team, dubbed the “Magnificent Seven,” which won the women’s team title."
women,She wrote of her alleged mistreatment by coaches Marta and Bela Karolyi in her 2012 memoir Off Balance.
women,"Democratic lawmakers want better workplace protections for domestic workers, who often work behind closed doors and are vulnerable to abuse and exploitation. "
women,"Vice President Kamala Harris first introduced this bill in 2019, when she was a U.S. senator from California. "
women,"On Thursday, Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and Sens. Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) reintroduced the “Domestic Workers Bill of Rights Act,” which would ensure nannies, house cleaners and home care aides have basic rights such as paid sick days, meal and rest breaks, harassment protections and pay for shifts that are canceled last-minute."
women,"Amid the coronavirus pandemic, domestic workers were on the front lines of the crisis, with many house cleaners abruptly losing their jobs and nannies and home care workers continuing to do essential care work in high-risk conditions while exposed to others indoors."
women,"The more than 2 million domestic workers in the U.S. have historically been excluded from basic labor protections under federal and state laws. Currently, only 10 states have bills of rights for domestic workers enshrined in law, including New York, Illinois and California."
women,"The vast majority of domestic workers are women, and they are disproportionately women of color and immigrants. "
women,"Meanwhile, undocumented workers were excluded from Congress’s multiple COVID-19 stimulus checks."
women,"In a survey of over 2,400 domestic workers in March, the National Domestic Workers Alliance found that more than a third of the workers reported not receiving any meal and rest breaks, and, of those who did get breaks, only 34% were paid for that time. And when their work was canceled once they had shown up for a job, only 24% of the workers reported getting any pay. "
women,"Last month, “Smallville” actor Allison Mack was sentenced to three years in prison for her role in NXIVM. Prosecutors said she cooperated with the prosecution after pleading guilty in the case."
women,"Her sentence included prison time after prosecutors said she became a “master” for “slaves” she ordered “to perform labor, take nude photographs, and in some cases, to engage in sex acts with Raniere.”"
women,"Without cooperating, Mack would have faced between 14 and 17 1/2 years behind bars, according to federal sentencing guidelines."
women,U.S. gymnast Sunisa Lee won a gold medal for women’s individual all-around gymnastics at the Tokyo Olympics on Thursday.
women,"Lee, an 18-year-old Hmong-American from Minnesota, became the highest-qualifying U.S. gymnast for the all-around final after Simone Biles, considered by many to be the world’s greatest gymnast, dropped out of the competition this week. Biles cited mental health concerns in explaining her decision."
women,Lee is the fifth straight American to claim victory in the all-around Olympic final. Rebeca Andrade of Brazil won silver and Angelina Melnikova of Russia took home the bronze.
women,"With a total of 57.433 points, Lee edged out Andrade, who became the first Latin American athlete to earn a gymnastics all-around medal. Lee’s spectacular uneven bars set ― the hardest one executed in the competition so far ― secured her lead in the final, according to The Associated Press."
women,"Video showed Lee’s family and friends in Minnesota watching her soar to victory, with dozens screaming in delight when it was clear she was going to take home the top prize. "

business,The Occupational Safety and Health Administration has issued nearly $1 million in fines against a group of companies following the deaths of six poultry workers in Georgia in January.
business,"The workers at Foundation Food Group died after a liquid nitrogen leak at their plant in Gainesville. In announcing the fines, Labor Secretary Marty Walsh said Friday that the company was putting “profits over safety” and had ignored basic responsibilities that could have prevented the leak."
business,"In all, OSHA issued 59 citations to the four companies totaling $998,637. Those are initial penalties, however, and the companies can appeal them and try to negotiate lower fines."
business,Walsh called on Congress to increase OSHA fines so that dangerous employers would be put on notice.
business,"“Six people went to work… and never came home,” Walsh said on a press call. “Make no mistake, this was a very preventable tragedy.”"
business,"OSHA cited three other companies for safety failures following an investigation: Messer LLC, which delivered industrial gas to the plant; Packers Sanitation Services LLC, which cleaned the plant; and FS Group, which provided and serviced mechanical equipment there."
business,"“We’ve seen too many companies cutting corners,” he said. “Workers are still dying every day in this country.” "
business,"According to OSHA, the maintenance workers who first entered the freezer were not trained in how to handle liquid nitrogen. "
business,"Kurt Petermeyer, a regional administrator for OSHA, said on the press call that Foundation Food Group had gone more than a year without a safety director and that the company’s upper management “made no effort” to find other employees who could take on the safety responsibilities created by the vacancy."
business,"Poultry plants use liquid nitrogen to freeze the chicken they process. It is colorless and odorless, often leaving workers unaware when they’re exposed to it. OSHA says three maintenance workers entered a freezer at the Gainesville plant on Jan. 28 and were “overcome immediately” by the nitrogen. They were followed by other workers."
business,"Five workers, including the three maintenance employees, died right away, while a sixth worker died while headed to the hospital. At least a dozen other workers were hospitalized."
business,"Those are significant penalties by OSHA standards because the agency has weak fines by statute. Walsh said the amounts in this case were relatively large but “not enough.” Indeed, the total initial fines amount to just $166,000 for each worker who died."
business,"The fines against Foundation Food Group include six “willful” citations, a graver category that comes with higher penalties. An employer who committed willful violations either knowingly failed to follow the law or “acted with plain indifference” to workers’ safety."
business,Foundation Food Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the citations.
business,"OSHA has been investigating an apparent second leak ― this one of ammonia ― that occurred a few weeks after the liquid nitrogen disaster. The leak prompted workers to file a complaint with OSHA. Foundation Food Group tried to block the agency’s investigation of the second leak, prompting a legal fight with OSHA in federal court."
business,"Petermeyer declined to say whether the company was cooperating at his point. But he did note that OSHA has had a hard time tracking down some workers for interviews, likely because many are undocumented and fear getting in trouble. "
business,"The election was done through mail ballots, and the NLRB had determined beforehand that there would not be drop boxes onsite. Amazon’s insistence on placing a mailbox at work “usurped the [board]’s exclusive role in administering Union elections,” the hearing officer, Kerstin Meyers, wrote. "
business,"A hearing officer for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issued a report this week recommending that workers vote in a fresh election because Amazon tainted the mail-in election that ended in April. The finding undermines what Amazon had cast as a clean and resounding rejection of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) by its workers. "
business,"“We continue to have difficulties in gaining support from the workers because of their fear of retaliation ... or even threats of deportation,” he said. "
business,"The NLRB official said Amazon spoiled the process for a fair election in two particular ways. The company distributed “vote no” paraphernalia to workers in front of supervisors, which may have been coercive, and pressured the U.S. Postal Service to place a mailbox at the warehouse for the election."
business,"Meyers’ finding does not guarantee another election will be held. Her recommendation will now go to a regional director at the NLRB, and after that, potentially to the five-member board in Washington that ultimately settles such disputes on appeal. "
business,"Amazon defended its decision to have a mailbox placed onsite by noting that it was the U.S. Postal Service that put it there. But Meyers wasn’t buying that argument, calling it “mere scapegoating.” She noted that Amazon had procured its own mailbox in case the Postal Service did not decide to place one there. "
business,"The mailbox alone “destroyed the laboratory conditions and justifies a second election,” she concluded. "
business,"The Senate recently confirmed two of President Joe Biden’s picks for that board, assuring that Democrats will have control of it by September. A Democratic majority is more likely than a Republican majority to rule in favor of unions in contentious cases. "
business,"The labor union challenging its election loss at an Amazon warehouse cleared its first major hurdle this week, with a preliminary finding that the online retailer violated labor law during the closely watched union campaign in Alabama earlier this year."
business,"“Amazon’s behavior throughout the election process was despicable,” Appelbaum said in a statement. “Amazon cheated, they got caught, and now they are being held accountable.”"
business,"What’s more, Meyers found that the Postal Service, an independent federal agency, went to unusual lengths to help Amazon, a major client, in what turned out to be a violation of labor law: “In an effort to placate [Amazon], the USPS officials at the highest levels jumped through hoops” to get the company a mailbox as quickly as possible. "
business,"Stuart Appelbaum, the RWDSU’s president, said the union supported Meyers’ findings."
business,Most of the union’s objections to Amazon’s conduct were thrown out.
business,Amazon said in a statement that it plans to appeal any determination that the election be re-run.
business,"“Our employees had a chance to be heard during a noisy time when all types of voices were weighing into the national debate, and at the end of the day, they voted overwhelmingly in favor of a direct connection with their managers and the company,” a spokesperson said in an email. “Their voice should be heard above all else.”"
business,A Postal Service spokesperson did not immediately provide comment when asked for a response.
business,"The vote at Amazon’s warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, was the most closely watched union election in years. Amazon deals with unions in Europe but has so far remained union-free in the U.S. Had the RWDSU won the election, it would have represented a bargaining unit of roughly 6,000 workers and gained the first toehold for labor inside Amazon’s U.S. workforce."
business,"If the NLRB orders a new election, it could be many months before the next vote takes place, and the RWDSU would have a lot more organizing to do if it hoped to win. Thanks to Amazon’s sky-high turnover rate, many of the new workers voting in the second election would not have been around for the first union campaign."
business,"Amazon ran an aggressive anti-union campaign aimed at fraying support for the union. When the ballots were counted, workers had voted 1,798 to 738 against unionization. However, hundreds of ballots were challenged and never counted, and those may have favored the union."
business,"Businesses around the world rushed Saturday to contain a ransomware attack that has paralyzed their computer networks, a situation complicated in the U.S. by offices lightly staffed at the start of the Fourth of July holiday weekend."
business,It’s not yet known how many organizations have been hit by demands that they pay a ransom in order to get their systems working again. But some cybersecurity researchers predict the attack targeting customers of software supplier Kaseya could be one of the broadest ransomware attacks on record — even after a scourge of headline-grabbing attacks over recent months.
business,"The cybersecurity firm ESET says there are victims in least 17 countries, including the United Kingdom, South Africa, Canada, Argentina, Mexico and Spain."
business,"“The number of victims here is already over a thousand and will likely reach into the tens of thousands,” said cybersecurity expert Dmitri Alperovitch of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank. “No other ransomware campaign comes even close in terms of impact.”"
business,"Cybersecurity experts say the REvil gang, a major Russian-speaking ransomware syndicate, appears to be behind the attack that targeted the software company Kaseya, using its network-management package as a conduit to spread the ransomware through cloud-service providers."
business,"In Sweden, most of the grocery chain Coop’s 800 stores were unable to open because their cash registers weren’t working, according to SVT, the country’s public broadcaster. The Swedish State Railways and a major local pharmacy chain were also affected."
business,Kaseya CEO Fred Voccola said in a statement that the company believes it has identified the source of the vulnerability and will “release that patch as quickly as possible to get our customers back up and running.”
business,"Voccola said fewer than 40 of Kaseya’s customers were known to be affected, but experts said the ransomware could still be affecting hundreds more companies that rely on Kaseya’s clients that provide broader IT services."
business,"John Hammond of the security firm Huntress Labs said he was aware of a number of managed-services providers — companies that host IT infrastructure for multiple customers — being hit by the ransomware, which encrypts networks until the victims pay off attackers."
business,"“It’s reasonable to think this could potentially be impacting thousands of small businesses,” said Hammond, basing his estimate on the service providers reaching out to his company for assistance and comments on Reddit showing how others are responding."
business,"At least some victims appeared to be getting ransoms set at $45,000, considered a small demand but one that could quickly add up when sought from thousands of victims, said Brett Callow, a ransomware expert at the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft."
business,"Voccola said the problem is only affecting its “on-premise” customers, which means organizations running their own data centers. It’s not affecting its cloud-based services running software for customers, though Kaseya also shut down those servers as a precaution, he said."
business,"“They just pitched the demand amount at a level most companies will be willing to pay,” he said."
business,The company added in a statement Saturday that “customers who experienced ransomware and receive a communication from the attackers should not click on any links ― they may be weaponized.”
business,"Gartner analyst Katell Thielemann said it’s clear that Kaseya quickly sprang to action, but it’s less clear whether their affected clients had the same level of preparedness."
business,"“They reacted with an abundance of caution,” she said. “But the reality of this event is it was architected for maximum impact, combining a supply chain attack with a ransomware attack.”"
business,Supply chain attacks are those that typically infiltrate widely used software and spread malware as it updates automatically.
business,"Complicating the response is that it happened at the start of a major holiday weekend in the U.S., when most corporate IT teams aren’t fully staffed."
business,"That could also leave those organizations unable to address other security vulnerabilities, such a dangerous Microsoft bug affecting software for print jobs, said James Shank, of threat intelligence firm Team Cymru."
business,"“Customers of Kaseya are in the worst possible situation,” he said. “They’re racing against time to get the updates out on other critical bugs.”"
business,Shank said “it’s reasonable to think that the timing was planned” by hackers for the holiday.
business,"The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said it was affecting hundreds of businesses and was “another reminder that the U.S. government must take the fight to these foreign cybercriminal syndicates” by investigating, disrupting and prosecuting them."
business,The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a statement that it is closely monitoring the situation and working with the FBI to collect more information about its impact.
business,"CISA urged anyone who might be affected to “follow Kaseya’s guidance to shut down VSA servers immediately.” Kaseya runs what’s called a virtual system administrator, or VSA, that’s used to remotely manage and monitor a customer’s network."
business,"The privately held Kaseya is based in Dublin, Ireland, with a U.S. headquarters in Miami."
business,"REvil, the group most experts have tied to the attack, was the same ransomware provider that the FBI linked to an attack on JBS SA, a major global meat processor forced to pay a $11 million ransom, amid the Memorial Day holiday weekend in May."
business,"Active since April 2019, the group provides ransomware-as-a-service, meaning it develops the network-paralyzing software and leases it to so-called affiliates who infect targets and earn the lion’s share of ransoms."
business,U.S. officials have said the most potent ransomware gangs are based in Russia and allied states and operate with Kremlin tolerance and sometimes collude with Russian security services.
business,Alperovitch said he believes the latest attack is financially motivated and not Kremlin-directed.
business,"However, he said it shows that Russian President Vladimir Putin “has not yet moved” on shutting down cybercriminals within Russia after U.S. President Joe Biden pressed him to do so at their June summit in Switzerland."

business,WASHINGTON (AP) — Wages and salaries rose at a healthy pace in the three months ended in June as employers competed to find enough workers to fill millions of available jobs.
business,"
DETROIT (AP) — General Motors is recalling more than 400,000 pickup trucks in the U.S. because the side air bags can explode without warning and spew parts into the cabin.
The recall covers certain 2015 and 2016 Chevrolet and GMC Sierra 1500, 2500, and 3500 trucks.
Documents posted Friday by U.S. safety regulators say the air bag inflator can rupture or the end cap can fly off on both sides of the trucks. Documents say three inflators ruptured in 2015 Silverados last month, one in Florida and two in Texas. All three trucks were unoccupied at the time, and GM says it has no reports of injuries..
The company says a manufacturing defect allowed moisture into the inflator while it was being manufactured, causing corrosion. The inflators were made in Mexico by Joyson Safety Systems.
Dealers will replace both side air bag modules. The company says it has a limited number of replacement parts available. Owners will be notified starting Aug. 16 and they’ll get a second letter when parts are widely available.
About 9,000 of the trucks were recalled last year for the same problem.
"
business,"Pay increased 1% in the second quarter for workers in the private sector, the Labor Department said Friday. That’s down slightly from 1.1% in the first three months of the year but still the second-highest reading in more than a decade."
business,"In the year ending in June, wages and salaries jumped 3.5% for workers in the private sector, the largest increase in more than 14 years. That increase was driven by sharp rise in pay for restaurant and hotel workers of more than 6%."
business,"Total compensation for all employees rose at a slower pace, increasing just 0.7% in the second quarter and 2.9% in the past year. That figure was held back by weaker wage growth in state and local governments, and an unexpected slowing in the growth of benefits, such as health care. Benefits provided by companies rose just 0.3% in the second quarter, down from 0.6% in the first."
business,"Callow said it’s not uncommon for sophisticated ransomware gangs to perform an audit after stealing a victim’s financial records to see what they can really pay, but that won’t be possible at this scale."
business,"Friday’s data comes from the Labor Department’s Employment Cost Index, which measures pay changes for workers that keep their jobs. Unlike some other measures of Americans’ paychecks, it isn’t directly affected by mass layoffs such as the pandemic job losses that occurred in the spring of 2020."
business,"Both reports suggest steady hiring and rising pay should continue to fuel economic growth, though the ongoing spread of the delta variant poses a threat to the recovery. If consumers become more cautious and pull back on travel, eating out, and visiting entertainment venues, growth could slow."
business,"Businesses are being forced to offer higher compensation to attract workers, as customer demand has soared in the spring as the pandemic faded. Companies, particularly in the restaurant and retail industries, are offering sign-on bonuses, wages as high as $15 an hour, and benefits such as retirement plans and pet insurance."
business,"Separately, the government also reported Friday that consumer spending remained strong in June, rising 1%, and overall incomes ticked up 0.1%. That figure includes incomes from other sources besides wages and salaries, such as government benefits and investment income."
business,"The unemployment rate is elevated at 5.9% and millions of Americans are out of work, yet there are also a record number of job openings. Economists say it will take time for the unemployed to match with the right jobs."
business,"Several trends are likely keeping some workers on the sidelines, adding to the pressure on companies to offer higher pay. Many people are worried about COVID-19 and are reluctant to work in jobs that require them to interact with the public. Others may be caring for children and unable to work until schools reopen."
business,And an extra $300 a week in unemployment benefits is likely allowing some of those out of work to hold out for higher-paying jobs. About 22 states have ended that benefit and it will expire nationwide Sept. 6.
business,"Michael Argo has spent 13 years working underground at a coal mine in Brookwood, Alabama, just outside Tuscaloosa. It’s the same mine his father worked at, raising Argo on good union wages and excellent health care coverage. When Argo followed in his father’s footsteps, he believed the job would get better with time and seniority. Instead, he said the job has only gotten worse."
business,"“I’m working more than I ever have, and I’m making less money,” said Argo, a 33-year-old longwall miner who logs 10- to 12-hour days, 20 miles deep in the mine."
business,"Argo estimates that he now earns $20,000 less per year than he did six years ago, before the mine emerged from bankruptcy under the ownership of a new company called Warrior Met Coal."
business,"In 2016, Argo and other members of the United Mine Workers of America agreed to a series of concessions to put Warrior Met on sound financial footing. They lost premium pay for Sundays and long shifts. They went from 11 paid company holidays per year to three: Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve and Christmas. And they consented to a significantly higher share of health care costs than under previous contracts."
business,"Large-scale strikes like the one at Warrior Met are rare in the United States, and not just in the coal industry. Only eight work stoppages involving a thousand workers or more took place last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, though that figure may have been unusually low due to the coronavirus pandemic. In 2019, there were 25 work stoppages of that size. Most strikes, however, last a matter of days or weeks, not months."
business,"According to Argo and other miners, those sacrifices were meant to be temporary. But they said the company has insisted on keeping lower standards in a new five-year contract, leading them into a 1,100-worker strike that began April 1 and has lasted four months. It is a massive work stoppage that harkens back to the days of a more robust coal industry."
business,"Many of the striking workers bussed from Alabama to Manhattan this week to hold a rally Wednesday outside the offices of the investment firm BlackRock. It was an attempt to pressure Warrior Met’s largest shareholder into supporting a contract proposal that would put an end to the strike and get the miners back to work. BlackRock has said it believes in “sustainable investing,” which the firm defines as “investing in progress.” "
business,"UMWA President Cecil Roberts said in a statement that the miners were “simply following the money, and demanding that those who created that wealth, the miners, get their fair share of it.”"
business,"Unlike the thermal coal used for power, Warrior Met produces coking or metallurgical coal (sometimes just called met coal), which is used to make steel. The company calls itself “the leading producer and exporter of metallurgical coal for the global steel industry,” sending coal to Europe, Asia and South America. "
business,"Among those who made the journey north was Argo’s friend Chris Burke, who’d never been to New York City before. He started working at Warrior Met four years ago. He said the contract that came out of bankruptcy is “one of the worst ones around” for mines in the area. The company’s new offer was so subpar, he said, that the decision to strike was an easy one. "
business,"“They’re taking advantage of us,” said Burke, who has two kids. “It’s the same coal as the neighbor mine up the road. … It’s all met coal. But it’s the lowest paid. We just want to make it equal.”"
business,A Warrior Met spokesperson said the company was “committed” to reaching a deal with the union and had offered some increases in pay and benefits during negotiations.
business,"Phil Smith, a spokesperson for the union, said the company and union officials were back at the bargaining table this week but remained far apart on most of the key issues. Union members overwhelmingly voted down a contract offer made in April."
business,"“We have and will continue to work with the UMWA to reach a fair and reasonable contract that provides our employees with a competitive package while protecting jobs and ensuring the longevity of the Company,” the spokesperson said in an email to HuffPost."
business,"Union members said they used to pay almost nothing for health care coverage, but after the bankruptcy they started paying a $1,500 deductible and a 20% copay. The low insurance costs they enjoyed under previous contracts may seem unusually generous, but not for unionized coal mines. Mining comes with so many safety hazards and long-term health risks that members have poured much of their leverage into negotiating low health costs."
business,"Many workers said the loss of premium pay has been a greater financial hit. Under the law, they are still eligible for time-and-a-half pay after working 40 hours in a week, but the extra pay used to kick in after eight hours each day under the old contract, Smith said. "
business,"Emanuel Barnfield, a 13-year veteran at the mine and father of three, said many workers could previously top $100,000 a year by working long hours. They may still work the same bruising schedules, he said, but now they bring home $20,000 or $30,000 less. While the pay might still seem high to outsiders, Barnfield said the job takes a harsh toll on one’s body and family life."
business,"“We’re nothing but money to these guys,” he said of the company and its shareholders."
business,"Warrior Met said its offer to the union includes a 10% to 12% pay bump for workers, along with additional time off and a “relaxed” attendance policy, although the company did not provide details. Several workers in interviews criticized what they called the company’s “four strikes” attendance policy that could lead to termination, saying it didn’t allow leniency for absences due to health problems or emergencies. "
business,"Tefere Gebre, executive vice president of the AFL-CIO labor federation, said he sees the Warrior Met strike as a continuation of the walkouts that began with West Virginia teachers in 2018."
business,"“Billionaires are shooting themselves into space while mine workers are saying, ‘How am I going to feed my kids?’” Gebre said. “These are people who can least afford to be out on strike for more than 100 days.”"
business,"The strike affects two separate mines as well as a preparation plant and a mechanical shop at Warrior Met. The union said roughly 60 members of the bargaining unit have crossed the picket line to continue working, while the company has also brought in outside contractors as replacements."
business,"The union has maintained picket lines at a series of sites outside mine property. Warrior Met obtained an injunction limiting how many strikers and supporters can be at each site, so that workers can still easily get on company property. The picket lines can be tense and downright dangerous. The union said it’s counted at least four instances in which drivers heading onto mine property struck picketers. It has released video showing two of those incidents, calling them “company-inspired violence.”"
business,"Amy Pilkteron, whose husband, Greg, works at the mine, said she was struck by a car and spun around while on a picket line July 8, leaving her right side bruised. She said her back is still “out of whack” and she’s been visiting a chiropractor."
business,"“I’m just thankful I wasn’t a couple of steps back, because then he would have hit me full force,” Pilkteron said."
business,"Haeden Wright, a schoolteacher serving as the auxiliary’s president, said it takes an enormous amount of effort to sustain a strike for four months. Her husband, Braxton, is a Warrior Met miner, and her father worked at the mine under its previous ownership."
business,The company spokesperson said that ​​“Warrior Met Coal does not condone any acts of violence.”
business,Strikers have been receiving $700 every two weeks from the union’s strike fund. The drop in income has left many people relying on an auxiliary powered by miners’ wives. They’ve been bringing in donations and putting together free grocery bags and back-to-school supplies for families.
business,"“What people don’t understand is to have a successful strike that can last this long, it’s a whole lot more than just picket lines,” Wright said. “You have to have people who support you. It’s mutual aid.”"
business,"A lot of strikers have taken on second jobs to support their families during the strike, working on days they aren’t picketing. Barnfield has been driving a tow truck for one of his friends to make ends meet. Argo has been cutting grass on the side."
business,"Burke said he assumed the strike would last a couple of months, not as long as it has. Still, he hasn’t taken on any new work. "
business,"“I live on the picket line,” he said. "
business,"NEW YORK (AP) — Resurgent pandemic worries knocked stocks lower from Wall Street to Tokyo on Monday, fueled by fears that faster-spreading variants of the virus may upend the economy’s strong recovery."
business,"The S&P 500 fell 68.67, or 1.6%, to 4,258.49, after setting a record just a week earlier. In another sign of worry, the yield on the 10-year Treasury touched its lowest level in five months as investors scrambled for safer places to put their money."
business,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average slumped 725.81, or 2.1%, to 33,962.04, while the Nasdaq composite lost 152.25, or 1.1%, to 14,274.98."
business,"Airlines and stocks of other companies that would get hurt the most by potential COVID-19 restrictions took some of the heaviest losses, similar to the early days of the pandemic in February and March 2020. United Airlines lost 5.5%, mall owner Simon Property Group gave up 5.9%, and cruise operator Carnival fell 5.7%."
business,"The drop also circled the world, with several European markets sinking roughly 2.5% and Asian indexes down a bit less. The price of benchmark U.S. crude, meanwhile, fell more than 7% after OPEC and allied nations agreed on Sunday to eventually allow for higher oil production this year."
business,"Increased worries about the virusmay seem strange to people in parts of the world where masks are coming off, or already have, thanks to COVID-19 vaccinations. But the World Health Organization says cases and deaths are climbing globally after a period of decline, spurred by the highly contagious delta variant. And given how tightly connected the global economy is, a hit anywhere can quickly affect others on the other side of the world."
business,"Across the country, the daily number of COVID cases has soared by nearly 20,000 over the last two weeks to about 32,000. The vaccine campaign has hit a wall, with the average number of daily inoculations sinking to the lowest levels since January, and cases are on the rise in all 50 states."
business,"Even in the U.S., where the vaccination rate is higher than in many other countries, people in Los Angeles County must once again wear masks indoors regardless of whether they’re vaccinated following spikes in cases, hospitalizations and deaths."
business,"That’s why markets are concerned, even though reports show the economy is still recovering at a fantastically high rate and the general expectation is for it to deliver continued growth. Any worsening of virus trends threatens the high prices that stocks have achieved on expectations the economy will fulfill those lofty forecasts."
business,"Financial markets have been showing signs of increased concerns for a while, but the U.S. stock market had remained largely resilient. The S&P 500 has had just two down weeks in the last eight, and the last time it had even a 5% pullback from a record high was in October."
business,Several analysts pointed to that backdrop of high prices and very calm movements for weeks while dissecting Monday’s drop.
business,"“It’s a bit of an overreaction, but when you have a market that’s at record highs, that’s had the kind of run we’ve had, with virtually no pullback, it becomes extremely vulnerable to any sort of bad news,” said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading & derivatives at Charles Schwab. “It was just a matter of what that tipping point was, and it seems we finally reached that this morning” with worries about the delta variant."
business,He and other analysts are optimistic stocks can rebound quickly. Investors have been trained recently to see every dip in stocks as merely an opportunity to buy low.
business,"“The valuations, they just got too frothy,” he said. “There was just so much optimism out there.”"
business,"Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, was more pessimistic. He says the stock market may be in the early stages for a drop of as much as 10% following its big run higher in prices. The S&P 500 nearly doubled after hitting its bottom in March 2020."
business,"The bond market has been louder and more persistent in its warnings. The yield on the 10-year Treasury tends to move with expectations for economic growth and for inflation, and it has been sinking since late March, when it was at roughly 1.75%. It fell to 1.20% Monday from 1.29% late Friday."
business,"Analysts and professional investors say a long list of potential reasons is behind the sharp moves in the bond market, which is seen as more rational and sober than the stock market. But at the heart is the risk the economy may be set to slow sharply from its current, extremely high growth."
business,"Besides the new variants of the coronavirus, other risks to the economy include fading pandemic relief efforts from the U.S. government and a Federal Reserve that looks set to begin paring back its assistance for markets later this year."
business,"Monday’s selling pressure was widespread, with nearly 90% of the stocks in the S&P 500 lower. Even Big Tech stocks fell, with Apple down 2.7% and Microsoft 1.3% lower. Such stocks seemed nearly immune to virus fears during earlier downturns, rising with expectations for continued growth almost regardless of the economy’s strength."
business,"Across the S&P 500, analysts are forecasting profit growth of nearly 70% for the second quarter from a year earlier. That would be the strongest growth since 2009, when the economy was climbing out of the Great Recession."
business,"But just like worries are rising that the economy’s growth has already peaked, analysts are trying to handicap by how much growth rates will slow in upcoming quarters and years for corporate profits."
business,AP Business Writer Yuri Kageyama contributed.
business,"NEW YORK (AP) — As COVID-19 ravaged the world last year, CEOs’ big pay packages seemed to be under as much threat as everything else."
business,"Fortunately for those CEOs, many had boards of directors willing to see the pandemic as an extraordinary event beyond their control. Across the country, boards made changes to the intricate formulas that determine their CEOs’ pay — and other moves — that helped make up for losses created by the crisis."
business,"At Advance Auto Parts, CEO Tom Greco’s pay for 2020 was in line to take a hit because of a mountain of pandemic-related costs. Extended sick-pay benefits and expenses for hand sanitizer and other safety equipment totaling $60 million dragged on two key measurements that help set his performance pay. But because the board’s compensation committee saw these costs as extraordinary and unanticipated, it excluded them from its calculations. That helped Greco’s total compensation rise 4.7% last year to $8.1 million."
business,"As a result, pay packages rose yet again last year for the CEOs of the biggest companies, even though the pandemic sent the economy to its worst quarter on record and slashed corporate profits around the world. The median pay package for a CEO at an S&P 500 company hit $12.7 million in 2020, according to data analyzed by Equilar for The Associated Press. That means half the CEOs in the survey made more, and half made less. It’s 5% more than the median pay for that same group of CEOs in 2019 and an acceleration from the 4.1% climb in last year’s survey."
business,"Meanwhile, regular workers also saw gains, but not at the same rate as their bosses. And millions of others lost their jobs."
business,"At Carnival, the cruise operator gave stock grants to executives, in part to encourage its leaders to stick with the company as the pandemic forced it to halt sailings and furlough workers. For CEO Arnold Donald’s 2020 compensation, those grants were valued at $5.2 million, though their full value will ultimately depend on how the company performs on carbon reductions and other measures in coming years. That helped Donald receive total compensation valued at $13.3 million for the year, up 19% from a year earlier, even as Carnival swung to a $10.2 billion loss for the fiscal year."
business,Wages and benefits for all workers outside the government rose just 2.6% last year. That’s according to U.S. government data that ignore the effect of workers shifting between different industries. It’s an important distinction because more lower-wage earners lost their jobs as the economy shut down than professionals who could work from home.
business,COMPLEXITY AND CORONAVIRUS
business,"The AP’s compensation study included pay data for CEOs at S&P 500 companies who have served at least two full fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30. It doesn’t include some highly paid CEOs who don’t fit that criteria. The pay figures for CEOs sometimes include grants of stock and options they may never ultimately receive unless they hit certain performance targets."
business,"“This should have been a year for shared sacrifice,” said Sarah Anderson, who directs the global economy project at the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies. “Instead it became a year of shielding CEOs from risk while it was the frontline employees who paid the price.”"
business,"Last year’s 5% gain for median CEO pay masks how much variation in pay there was beneath the surface. Some companies thrived as a direct result of the pandemic. Sales boomed for Lowe’s amid a great nesting across the country, and CEO Marvin Ellison’s pay nearly doubled after its stock more than doubled the S&P 500′s total return through its fiscal year."
business,"Overall, 61% of the 342 CEOs in this year’s survey did get a boost in compensation last year. That’s almost the exact same percentage as the 62% in 2019, when the economy and corporate profits were growing."
business,"Other CEOs, meanwhile, saw their compensation cut. At Duke Energy, the board reduced CEO Lynn Good’s short-term performance pay after its earnings per share fell short of its initial target, partly because industrial customers used less power during the pandemic. Good’s pay dipped 2.6% to $14.3 million, even though earnings ended up within the range Duke forecast for Wall Street early in the year. Duke didn’t adjust formulas to raise Good’s pay because of the pandemic."
business,That’s also despite several CEOs taking high-profile cuts to their salary during the year as an act of shared sacrifice and to conserve a bit of cash for the company. Roughly one of every five CEOs in this year’s survey had a smaller salary for 2020 than the year before.
business,"But salary is often just a minor piece of a CEO’s total compensation, which is derived from notoriously complex formulas. Each year, companies fill pages of their proxy statements with charts and footnotes showing how the bulk of their CEO’s pay rises and falls with corporate performance. It’s here, in the nuanced area, where many companies adjusted levers that ultimately helped CEOs get more in compensation."
business,A SUDDEN CHANGE
business,"Boards typically stick with the formulas set for CEO pay early each year, but the global economy’s sudden crash forced a reconsideration. What made things even cloudier was that they had few historical guides for how to proceed."
business,"“Many committees asked us this very question: Does this compare to the financial crisis? What did people do then?” said Melissa Burek, partner at Compensation Advisory Partners, a consulting firm that works with boards."
business,"At Carnival, for example, the company says that much of its CEO’s compensation is tied to the company’s financial and operational performance. The company said Donald received no cash bonus tied to 2020. And to preserve cash in the pandemic, the company gave him grants of restricted stock instead of salary from April through June. Then from July through November, it cut Donald’s salary by half."
business,"But the pandemic was very different than the 2008 economic collapse, mainly because this crisis was caused by a virus, rather than by CEOs taking on too much debt and risk. As boards adjusted targets to make CEOs’ incentive pay less difficult to get, many also limited the size of the possible payouts."
business,"“I think there is a recognition, when unemployment is so high, of: Do we feel good about paying our CEO at this level?” said Kelly Malafis, also a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners, of the thinking by boards of directors. “The answer is: ‘We’re doing this for performance. When performance is not good, we don’t pay. When performance is good, we do pay.’”"
business,RATTLING AT THE GATES
business,One bill in Congress proposes to raise taxes on corporations where the CEO makes 50 times or more than the median worker at the company.
business,"Companies have to show how much more their CEO makes than their typical worker, and the median in this year’s survey was 172 times. That’s up from 167 times for those same CEOs last year, and it means employees must work lifetimes to make what their CEO does in just a year."
business,Progressives in Washington are pushing for rules changes to narrow the gap between CEOs and workers.
business,"At some companies, shareholders are pushing back on compensation packages approved by the board."
business,"Chipotle’s board excluded three months of sales results from the worst of the pandemic, along with several other items, while calculating pay for its CEO, Brian Niccol. That allowed him to get bigger compensation than he would have otherwise."
business,"At the annual meeting of Chipotle Mexican Grill’s shareholders earlier this month, just 51% of voting shares gave a thumb’s up to its executives’ pay packages, compared with 95% a year earlier. Across the S&P 500, such “Say-on-pay” votes routinely get more than 90% approval."
business,"The trend didn’t hold last year, when the pandemic may have unsettled everything, but Morgan Stanley strategists say they still see failed “Say-on-pay” votes as a red flag that a stock may struggle."
business,"While they’re nonbinding, “Say-on-pay” votes are getting increasing attention from Wall Street. Between 2017 and 2019, stocks of companies that failed their votes lagged sharply behind the S&P 500 in the following 12 months, according to Morgan Stanley."
business,"Chipotle called the move a one-time modification that’s not reflective of Niccol’s ongoing pay package. Chipotle was one of the relative winners of the pandemic, with revenue rising 7.1% and its stock soaring 65.7%."
business,"And if there’s anything that investors on Wall Street care about, it’s how well they’re getting compensated."
business,"A self-described socially conscious vegan food manufacturer laid off its entire production staff in North Carolina on Friday, infuriating workers who said the lack of notice and severance pay was out of step with the company’s stated values."
business,Audio of the layoff announcement at No Evil Foods provided to HuffPost by a source captured stunned workers shouting back at company leaders who delivered the news.
business,"“So we get fired so you can stay alive?” one worker said to the company’s chief executive, Mike Woliansky, as Woliansky explained that the facility will be shut down."
business,"Several workers reacted with disbelief after the company’s human resources chief, Drew Pollick, explained they would be paid for Friday’s work but nothing beyond that because “we’re out of money.”"
business,Workers were heard yelling “screw all of y’all” and ”Fuck you!”
business,"“You can’t tell me there’s absolutely no money,” one said."
business,"No Evil Foods, which is based in Weaverville, north of Asheville, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday."
business,"Woliansky said in the meeting that No Evil Foods was counting on a new infusion of cash that recently fell through. He said the pandemic presented a number of challenges for the company, and that leaders had decided to move to a co-manufacturing model, rather than have its own dedicated facility. "
business,"“They got a better deal ― the ones that fucked up,” added one worker, in apparent reference to the company’s leadership. "
business,"“The reality of the situation is the company has essentially run out of money, and we’re now really forced to make some really big, really difficult changes,” he said in the audio obtained by HuffPost. “It’s coming down to whether or not there will be a No Evil at all.”"
business,"Mike Rapier, one of the workers who spoke up during the meeting, said in an interview with HuffPost that the company’s leaders deserved all the backtalk. No Evil Foods describes itself as a purpose-driven food manufacturer, seeking to address “food insecurity, economic justice, and climate change” through plant-based options. Some of its products make cheeky nods to socialism, like the chicken-free Comrade Cluck."
business,"“We would have big monthly meetings about core values and family and respect and save-the-world,” said Rapier, who added that he did not make the audio recording. “They preached all of this stuff, but then when it came down to it … they were very, very cutthroat.”"
business,"Rapier said company leaders often spoke about the workforce as a family. That’s why Rapier, a production employee, expected more than a recommendation letter and a leaflet about an upcoming job fair."
business,"This is not the first time workers have accused No Evil Foods of not meeting its socially conscious image. The company pushed back hard against a union drive last year, holding captive-audience meetings and urging workers to vote down the effort with the United Food and Commercial Workers union. When audio of those meetings were posted to the internet, the company made legal efforts to have them removed. "
business,"Rapier estimated that there were between 30 and 50 workers laid off on Friday, though he said others had been let go earlier in the year. The layoffs were first reported by Insider."
business,"Companies generally are not required to provide severance pay unless a contract requires it. Sometimes employers are required to give 60 days notice or more under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act or similar state laws, but the mass layoff at No Evil Foods appears to be small enough so that the law does not apply."
business,"Rapier said he really enjoyed working at No Evil Foods. He eats meat and didn’t buy into the plant-based-foods mission of the company, but he considered it a solid job and liked his co-workers. He left Ace Hardware a year ago to work at No Evil Foods."
business,"The company fired two workers involved in the organizing effort, claiming they had violated the facility’s social-distancing rules. The two workers, Jon Reynolds and Cortne Roche, accused the company of illegal retaliation, and the National Labor Relations Board’s general counsel pursued a complaint. As Jacobin recently reported, No Evil Foods settled those claims by paying $20,000 to Reynolds and $22,500 to Roche."
business,"According to Rapier, the company had recently invested in equipment that did not suit its production well, leading to frequent shutdowns. He said he had a feeling business was not going well. Still, Rapier said, given the mission of No Evil Foods, he assumed the company would try to give workers a softer landing."
business,"“They talked the talk but they didn’t walk the walk with regard to their philosophy. They just dumped us,” he said. “This kind of upheaval is not right, the way they went about this.”"
business,"Rapier, 59, said his health insurance through No Evil Foods ended immediately Friday, and he isn’t sure if he’ll be able to find coverage he can afford. As for his next work plans, Rapier said he plans to go to that job fair."

business,"“Our systems are coming back online and we are not sparing any resources to fight this threat,” Andre Nogueira, CEO of JBS USA, said in a statement."
business,Brazil’s JBS SA said late Tuesday that it had made “significant progress” in dealing with the cyberattack and expected the “vast majority” of its plants to be operating on Wednesday.
business,"JBS is the second-largest producer of beef, pork and chicken in the U.S. If it were to shut down for even one day, the U.S. would lose almost a quarter of its beef-processing capacity, or the equivalent of 20,000 beef cows, according to Trey Malone, an assistant professor of agriculture at Michigan State University."
business,"The closures reflect the reality that modern meat processing plants are heavily automated, for both food- and worker-safety reasons. Computers collect data at multiple stages of the production process, and orders, billing, shipping and other functions are all electronic."
business,"JBS, which has not stated publicly that the attack was ransomware, said the cyberattack affected servers supporting its operations in North America and Australia. Backup servers weren’t affected and it said it was not aware of any customer, supplier or employee data being compromised."
business,"JBS plants in Australia resumed limited operations as of Wednesday in New South Wales and Victoria states, Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said. The company hoped to resume work in Queensland state on Thursday, he said."
business,"JBS is the largest meat and food processing company in Australia, with 47 facilities including abattoirs, feedlots and meat processing sites."
business,Littleproud said his department and Australian law enforcement officials were due to meet with their counterparts in the U.S. on Wednesday.
business,"Even before the attack, U.S. meat prices were rising due to coronavirus shutdowns, bad weather and high plant absenteeism. Malone said the disruption could further raise meat prices ahead of summer barbecues. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates beef prices will climb 1%-2% this year, poultry as much as 1.5% and pork 2%-3%."
business,"JBS, which is a majority shareholder of Pilgrim’s Pride, didn’t say which of its 84 U.S. facilities were closed Monday and Tuesday because of the attack. It said JBS USA and Pilgrim’s were able to ship meat from nearly all of its facilities Tuesday. The company also said it was making progress toward resuming plant operations in the U.S. and Australia. Several of the company’s pork, poultry and prepared foods plants were operational Tuesday and its Canada beef facility resumed production, it said."
business,"Earlier Tuesday, a union official confirmed that two shifts at the company’s largest U.S. beef plant, in Greeley, Colorado, were canceled. Some plant shifts in Canada were also canceled Monday and Tuesday, according to JBS Facebook posts."
business,"Jean-Pierre said the White House “is engaging directly with the Russian government on this matter and delivering the message that responsible states do not harbor ransomware criminals.” The FBI is investigating the incident, and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is offering technical support to JBS."

business,"Ransomware expert Brett Callow, a threat analyst at the security firm Emsisoft, said companies like JBS make ideal targets."
business,"Mark Jordan, who follows the meat industry as the executive director of Leap Market Analytics, said the disruption would be minimal if JBS recovers in the next few days. Meat processers are accustomed to delays because of various factors including industrial accidents and power outages. They make up for lost production with extra shifts, he said."
business,"“Several plants owned by a major meatpacker going offline for a couple of days is a major headache, but it is manageable assuming it doesn’t extend much beyond that,” he said."
business,"“A lot of organizations aren’t able to find and fix different vulnerabilities faster than the adversaries that they’re fighting,” Crabtree said."
business,"But such attacks can wreak havoc. Last month, a gang of hackers shut down operation of the Colonial Pipeline, the largest U.S. fuel pipeline, for nearly a week. The closure sparked long lines and panic buying at gas stations across the Southeast. Colonial Pipeline confirmed it paid $4.4 million to the hackers."
business,U.S. meat demand generally eases for a few weeks between Memorial Day and the July 4 Independence Day holiday.

The era of the Victoria’s Secret Angels is officially over: The lingerie company announced this week that it is overhauling its branding going forward and partnering with celebrities like Priyanka Chopra and Megan Rapinoe.
As The New York Times first reported, the brand is bringing in a group of seven women, including Chopra and Rapinoe, to be part of the VS Collective. The women “will alternately advise the brand, appear in ads and promote Victoria’s Secret on Instagram.” The company also has “an entirely new executive team and is forming a board of directors in which all but one seat will be occupied by women.”
A press release for the Collective said that “through social, cultural and business relationships,” the group “will work to create new associate programs, revolutionary product collections, compelling and inspiring content, and rally support for causes vital to women.”
The VS Collective will also include skier Eileen Gu, model and body positivity advocate Paloma Elsesser, trans model Valentina Sampaio, model and South Sudanese refugee Adut Akech, and photographer and founder of #Girlgaze, a digital platform for female photographers, Amanda de Cadenet.
The Times called the end of the Victoria’s Secret Angels “the most extreme and unabashed attempt at a brand turnaround in recent memory,” since the company was notorious for selling overtly sexy merchandise modeled on women with impossibly perfect bodies.
News of the change came after the company canceled its iconic — and controversial — fashion show in 2019 after consumers and advocates had for years asked the company to increase its size offerings and to showcase more body diversity on the runway.
Martin Waters, the former head of Victoria’s Secret’s international business who was appointed chief executive of the brand in February, told the Times: “When the world was changing, we were too slow to respond. We needed to stop being about what men want and to be about what women want.”
Response to the news has been mixed. Many conservative voices criticized the brand’s decision to align itself with outspoken feminists like Rapinoe and, while some women’s advocates praised the decision, others were skeptical about the brand’s motives and whether it could be successful."
business,"
In addition to its refusal to update its retrograde branding for years, Victoria’s Secret is no stranger to controversy. Scandals related to the brand owner’s ties to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and complaints of toxicity within the company have circled for years.
A 2020 New York Times report detailed Victoria’s Secret’s history of “misogyny, bullying and harassment, according to interviews with more than 30 current and former executives, employees, contractors and models, as well as court filings and other documents.”
In response, more than 100 models signed an open letter to then-Victoria’s Secret CEO John Mehas asking him to take action.
“We believe that this moment can be a wake-up call for Victoria’s Secret,” the letter read.

business,"Chris Smalls made a lot of friends in his first year working at an Amazon warehouse in 2015. But within a matter of months, most of them were gone."
business,"“That’s the name of Amazon’s game: Hire and fire,” said Smalls, 32. “They know that people don’t want to be here long, that these jobs break you down physically and mentally.”"
business,"Smalls would know better than most. Amazon terminated him last March after he led a walkout at his Staten Island, New York, warehouse over safety concerns. Now Smalls has started an independent effort to organize a union at that facility, battling the same force he saw from the inside: Amazon’s high turnover rate."
business,"“It’s definitely one way to avoid a union,” he said."
business,"After successfully beating back a union drive at its Alabama warehouse in April, the world’s largest online retailer is facing a wave of worker activism in the U.S. and abroad. Both established labor unions and other worker groups are trying to organize employees inside Amazon’s ever-growing network of fulfillment centers and delivery hubs. "
business,"The Seattle Times conducted its own analysis of Amazon’s workforce data last year, putting the company’s turnover at 111% during the pandemic. A New York Times investigation published this week put the figure even higher, at 150%, showing that Amazon was shedding 3% of its workers every week before the pandemic began."
business,"But whatever strategies the organizers deploy, they must contend with the company’s intimidating churn rate. "
business,That has huge implications for organizing. 
business,"A turnover rate above 100% doesn’t mean every single worker quits or gets fired in a year: It means the number of workers who leave is greater than the average number of workers employed during the same time period. So while some workers may last years, others last days. Under a turnover rate of 100%, every theoretical position inside the warehouse would turn over once in a year, on average."
business,"Amazon does not release data on the turnover in its warehouses and declined to do so for this story. But the observations of workers like Smalls square with a 2020 analysis from the National Employment Law Project, which found that the turnover rate in the local warehouse industry increases significantly when Amazon comes to town. Warehouse churn more than doubled in several California counties after Amazon facilities opened, averaging more than 100%."
business,"Before the National Labor Relations Board schedules an election, a union must secure signed union authorization cards from at least 30% of the workers in an expected bargaining unit. In reality, a union wants far more than that ― ideally two-thirds or greater ― since they will need to win a majority of votes cast, and the employer may launch an anti-union campaign that weakens support. "
business,"‘It Is By Design’
"
business,"At an Amazon warehouse, high turnover means a union would be losing cards every day as workers leave and new employees unfamiliar with the campaign replace them. Even if the union manages to win an election, high turnover could hurt its position at the bargaining table if some of the most active organizers have quit or been fired. And churn could even help the employer purge the union from the facility by convincing newer workers to decertify it."
business,"“It’s a big commitment for a worker to decide to start organizing with their coworkers,” said Irene Tung, who co-authored the NELP report. “And it may take years before they see a first contract.”"
business,"Gene Bruskin, a longtime labor organizer, said Amazon’s turnover also creates basic logistical hurdles as workers try to establish networks. Bruskin is in regular touch with Amazon workers who are trying to organize their warehouses. "
business,"High turnover has bedeviled unions for as long they’ve been organizing U.S. workers, but the vastness of Amazon’s workforce presents extreme challenges. "
business,"On a more fundamental level, high turnover makes it harder to build solidarity. Those who come to see the warehouse as just a place to get a paycheck for a few months would feel less invested in the job, or a campaign to improve it. Workers who barely know one another would be less likely to trust each other or take risks together. "
business,"“A ‘long time’ there in Amazon is people who’ve been there more than a couple years,” Bruskin said."
business,"“When you’re trying to build a committee and sort of track leadership, map the place out and figure out where your good connections are, you just can’t count on that,” Bruskin said. “The best you can do, knowing that you’re going to lose a lot of folks, is to try and create a culture of solidarity and activity … so that when somebody [new] comes in they sort of pick up the vibe. You just can’t be as dependent on a particular group of people.”"
business,Bruskin said one worker he knows recently lost a longtime organizing ally when he quit Amazon. She was devastated by his departure because he had so much Amazon experience relative to other workers.
business,"Joseph McCartin, a historian and director of Georgetown University’s Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor, said industrial titans a century ago were concerned about the toll turnover was taking on their operations. He said it was a prime motivator behind Henry Ford’s famous $5-a-day compact with workers, which increased wages significantly in 1914. According to McCartin, lower turnover eventually helped foment the pre-World War II union organizing boom, since it helped stabilize workers within their industries."
business,"The turnover in Amazon warehouses stems partly from the seasonal nature of the business. Amazon fills its greatest share of orders in the runup to the holidays, during the period known as “peak.” The company staffs up accordingly, then drops workers as post-peak volume dictates. "
business,"“For the past 20 years or so we’ve had more and more employers who’ve gone full circle to the model that used to exist at the turn of the last century ― the model that people like Henry Ford started to break from, [the idea] that turnover actually works for us,” McCartin said."
business,"But in recent years, McCartin said management philosophy at many companies has moved in the other direction, as employers wield turnover to better control the workforce. Amazon, he said, may exemplify that calculation."
business,"One worker at a fulfillment center in the Midwest, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said a lot of workers at their facility end up quitting because of inattentive managers and unreasonable expectations. It seems that relatively few workers who opened the facility several years ago remain on the job. The worker said their facility seems to lose as many “pickers” a week as it can manage to bring on board."
business,"Amazon openly encourages some of the turnover, offering employees annual buyouts to leave the company if they believe Amazon isn’t right for them. Under the pay-to-quit program, workers with a year under their belts are eligible for $2,000 or more to leave under the condition they can never return. "
business,"Nelson Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said modern employers like Amazon can mitigate the traditional expenses of turnover thanks to technology that cuts down on the costs of training. Amazon workers, after all, are largely managed by algorithms."
business,"But the turnover is also part of the company’s founding ethos. According to the recent Times report, Amazon founder and outgoing CEO Jeff Bezos believed a long-tenured workforce amounted to a “march to mediocrity,” and preferred that the hourly labor at the company’s foundation be done on a short-term basis."
business,"Turnover can be expensive for employers, since they have to constantly hire and train new workers who, for at least a period, will be less productive than the ones leaving. But labor experts say a company of Amazon’s size and sophistication would not have high churn if it didn’t prefer it that way."
business,"“It is by design,” Lichtenstein said. “They do want turnover. They don’t talk about it, but they want it.”"
business,‘Exploiting It On A Larger Scale’
business,"Amazon’s high turnover shaped some of the most critical decisions made by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union in their unsuccessful effort to unionize an Amazon facility in Bessemer, Alabama, earlier this year. "
business,"The union assumed they were losing at least 60 cards per week — and perhaps many more — due to turnover among the workforce of nearly 6,000. That was one reason they did not resist Amazon’s effort at the NLRB to greatly expand the bargaining unit, even though it would disadvantage the union: They worried that if litigation delayed the election then turnover would naturally whittle their support. "
business,"As the lead organizer told HuffPost at the time, “You’ll never deep-organize a workplace that has 100% turnover. You’ll just chase your tail.” "
business,"“These new people came into a building full of [Amazon] banners,” said the worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she supported the union effort. “I’m sure they had an orientation that told them how great Amazon was.”"
business,"Workers ultimately rejected unionization by a lopsided count of 1,798 to 738, with many voters saying they did not see a need for a union there. (There were an additional 505 challenged ballots that went unopened and may have favored the RWDSU.)"
business,The Bessemer facility had been open for less than a year and one worker recalled seeing an influx of hires in the runup to the vote. The addition of new workers would have helped diffuse union support inside the facility and put more work on organizers’ plates.
business,"The Teamsters have gone public with an effort to unionize Amazon’s workforce, but the union said it is not beholden to going the traditional NLRB route of gathering signed cards and petitioning the labor board for an election. A Teamsters local that’s organizing in Iowa has already said it is considering recognition strikes, where workers not yet formally unionized would carry out work stoppages in an effort to pressure the company into bargaining."
business,"The high turnover raises questions about whether traditional union elections are worth pursuing at Amazon warehouses, especially when the company has shown its willingness to invest heavily in anti-union campaigns. In many cases, Amazon’s lawyering could delay a union election long enough that turnover would erode union support and essentially take care of the problem."
business,"Randy Korgan, national director of the Teamsters’ Amazon campaign, said it’s important to view the company’s high turnover in the broader context of the warehouse industry. Working conditions in the field were deteriorating well before Amazon’s era of dominance, Korgan said, pointing to the use of temporary workers in facilities operated by companies like Walmart, especially in major logistics hubs like California’s Inland Empire."
business,"Amazon, he maintains, is accelerating a downward trend."
business,"“Those of us who have been in the living rooms of these workers for 30 years, we’ve seen the transition happen,” Korgan said. “Amazon is just exploiting it on a larger scale.”"
business,"“The NLRB is one strategy. Recognition strikes are another,” he said. “It’s getting workers to understand the influence they have, and what the pathways are after that.”"
business,"Korgan said labor organizers can manage 100% turnover at a facility that employs a couple hundred people, but in a workplace teeming with thousands, “the math is the math.” That’s why the union is keeping different approaches on the table. "
business,"“We are seeing new faces,” Smalls said. “We’re trying to catch them before they even start.”"
business,"When Amazon fired Smalls following his walkout last year, the company accused him of violating the facility’s safety rules. Vice later reported that Amazon officials, facing a public-relations mess, hatched a plan to malign Smalls as “not smart or articulate.”"
business,"Smalls said he’s managed to bring aboard some workers with fairly long tenures at the warehouse. He believes a lot of those workers are more interested in unionizing because they’ve had more time to understand how Amazon operates. Yet each day seems to bring more fresh hires whom Smalls encounters for the first time, underlining the daunting challenge."
business,"Smalls has created a new, independent union in his long-shot bid to organize the Staten Island facility, called the Amazon Labor Union. Working without the resources of an established union, he and a handful of fellow organizers have been posted outside the warehouse to catch workers as they come and go from their shifts. They have been gathering union cards and Smalls hopes they will someday be able to file for an election with the NLRB."
business,"Some Amazon workers have been organizing under the banner of Amazonians United, which started in Chicago. The group has openly eschewed the NLRB process and appears focused instead on building militant minorities willing to carry out job actions, such as walkouts over safety issues. As one member put it, “For us, success isn’t dependent upon a union election.”"

business,"In 2007, Jeff Bezos, then a multibillionaire and now the world’s richest man, did not pay a penny in federal income taxes. He achieved the feat again in 2011. In 2018, Tesla founder Elon Musk, the second-richest person in the world, also paid no federal income taxes."
business,Michael Bloomberg managed to do the same in recent years. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn did it twice. George Soros paid no federal income tax three years in a row.
business,But many workers quit or get fired because they can’t keep up with Amazon’s pace. The company tracks workers’ productivity through scanners and enforces a time-off-task policy that dings them for time away from their duties. (Amazon recently tweaked that controversial policy in a way the company said would make it less punitive.) Plenty of others likely leave because they get hurt.
business,"ProPublica has obtained a vast trove of Internal Revenue Service data on the tax returns of thousands of the nation’s wealthiest people, covering more than 15 years. The data provides an unprecedented look inside the financial lives of America’s titans, including Warren Buffett, Bill Gates, Rupert Murdoch and Mark Zuckerberg. It shows not just their income and taxes, but also their investments, stock trades, gambling winnings and even the results of audits."
business,"Many Americans live paycheck to paycheck, amassing little wealth and paying the federal government a percentage of their income that rises if they earn more. In recent years, the median American household earned about $70,000 annually and paid 14% in federal taxes. The highest income tax rate, 37%, kicked in this year, for couples, on earnings above $628,300."
business,"Taken together, it demolishes the cornerstone myth of the American tax system: that everyone pays their fair share and the richest Americans pay the most. The IRS records show that the wealthiest can — perfectly legally — pay income taxes that are only a tiny fraction of the hundreds of millions, if not billions, their fortunes grow each year."
business,The confidential tax records obtained by ProPublica show that the ultrarich effectively sidestep this system.
business,"America’s billionaires avail themselves of tax-avoidance strategies beyond the reach of ordinary people. Their wealth derives from the skyrocketing value of their assets, like stock and property. Those gains are not defined by U.S. laws as taxable income unless and until the billionaires sell."
business,"To capture the financial reality of the richest Americans, ProPublica undertook an analysis that has never been done before. We compared how much in taxes the 25 richest Americans paid each year to how much Forbes estimated their wealth grew in that same time period."
business,We’re going to call this their true tax rate.
business,"The results are stark. According to Forbes, those 25 people saw their worth rise a collective $401 billion from 2014 to 2018. They paid a total of $13.6 billion in federal income taxes in those five years, the IRS data shows. That’s a staggering sum, but it amounts to a true tax rate of only 3.4%."
business,"No one among the 25 wealthiest avoided as much tax as Buffett, the grandfatherly centibillionaire. That’s perhaps surprising, given his public stance as an advocate of higher taxes for the rich. According to Forbes, his riches rose $24.3 billion between 2014 and 2018. Over those years, the data shows, Buffett reported paying $23.7 million in taxes."
business,"It’s a completely different picture for middle-class Americans, for example, wage earners in their early 40s who have amassed a typical amount of wealth for people their age. From 2014 to 2018, such households saw their net worth expand by about $65,000 after taxes on average, mostly due to the rise in value of their homes. But because the vast bulk of their earnings were salaries, their tax bills were almost as much, nearly $62,000, over that five-year period."
business,"That works out to a true tax rate of 0.1%, or less than 10 cents for every $100 he added to his wealth."
business,"Experts have long understood the broad outlines of how little the wealthy are taxed in the United States, and many lay people have long suspected the same thing."
business,"In the coming months, ProPublica will use the IRS data we have obtained to explore in detail how the ultrawealthy avoid taxes, exploit loopholes and escape scrutiny from federal auditors."
business,But few specifics about individuals ever emerge in public. Tax information is among the most zealously guarded secrets in the federal government. ProPublica has decided to reveal individual tax information of some of the wealthiest Americans because it is only by seeing specifics that the public can understand the realities of the country’s tax system.
business,"Consider Bezos’ 2007, one of the years he paid zero in federal income taxes. Amazon’s stock more than doubled. Bezos’ fortune leapt $3.8 billion, according to Forbes, whose wealth estimates are widely cited. How did a person enjoying that sort of wealth explosion end up paying no income tax?"
business,"In that year, Bezos, who filed his taxes jointly with his then-wife, MacKenzie Scott, reported a paltry (for him) $46 million in income, largely from interest and dividend payments on outside investments. He was able to offset every penny he earned with losses from side investments and various deductions, like interest expenses on debts and the vague catchall category of “other expenses.”"
business,"His tax avoidance is even more striking if you examine 2006 to 2018, a period for which ProPublica has complete data. Bezos’ wealth increased by $127 billion, according to Forbes, but he reported a total of $6.5 billion in income. The $1.4 billion he paid in personal federal taxes is a massive number — yet it amounts to a 1.1% true tax rate on the rise in his fortune."
business,"In 2011, a year in which his wealth held roughly steady at $18 billion, Bezos filed a tax return reporting he lost money — his income that year was more than offset by investment losses. What’s more, because, according to the tax law, he made so little, he even claimed and received a $4,000 tax credit for his children."
business,"The tax math provides a clear incentive for this. If you own a company and take a huge salary, you’ll pay 37% in income tax on the bulk of it. Sell stock and you’ll pay 20% in capital gains tax — and lose some control over your company. But take out a loan, and these days you’ll pay a single-digit interest rate and no tax; since loans must be paid back, the IRS doesn’t consider them income. Banks typically require collateral, but the wealthy have plenty of that."
business,"For regular people, borrowing money is often something done out of necessity, say for a car or a home. But for the ultrawealthy, it can be a way to access billions without producing income, and thus, income tax."
business,"So how do megabillionaires pay their megabills while opting for $1 salaries and hanging onto their stock? According to public documents and experts, the answer for some is borrowing money — lots of it."
business,"The vast majority of the ultrawealthy’s loans do not appear in the tax records obtained by ProPublica since they are generally not disclosed to the IRS. But occasionally, the loans are disclosed in securities filings. In 2014, for example, Oracle revealed that its CEO, Ellison, had a credit line secured by about $10 billion of his shares."
business,"With the exception of one year when he exercised more than a billion dollars in stock options, Musk’s tax bills in no way reflect the fortune he has at his disposal. In 2015, he paid $68,000 in federal income tax. In 2017, it was $65,000, and in 2018 he paid no federal income tax. Between 2014 and 2018, he had a true tax rate of 3.27%."
business,"Last year Tesla reported that Musk had pledged some 92 million shares, which were worth about $57.7 billion as of May 29, 2021, as collateral for personal loans."
business,"Borrowing offers multiple benefits to Icahn: He gets huge tranches of cash to turbocharge his investment returns. Then he gets to deduct the interest from his taxes. In an interview, Icahn explained that he reports the profits and losses of his business empire on his personal taxes."
business,"The IRS records provide glimpses of other massive loans. In both 2016 and 2017, investor Carl Icahn, who ranks as the 40th-wealthiest American on the Forbes list, paid no federal income taxes despite reporting a total of $544 million in adjusted gross income (which the IRS defines as earnings minus items like student loan interest payments or alimony). Icahn had an outstanding loan of $1.2 billion with Bank of America among other loans, according to the IRS data. It was technically a mortgage because it was secured, at least in part, by Manhattan penthouse apartments and other properties."
business,"Icahn acknowledged that he is a “big borrower. I do borrow a lot of money.” Asked if he takes out loans also to lower his tax bill, Icahn said: “No, not at all. My borrowing is to win. I enjoy the competition. I enjoy winning.”"
business,"He said adjusted gross income was a misleading figure for him. After taking hundreds of millions in deductions for the interest on his loans, he registered tax losses for both years, he said. “I didn’t make money because, unfortunately for me, my interest was higher than my whole adjusted income.”"
business,"Skeptics might question our analysis of how little the superrich pay in taxes. For one, they might argue that owners of companies get hit by corporate taxes. They also might counter that some billionaires cannot avoid income — and therefore taxes. And after death, the common understanding goes, there’s a final no-escape clause: the estate tax, which imposes a steep tax rate on sums over $11.7 million."
business,"Asked whether it was appropriate that he had paid no income tax in certain years, Icahn said he was perplexed by the question. “There’s a reason it’s called income tax,” he said. “The reason is if, if you’re a poor person, a rich person, if you are Apple — if you have no income, you don’t pay taxes.” He added: “Do you think a rich person should pay taxes no matter what? I don’t think it’s germane. How can you ask me that question?”"
business,ProPublica found that none of these factors alter the fundamental picture.
business,"Take corporate taxes. When companies pay them, economists say, these costs are passed on to the companies’ owners, workers or even consumers. Models differ, but they generally assume big stockholders shoulder the lion’s share."
business,"Corporate taxes, however, have plummeted in recent decades in what has become a golden age of corporate tax avoidance. By sending profits abroad, companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple have often paid little or no U.S. corporate tax."
business,"It is also true that some billionaires don’t avoid taxes by avoiding incomes. In 2018, nine of the 25 wealthiest Americans reported more than $500 million in income and three more than $1 billion."
business,"For some of the nation’s wealthiest people, particularly Bezos and Musk, adding corporate taxes to the equation would hardly change anything at all. Other companies like Berkshire Hathaway and Walmart do pay more, which means that for people like Buffett and the Waltons, corporate tax could add significantly to their burden."
business,"In such cases, though, the data obtained by ProPublica shows billionaires have a palette of tax-avoidance options to offset their gains using credits, deductions (which can include charitable donations) or losses to lower or even zero out their tax bills. Some own sports teams that offer such lucrative write-offs that owners often end up paying far lower tax rates than their millionaire players. Others own commercial buildings that steadily rise in value but nevertheless can be used to throw off paper losses that offset income."
business,"In 2018, he reported income of $1.9 billion. When it came to his taxes, Bloomberg managed to slash his bill by using deductions made possible by tax cuts passed during the Trump administration, charitable donations of $968.3 million and credits for having paid foreign taxes. The end result was that he paid $70.7 million in income tax on that almost $2 billion in income. That amounts to just a 3.7% conventional income tax rate. Between 2014 and 2018, Bloomberg had a true tax rate of 1.30%."
business,"Michael Bloomberg, the 13th-richest American on the Forbes list, often reports high income because the profits of the private company he controls flow mainly to him."
business,"In a statement, a spokesman for Bloomberg noted that as a candidate, Bloomberg had advocated for a variety of tax hikes on the wealthy. “Mike Bloomberg pays the maximum tax rate on all federal, state, local and international taxable income as prescribed by law,” the spokesman wrote. And he cited Bloomberg’s philanthropic giving, offering the calculation that “taken together, what Mike gives to charity and pays in taxes amounts to approximately 75% of his annual income.”"
business,"Ultimately, after decades of wealth accumulation, the estate tax is supposed to serve as a backstop, allowing authorities an opportunity to finally take a piece of giant fortunes before they pass to a new generation. But in reality, preparing for death is more like the last stage of tax avoidance for the ultrawealthy."
business,The statement also noted: “The release of a private citizen’s tax returns should raise real privacy concerns regardless of political affiliation or views on tax policy. In the United States no private citizen should fear the illegal release of their taxes. We intend to use all legal means at our disposal to determine which individual or government entity leaked these and ensure that they are held responsible.”
business,"University of Southern California tax law professor Edward McCaffery has summarized the entire arc with the catchphrase “buy, borrow, die.”"
business,"The revelations provided by the IRS data come at a crucial moment. Wealth inequality has become one of the defining issues of our age. The president and Congress are considering the most ambitious tax increases in decades on those with high incomes. But the American tax conversation has been dominated by debate over incremental changes, such as whether the top tax rate should be 39.6% rather than 37%.
ProPublica’s data shows that while some wealthy Americans, such as hedge fund managers, would pay more taxes under the current Biden administration proposals, the vast majority of the top 25 would see little change.
The tax data was provided to ProPublica after we published a series of articles scrutinizing the IRS. The articles exposed how years of budget cuts have hobbled the agency’s ability to enforce the law and how the largest corporations and the rich have benefited from the IRS’ weakness. They also showed how people in poor regions are now more likely to be audited than those in affluent areas.
ProPublica is not disclosing how it obtained the data, which was given to us in raw form, with no conditions or conclusions. ProPublica reporters spent months processing and analyzing the material to transform it into a usable database.
We then verified the information by comparing elements of it with dozens of already public tax details (in court documents, politicians’ financial disclosures and news stories) as well as by vetting it with individuals whose tax information is contained in the trove. Every person whose tax information is described in this story was asked to comment. Those who responded, including Buffett, Bloomberg and Icahn, all said they had paid the taxes they owed.
A spokesman for Soros said in a statement: “Between 2016 and 2018 George Soros lost money on his investments, therefore he did not owe federal income taxes in those years. Mr. Soros has long supported higher taxes for wealthy Americans.” Personal and corporate representatives of Bezos declined to receive detailed questions about the matter. ProPublica attempted to reach Scott through her divorce attorney, a personal representative and family members; she did not respond. Musk responded to an initial query with a lone punctuation mark: “?” After we sent detailed questions to him, he did not reply.
One of the billionaires mentioned in this article objected, arguing that publishing personal tax information is a violation of privacy. We have concluded that the public interest in knowing this information at this pivotal moment outweighs that legitimate concern.
The consequences of allowing the most prosperous to game the tax system have been profound. Federal budgets, apart from military spending, have been constrained for decades. Roads and bridges have crumbled, social services have withered and the solvency of Social Security and Medicare is perpetually in question.
There is an even more fundamental issue than which programs get funded or not: Taxes are a kind of collective sacrifice. No one loves giving their hard-earned money to the government. But the system works only as long as it’s perceived to be fair.
Our analysis of tax data for the 25 richest Americans quantifies just how unfair the system has become.
By the end of 2018, the 25 were worth $1.1 trillion.
For comparison, it would take 14.3 million ordinary American wage earners put together to equal that same amount of wealth.
The personal federal tax bill for the top 25 in 2018: $1.9 billion.
The bill for the wage earners: $143 billion.The idea of a regular tax on income, much less on wealth, does not appear in the country’s founding documents. In fact, Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution explicitly prohibits “direct” taxes on citizens under most circumstances. This meant that for decades, the U.S. government mainly funded itself through “indirect” taxes: tariffs and levies on consumer goods like tobacco and alcohol.
With the costs of the Civil War looming, Congress imposed a national income tax in 1861. The wealthy helped force its repeal soon after the war ended. (Their pique could only have been exacerbated by the fact that the law required public disclosure. The annual income of the moguls of the day — $1.3 million for William Astor; $576,000 for Cornelius Vanderbilt — was listed in the pages of The New York Times in 1865.)
By the late 19th and early 20th century, wealth inequality was acute and the political climate was changing. The federal government began expanding, creating agencies to protect food, workers and more. It needed funding, but tariffs were pinching regular Americans more than the rich. The Supreme Court had rejected an 1894 law that would have created an income tax. So Congress moved to amend the Constitution. The 16th Amendment was ratified in 1913 and gave the government power “to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived.”
In the early years, the personal income tax worked as Congress intended, falling squarely on the richest. In 1918, only 15% of American families owed any tax. The top 1% paid 80% of the revenue raised, according to historian W. Elliot Brownlee.
But a question remained: What would count as income and what wouldn’t? In 1916, a woman named Myrtle Macomber received a dividend for her Standard Oil of California shares. She owed taxes, thanks to the new law. The dividend had not come in cash, however. It came in the form of an additional share for every two shares she already held. She paid the taxes and then brought a court challenge: Yes, she’d gotten a bit richer, but she hadn’t received any money. Therefore, she argued, she’d received no “income.”
Four years later, the Supreme Court agreed. In Eisner v. Macomber, the high court ruled that income derived only from proceeds. A person needed to sell an asset — stock, bond or building — and reap some money before it could be taxed.
Since then, the concept that income comes only from proceeds — when gains are “realized” — has been the bedrock of the U.S. tax system. Wages are taxed. Cash dividends are taxed. Gains from selling assets are taxed. But if a taxpayer hasn’t sold anything, there is no income and therefore no tax.
Contemporary critics of Macomber were plentiful and prescient. Cordell Hull, the congressman known as the “father” of the income tax, assailed the decision, according to scholar Marjorie Kornhauser. Hull predicted that tax avoidance would become common. The ruling opened a gaping loophole, Hull warned, allowing industrialists to build a company and borrow against the stock to pay living expenses. Anyone could “live upon the value” of their company stock “without selling it, and of course, without ever paying” tax, he said.
Hull’s prediction would reach full flower only decades later, spurred by a series of epochal economic, legal and cultural changes that began to gather momentum in the 1970s. Antitrust enforcers increasingly accepted mergers and stopped trying to break up huge corporations. For their part, companies came to obsess over the value of their stock to the exclusion of nearly everything else. That helped give rise in the last 40 years to a series of corporate monoliths — beginning with Microsoft and Oracle in the 1980s and 1990s and continuing to Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple today — that often have concentrated ownership, high profit margins and rich share prices. The winner-take-all economy has created modern fortunes that by some measures eclipse those of John D. Rockefeller, J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie.
In the here and now, the ultrawealthy use an array of techniques that aren’t available to those of lesser means to get around the tax system.
Certainly, there are illegal tax evaders among them, but it turns out billionaires don’t have to evade taxes exotically and illicitly — they can avoid them routinely and legally.
Most Americans have to work to live. When they do, they get paid — and they get taxed. The federal government considers almost every dollar workers earn to be “income,” and employers take taxes directly out of their paychecks.
The Bezoses of the world have no need to be paid a salary. Bezos’ Amazon wages have long been set at the middle-class level of around $80,000 a year.
For years, there’s been something of a competition among elite founder-CEOs to go even lower. Steve Jobs took $1 in salary when he returned to Apple in the 1990s. Facebook’s Zuckerberg, Oracle’s Larry Ellison and Google’s Larry Page have all done the same.
Yet this is not the self-effacing gesture it appears to be: Wages are taxed at a high rate. The top 25 wealthiest Americans reported $158 million in wages in 2018, according to the IRS data. That’s a mere 1.1% of what they listed on their tax forms as their total reported income. The rest mostly came from dividends and the sale of stock, bonds or other investments, which are taxed at lower rates than wages.
As Congressman Hull envisioned long ago, the ultrawealthy typically hold fast to shares in the companies they’ve founded. Many titans of the 21st century sit on mountains of what are known as unrealized gains, the total size of which fluctuates each day as stock prices rise and fall. Of the $4.25 trillion in wealth held by U.S. billionaires, some $2.7 trillion is unrealized, according to Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, economists at the University of California, Berkeley.
Buffett has famously held onto his stock in the company he founded, Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate that owns Geico, Duracell and significant stakes in American Express and Coca-Cola. That has allowed Buffett to largely avoid transforming his wealth into income. From 2015 through 2018, he reported annual income ranging from $11.6 million to $25 million. That may seem like a lot, but Buffett ranks as roughly the world’s sixth-richest person — he’s worth $110 billion as of Forbes’ estimate in May 2021. At least 14,000 U.S. taxpayers in 2015 reported higher income than him, according to IRS data.
There’s also a second strategy Buffett relies on that minimizes income, and therefore, taxes. Berkshire does not pay a dividend, the sum (a piece of the profits, in theory) that many companies pay each quarter to those who own their stock. Buffett has always argued that it is better to use that money to find investments for Berkshire that will further boost the value of shares held by him and other investors. If Berkshire had offered anywhere close to the average dividend in recent years, Buffett would have received over $1 billion in dividend income and owed hundreds of millions in taxes each year.
Many Silicon Valley and infotech companies have emulated Buffett’s model, eschewing stock dividends, at least for a time. In the 1980s and 1990s, companies like Microsoft and Oracle offered shareholders rocketing growth and profits but did not pay dividends. Google, Facebook, Amazon and Tesla do not pay dividends.
In a detailed written response, Buffett defended his practices but did not directly address ProPublica’s true tax rate calculation. “I continue to believe that the tax code should be changed substantially,” he wrote, adding that he thought “huge dynastic wealth is not desirable for our society.”
The decision not to have Berkshire pay dividends has been supported by the vast majority of his shareholders. “I can’t think of any large public company with shareholders so united in their reinvestment beliefs,” he wrote. And he pointed out that Berkshire Hathaway pays significant corporate taxes, accounting for 1.5% of total U.S. corporate taxes in 2019 and 2020.
Buffett reiterated that he has begun giving his enormous fortune away and ultimately plans to donate 99.5% of it to charity. “I believe the money will be of more use to society if disbursed philanthropically than if it is used to slightly reduce an ever-increasing U.S. debt,” he wrote."
business,"The notion of dying as a tax benefit seems paradoxical. Normally when someone sells an asset, even a minute before they die, they owe 20% capital gains tax. But at death, that changes. Any capital gains till that moment are not taxed. This allows the ultrarich and their heirs to avoid paying billions in taxes. The “step-up in basis” is widely recognized by experts across the political spectrum as a flaw in the code."
business,"Then comes the estate tax, which, at 40%, is among the highest in the federal code. This tax is supposed to give the government one last chance to get a piece of all those unrealized gains and other assets the wealthiest Americans accumulate over their lifetimes."
business,"That windfall is among the many factors that have led the country to an inflection point, one that traces back to a half-century of growing wealth inequality and the financial crisis of 2008, which left many with lasting economic damage. American history is rich with such turns. There have been famous acts of tax resistance, like the Boston Tea Party, countered by less well-known efforts to have the rich pay more."
business,"In the past year and a half, hundreds of thousands of Americans have died from COVID-19, while millions were thrown out of work. But one of the bleakest periods in American history turned out to be one of the most lucrative for billionaires. They added $1.2 trillion to their fortunes from January 2020 to the end of April of this year, according to Forbes."
business,"Wealth managers offer clients a range of opaque and complicated trusts that allow the wealthiest Americans to give large sums to their heirs without paying estate taxes. The IRS data obtained by ProPublica gives some insight into the ultrawealthy’s estate planning, showing hundreds of these trusts."
business,"The result is that large fortunes can pass largely intact from one generation to the next. Of the 25 richest people in America today, about a quarter are heirs: three are Waltons, two are scions of the Mars candy fortune and one is the son of Estée Lauder."
business,"It’s clear, though, from aggregate IRS data, tax research and what little trickles into the public arena about estate planning of the wealthy that they can readily escape turning over almost half of the value of their estates. Many of the richest create foundations for philanthropic giving, which provide large charitable tax deductions during their lifetimes and bypass the estate tax when they die."
business,"One such incident, over half a century ago, appeared as if it might spark great change. President Lyndon Johnson’s outgoing treasury secretary, Joseph Barr, shocked the nation when he revealed that 155 Americans making over $200,000 (about $1.6 million today) had paid no taxes. That group, he told the Senate, included 21 millionaires."
business,"“We face now the possibility of a taxpayer revolt if we do not soon make major reforms in our income taxes,” Barr said. Members of Congress received more furious letters about the tax scofflaws that year than they did about the Vietnam War."
business,"Congress did pass some reforms, but the long-term trend was a revolt in the opposite direction, which then accelerated with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. Since then, through a combination of political donations, lobbying, charitable giving and even direct bids for political office, the ultrawealthy have helped shape the debate about taxation in their favor."
business,"One apparent exception: Buffett, who broke ranks with his billionaire cohort to call for higher taxes on the rich. In a famous New York Times op-ed in 2011, Buffett wrote, “My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress. It’s time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice.”"
business,"Buffett did something in that article that few Americans do: He publicly revealed how much he had paid in personal federal taxes the previous year ($6.9 million). Separately, Forbes estimated his fortune had risen $3 billion that year. Using that information, an observer could have calculated his true tax rate; it was 0.2%. But then, as now, the discussion that ensued on taxes was centered on the traditional income tax rate."
business,"In 2011, President Barack Obama proposed legislation, known as the Buffett Rule. It would have raised income tax rates on people reporting over a million dollars a year. It didn’t pass. Even if it had, however, the Buffett Rule wouldn’t have raised Buffett’s taxes significantly. If you can avoid income, you can avoid taxes."
business,"Some Democrats have gone further, floating ideas that challenge the tax structure as it’s existed for the last century. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has proposed taxing unrealized capital gains, a shot through the heart of Macomber. Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have proposed wealth taxes."
business,"Today, just a few years after Republicans passed a massive tax cut that disproportionately benefited the wealthy, the country may be facing another swing of the pendulum, back toward a popular demand to raise taxes on the wealthy. In the face of growing inequality and with spending ambitions that rival those of Franklin D. Roosevelt or Johnson, the Biden administration has proposed a slate of changes. These include raising the tax rates on people making over $400,000 and bumping the top income tax rate from 37% to 39.6%, with a top rate for long-term capital gains to match that. The administration also wants to up the corporate tax rate and to increase the IRS’ budget."
business,"Aggressive new laws would likely inspire new, sophisticated avoidance techniques. A few countries, including Switzerland and Spain, have wealth taxes on a small scale. Several, most recently France, have abandoned them as unworkable. Opponents contend that they are complicated to administer, as it is hard to value assets, particularly of private companies and property."
business,What it would take for a fundamental overhaul of the U.S. tax system is not clear. But the IRS data obtained by ProPublica illuminates that all of these conversations have been taking place in a vacuum. Neither political leaders nor the public have ever had an accurate picture of how comprehensively the wealthiest Americans avoid paying taxes.
business,"Buffett and his fellow billionaires have known this secret for a long time. As Buffett put it in 2011: “There’s been class warfare going on for the last 20 years, and my class has won.”"

business,"The move is a remarkable blow to Exxon’s leadership, which had until Wednesday largely selected its own directors for the company’s 12-member board. The new board members were pushed by a small, activist hedge fund, Engine No. 1, that garnered the support of some of Exxon’s biggest investors in calling for U.S. energy companies to shift their business models as climate change intensifies."
business,"The New York Times notes that Engine No. 1 owns less than 1% of Exxon’s stock but began its push for new board members in December, the latest initiative by activists to force oil companies to address climate change linked to the burning of fossil fuels. The publication added that the European energy companies have spent the last decade beginning to invest in renewable energy sources, but U.S. companies have so far resisted such changes, calling them unsustainable and bad for business."

business,"The campaign, spearheaded by nonprofits Open to All and Hollaback as well as the Retail Industry Leaders Association, comes as workers face increased harassment as they try to enforce social distancing and mask protocols during the pandemic. Among those who have been the targets of abuse are people of color, those with disabilities and those who identify as LGBTQ."
business,NEW YORK (AP) — A dozen retailers including Gap and H&M are collaborating on a campaign this fall to enlist customers to combat bad behavior against retail workers.
business,"Participating retailers will have signage in their stores with QR codes, allowing customers to sign a pledge of support. There will also be a tool kit designed by Hollaback to show how customers can help, including how to create a distraction for the abuser as well as documenting the situation and bringing in someone else to help."
business,"Calla Devlin Rongerude, director of Open to All, said the campaign is not asking customers to step in to physically stop altercations, but rather to help de-escalate the situation and show support for workers."
business,"“There is a lot of ambiguity,” Rongerude said. “People have a lot of fatigue. That is when tempers flare.”"
business,"Even as the spread of COVID-19 slows, retailers fear abusive behavior will worsen as stores anticipate big crowds for the back-to-school and holiday seasons. With many states and businesses relaxing mask mandates and customers experiencing pandemic fatigue, workers worry about their safety."
business,"The Open to All coalition is made up of about 600,000 businesses, mostly retail establishments, that have collaborated on training and hiring practices. It launched in 2018 with companies like Levi Strauss & Co. and Gap pledging not to discriminate against employees or customers based on race, sexual orientation, or other characteristics. The movement was spurred by controversies such as florists refusing to provide flowers for gay weddings and stores turning away Muslim customers."
business,"The pandemic has since exposed the vulnerabilities of front-line workers. Last September, a group of retailers felt they needed to do something more to protect their employees against discriminatory and racist behavior, Rongerude said. Although these abusive customers are a minority, she said they still have damaging effects on shoppers and workers alike."

business,"Then, at the annual shareholder meeting of Exxon Mobil Corp. in Dallas, a comparatively tiny activist hedge fund seeking to shift the oil giant away from fossil fuels and toward renewables won two seats on the board of directors."
business,"“This really is the start of a new era for Big Oil,” said Clark Williams-Derry, an oil analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, an energy research outfit. “You can’t shrug this off as having had a bad day. This is all three largest supermajors taking it on the chin from shareholders or the courts.”"
business,"That afternoon, climate-concerned shareholders at Chevron Corporation’s annual investor confab voted to force the company to make a plan to cut emissions generated from the use of its product ― making the Texas firm responsible for the pollution its customers create when burning oil and gas."
business,"It’s been a turbulent time for the industry, which saw record-breaking financial losses last year as government lockdowns to prevent the spread of COVID-19 grounded planes, halted factories and kept automobiles idle, briefly sending the price of oil below zero for the first time in history. Governments across the world have taken bigger roles in the economy since the start of the pandemic, and they face mounting pressure to restrict fossil fuels, invest in zero-emissions alternatives and slash energy use. Still, it’s difficult to parse what the final impact of Monday’s decisions will be on the industry."
business,"Shell said it would appeal the ruling, which Dutch Judge Larisa Alwin said would have “far-reaching consequences” and may “curb potential growth of the Shell group.” But industry analysts warned that the outcome would likely prompt more legal and investor challenges to fossil fuel producers. "
business,"“This case epitomizes the expanding fronts where fossil-fuel companies are coming under pressure: On top of investors and regulators demanding carbon cuts, now heavy emitters are facing censure through the courts,” Will Nichols, head of environment and climate change at the risk-analysis company Verisk Maplecroft, told The Wall Street Journal. “We can expect this case to embolden activists and pressure groups.”"
business,"The vote amounted to a signal of disapproval of the company’s management, as the two new members of the board of directors will be independent of the firm. Yet their influence over company policy could still be limited if the other members of Exxon Mobil’s board rally behind Woods."
business,"The shareholder victories in particular may spur more activist investors to launch internal campaigns for reform. In regulatory filings, Exxon Mobil said it spent $35 million to counter hedge fund Engine No. 1’s $30 million campaign to put climate advocates on the oil giant’s board. Despite an eight-figure war chest and command of a corporate Goliath worth nearly $250 billion, Exxon Mobil CEO Darren Woods lost resoundingly to a financial David worth just $50 million."
business,"The investor revolt at Chevron offered a more direct repudiation of the company’s strategy. Requiring the firm to slash emissions from its products marks “a clear directive,” Williams-Derry said."
business,"“It’s going to be similar to what happened to Big Tobacco in the mid-1990s, [where it’s] still one of the better performing sectors, but not investing in growth, just reaping cash flow,” Valle said."
business,"That doesn’t mean the end of oil. New projects will likely continue in other countries with looser regulations or weaker enforcement. And the publicly traded companies in North America and Europe may face a similar stock-market trajectory to another industry, one whose public relations strategies fossil fuel executives borrowed over much of the past three decades in a bid to stave off regulations. Once denying the link between cigarette smoking and cancer no longer worked, tobacco firms largely stopped growing, but kept making money."
business,"People kept smoking, albeit fewer of them and in far fewer environments. To make oil consumption a thing of the past, Valle said, “you still have to change societal needs.”"
business,"But enforcing that measure in a way that seriously lowers emissions could prove challenging, said Fernando Valle, an oil analyst at the energy consultancy BloombergNEF."
business,"“It’s such a tenuous line, because it’s difficult to decide what are your emissions versus everybody else’s,” he said. "
business,"The most immediate effect could be the clear exclusion of Chevron from investment funds that brand themselves as complying with environmental and social governance principles, or ESG, particularly as regulators tighten rules on what stocks qualify under that label. "
business,"Overall, though, Valle said it shows “the regulatory environment is just getting tougher and tougher, not just in Europe but in North America now as well.” "
business,"The best evidence of what’s to come, he said, actually rests in a fourth oil company. Canadian giant Suncor Energy recently announced its latest five-year plan and included “almost no growth and no new projects because of high regulatory costs.” "
business,"“That is the sort of directive that you can’t just shuck and jive and say you’ve met that,” he said. “If the carbon content of the fuel you’re selling is going up and you’ve been told it needs to go down, you’re in trouble.”"

business,"Kroger, the largest grocery chain in the U.S., said in a statement to HuffPost that it plans to continue requiring customers to wear masks when they visit stores. Walmart, the largest retailer in the country, did not immediately respond when asked whether it’s adjusting its mask policy in light of the CDC’s change. Target told USA Today that it’s keeping its mask requirement in place and will “review updated guidance from the CDC and re-evaluate.” "
business,"Like employers, states were responding to the new guidance in different ways. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) lifted the state’s mask mandate on Friday after the CDC’s announcement, while New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) and New Jersey Gov.

business,"But there may be some discrepancies within states. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey said the city would keep its requirement for masking indoors despite the change in Minnesota policy. Mayors of other major cities, including Washington and New York, said they would take some time to review the new CDC guidance before changing their own local rules. "
business,"“These conflicting positions put retailers and their employees in incredibly difficult situations,” the group said."
business,"The Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade group for retailers, asked that customers follow a store’s policy regardless of the new CDC guidance.

business,The masks are coming off in stores around the country.
business,"The change from federal health officials has led to a patchwork of different rules from one company to the next, and even at different locations of the same chain. That’s because retailers still must abide by local regulations, and some cities and states are keeping their mask mandates in place for the time being."
business,"The CDC’s new guidance says that fully vaccinated people can go without face coverings in most situations, including inside, while those who are still not vaccinated should continue masking up. "
business,Kroger said it was updating its policy “based on the CDC’s science-based guidance and the input of our associates.” The company said employees in its pharmacies and clinics would have to keep wearing masks regardless of their vaccination status.
business,"The following major retailers have all dropped their mask requirements for vaccinated customers as of May 21, though in some cases workers must continue wearing them:"

business,"Worker advocates have said the new rules put store employees in an awkward and unsafe position, since they have no way of knowing which customers are vaccinated and which are not. So far, around two out of five U.S. adults are fully vaccinated. "
business,"“Keeping retail mask rules in place for most people will help us protect each other and our families,” Marc Perrone, the union’s president, said in a statement."
business,"During the pandemic, many retail workers have had to deal with hostile shoppers who ignored requirements on face coverings and social distancing. The United Food and Commercial Workers union said many of those same customers will surely go without masks before they are vaccinated. On Thursday, the union asked retailers to “assure customers that the vast majority of people in their stores will still be masked.” "
business,"The National Employment Law Project, a worker advocacy group, said workplaces where employees are in close contact should still require masks and social distancing, despite the new CDC guidance. The group said the new recommendations from federal officials have “created confusion in the workplace, leaving the nation’s most vulnerable workers, such as those in meatpacking, poultry, and retail, unprotected.”"
business,CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky defended the agency’s new guidance while testifying before lawmakers on Capitol Hill this week.
business,"“The country is not uniform,” Walensky said Wednesday. “You really do need to interpret our guidance in the context of what is happening in your community.” "
business,"Many workplaces are not ready to get rid of their mask requirements for vaccinated employees. In consultation with the United Auto Workers union, the Big Three automakers of Ford, General Motors and Stellantis have decided to keep their mask mandates in place at their factories until the Occupational Safety and Health Administration addresses the CDC’s new guidance. Industrial workplaces do not have to contend with the same customer dynamic that retailers do."
business,"Most safety health experts assumed the standard would include a mask requirement, but the new recommendations from the CDC have scrambled that expectation. If OSHA tried to move ahead with a workplace mask mandate now, it would conflict with the guidance just issued by a different federal agency."
business,"“We know that masks can be uncomfortable, but we ask that everyone comply,” the UAW said in a statement."
business,"OSHA, which is part of the Labor Department, has been developing an emergency temporary standard for coronavirus that employers would be obligated to follow, under threat of fine. The standard has not been issued yet and is sitting at the White House under review, even though the Biden administration originally suggested it would implement one by mid-March. "
business,"“One clear lesson from the last 16 months is that the honor system does not protect workers from COVID-19 infections,” he said."
business,Scott said it was a mistake to leave workplace safety guidelines for coronavirus voluntary rather than mandatory.
business,"Kroger grocery company CEO Rodney McMullen cut COVID-19 hazard pay for food workers last year just months into the pandemic — then scooped up a record $22.4 million in compensation for himself, Bloomberg reported Thursday."
business,"The CDC guidance, paired with the delay of an OSHA standard, has drawn criticism from Democrats. Rep. Bobby Scott (D-Va.), the chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, said in a statement that the White House was ”dragging its feet on a review process that has no end in sight.”"
business,"Median pay for Kroger’s workers fell 8%, to an annual $24,600. Kroger’s full-time workers, however, did get a bonus a year ago: $300. The Cincinnati-based company, the nation’s largest supermarket chain, employs about 465,000 people."
business,"McMullen’s pay package was revealed Thursday in a regulatory filing. His compensation rose almost 6% from the prior year, padded by a bigger bonus, a salary hike and stock awards, Bloomberg noted. That was McMullen’s biggest take ever since he became CEO in 2013. "
business,McMullen early last year proudly announced a $2 hourly hazard increase — which he termed a “Hero Bonus” — for store and warehouse employees who continued to work as they risked contracting the coronavirus.
business,"But the bonus was cut in May 2020, even as COVID-19 surged, sparking a storm of controversy. “The hazard pay is disappearing. The hazard is not,” Bloomberg noted at the time. "
business,“How do you go from a hero to zero when there’s still a pandemic out there?” asked one worker.
business,Kroger has closed stores this year rather than comply with city ordinances that require hazard pay for grocery store workers.
business,"Things haven’t been tough all over during the COVID-19 pandemic ― for CEOs and the ultra rich. Billionaires got 54% richer last year. That’s a $4 trillion boost for the world’s 2,365 billionaires."
business,"Median pay for CEOs at more than 300 of the nation’s largest public companies zoomed to $13.7 million last year, up from $12.8 million a year earlier, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis last month. The median CEO pay increase was nearly 15%, the analysis found."
business,"CEOs of 350 large publicly traded companies in 2019 earned an average 320 times more than the typical worker in the same company, according to the Economic Policy Institute. In 1989, the average ratio was 61-to-1."
business,"“Kroger continues to reward and recognize our associates for their incredible work during this historic time,” a spokesperson told Bloomberg in an emailed statement in response to the company’s extremely top-heavy reward system. The spokesperson noted that the company is also offering $100 to everyone who gets a COVID-19 vaccine."
business,"Colonial Pipeline has restarted operations after a cybersecurity attack late last week forced the 5,500-mile privately owned pipeline system to temporarily shut down, affecting the national fuel supply. "
business,"Kroger raked in record revenue last year as people largely stopped eating out and boosted their grocery shopping. But CEOs running companies that hemorrhaged money also did well. Even though Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings lost $4 billion last year, for example, CEO Frank Del Rio’s pay doubled to $36.4 million, the Journal reported."
business,"Colonial, which is the biggest fuel pipeline operator in the United States, said that it began the restart about 5 p.m. EDT on Wednesday. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm first announced the restoration on Twitter, saying she had just spoken to Colonial’s CEO about the decision."
business,"“Following this restart, it will take several days for the product delivery supply chain to return to normal,” Colonial said in a statement. “Some markets served by Colonial Pipeline may experience, or continue to experience, intermittent service interruptions during the start-up period. Colonial will move as much gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel as is safely possible and will continue to do so until markets return to normal.”"
business,"Last Friday, an international criminal gang known as DarkSide carried out a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline. In such an attack, hackers infiltrate a network and encrypt important data, offering to give back control to the owners only if they pay a ransom. It’s unclear how much of Colonial’s network was infected. However, the company said it “proactively took certain systems offline to contain the threat.”"
business,"The pipeline system runs from the Texas Gulf Coast to the New York metropolitan area, and it transports more than 100 million gallons of fuel a day ― about 45% of the fuel consumed on the East Coast, according to the Georgia-based company. Government officials at all levels waived safety and environmental rules in order to speed the delivery of fuel to drivers and airports while Colonial faced its days-long attack."
business,"The company did not say whether it has or will pay the ransom. When asked about it, the White House said questions about such a decision are meant for Colonial to answer. However, the FBI advises against paying a ransom."
business,"The White House and members of President Joe Biden’s Cabinet have said that consumers may feel a supply crunch while Colonial works to resume operations but assured the public that there is no need to panic. However, more than 1,000 gas stations in the Southeast reported running out of fuel, mostly because of what analysts said has been unwarranted hoarding of gasoline by drivers. "
business,"On the same day that Colonial initiated its restoration, Biden signed an executive order targeting national cybersecurity. The order is meant to protect federal networks, improve information-sharing between the government and the private sector on cyber issues, and strengthen the federal government’s ability to respond to cyberattacks. The requirements apply to the federal government and companies who contract with it."
business,"The executive order gives Congress the opportunity to take some of the information-sharing and breach-reporting requirements Biden just authorized and apply them to a broader set of private companies, especially those like Colonial that affect critical infrastructure, according to a senior administration official. As of Tuesday, Colonial had not shared information about its breach with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The federal agency said at the time of the attack, though, that it was “engaged with the company and our interagency partners regarding the situation.”"
business,"When asked what kind of steps the federal government would take to encourage private companies to tighten cybersecurity to prevent attacks, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said, “That is out of our hands.”"
business,"“I would say that one of the reasons that we have stood up … and elevated a public-private coordinating apparatus or effort to work with the private sector is because we want to ensure that well-intentioned companies understand what they need to put in place and understand the risks that they’re facing,” Psaki said."
business,"“Because we know, as this is an example of, that it won’t just impact that company, that it can impact ― depending on the entity ― the American public.”"
business,"But some energy regulators and policymakers said that it doesn’t make sense that the country’s almost 2 million miles of oil and gas pipelines are able to largely avoid federal cybersecurity oversight, unlike the electric grid that is overseen by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission."
business,"Glick called on Congress this week to establish such mandatory cybersecurity standards. However, since the Colonial cyberattack, major fossil-fuel lobbyists, like the American Petroleum Institute, have tried to block such requirements for the country’s energy industry. "
business,"“Simply encouraging pipelines to voluntarily adopt best practices is an inadequate response to the ever-increasing number and sophistication of malevolent cyber actors,” FERC Chairman Richard Glick said in a statement. “Mandatory pipeline security standards are necessary to protect the infrastructure on which we all depend.”"
business,"Evergreen Action, a climate policy group that advocates for clean energy, said Wednesday that the Colonial Pipeline situation shows why the country cannot give “corporate polluters” so much control."
business,"“The industry’s response to the Colonial Pipeline shutdown is just the latest in a long string of reminders of why we cannot allow corporate polluters to set the agenda for our energy future,” Executive Director Jamal Raad said in a statement. “Earlier this year, when an avoidable winter blackout caused by failing fossil fuel infrastructure resulted in dozens of deaths and millions of Texans losing power, the oil and gas industry and their cronies in Washington tried to deflect blame by spreading lies and misinformation."
business,“The pattern is clear: fossil fuel corporations can’t be relied on to deliver the resilient and reliable energy infrastructure we need. We don’t have to remain captive to the poisonous whims of the fossil fuel industry.”
business,The investor group is pushing to replace four of the oil giant’s board members with executives they say are better suited to both strengthen the company’s finances and lead it through the transition to cleaner energy. The fight represents a moment of reckoning for major publicly traded companies to address a global crisis.
business,"NEW YORK (AP) — ExxonMobil is facing a major challenge from a group of investors in one of the biggest fights a corporate boardroom has endured over its stance on climate change, an issue of rising urgency for many shareholders."
business,"Engine No. 1 wants Exxon to refresh its board with directors who have a track record of managing change in the energy sector. The group asserts that Exxon has under-performed compared with its peers, having lost market value even when demand for oil and gas was growing. It also argues that the company lacks a credible strategy to create value in a de-carbonizing world and that its board lacks people with experience in successfully revamping an energy giant."
business,"Regardless of the outcome of the shareholder vote, to be announced after the annual shareholder meeting Wednesday, the challenge reflects momentum among consumers, investors and government leaders around the globe to pivot away from fossil fuels and invest in a future where energy needs are increasingly met using renewable sources. To that end, President Joe Biden has set the ambitious goal of slashing America’s greenhouse gas emissions in half by the end of the decade."
business,"Engine No. 1, the name of the hedge fund that has mounted the challenge, owns just a sliver of Exxon’s shares. But the dissident slate of board members it has put forward commands the backing of some of the country’s most powerful institutional investors, including the largest public pension funds."
business,"In opposing the challenge, Exxon counters that it has continually refreshed its board with directors who have expertise in energy, capital allocation and transitions. It contends that the company has been investing in low-carbon solutions, including a recent proposal to transform the Houston Ship Channel into a hub for carbon capture and sequestration. That technology, still under development, involves pulling carbon dioxide out of the air and storing it underground off shore."
business,"In that proposal, Exxon called on government and industry to together invest $100 billion. Exxon has said it would spend $3 billion through 2025 on carbon capture and other low-carbon initiatives."
business,"“We’re at a tipping point,” said Aeisha Mastagni, portfolio manager at the California State Teachers’ Retirement System, known as CalSTRS, one of the nation’s largest pension funds and among the major institutional investors that backed the alternative group of directors. “You’re seeing investors from all around the world that are wanting to see better disclosure around climate change risk, you’re seeing shareholder proposals that are passing with increased shareholder support, and now we have this monumental vote at ExxonMobil.”"
business,"Those efforts have fallen short of the demands of Exxon’s dissident investor groups. Other major oil companies, from British Petroleum and Shell to Conoco Phillips and Chevron, have done more to satisfy shareholders. Investors want more corporate disclosures of climate-damaging emissions, and they expect energy companies to diversify their portfolios to include more renewable sources, said Anne Simpson, managing investment director for board governance and sustainability at the California Public Employees’ Retirement System — known as CalPERS — America’s largest pension fund."
business,"“Usually what happens is, we have a collaborative approach where we work with companies,” Simpson said. “I would say it’s in rare circumstances that investors feel the need to actually put their own candidates forward. But that is because the nominating committee hasn’t been able to fulfill investors’ expectations. Exxon has had several years attempting to address this issue.”"
business,"CalPERS, a heavyweight in the investing community, voted for Engine No. 1′s slate of candidates. The pension fund asserts that through its engagement and proxy voting, it has compelled hundreds of companies to add new directors to their boards."
business,"Support for shareholder proposals that focus on climate change is rapidly growing. In 2015, Glass Lewis, a firm that advises institutional investors, reviewed 14 shareholder proposals that requested additional disclosures on climate-related issues, such as the companies’ levels of greenhouse gas emissions."
business,"“What we’re finding with other oil companies,” Simpson said, “is we’re making progress, and Exxon needs to catch up. Exxon is still saying one thing and doing another.”"
business,"This year, 25 climate-related shareholder proposals have made it onto ballots, and those that have been voted on so far have received support from 59% of shareholders on average, according to the Institute for Shareholder Services."
business,"By 2017, there were 21 such shareholder proposals that went to a vote; three of them received over 50% approval. Before then, none had received majority support, according to Glass Lewis."
business,"The International Energy Agency this month warned that immediate action was needed to reshape the world’s energy sector, and it recommended ending investments in new oil and gas wells and coal mines."
business,"“Even if you love fossil fuels, you have to acknowledge that they’re not making any more of them, and any company that wants to be sustainable over the long term has got to figure out what their next step is going to be,” said Nell Minow, vice chair of ValueEdge Advisors, an influential figure in corporate governance who voted in support of Engine No. 1. “There’s a massive demographic shift. I think the millennial generation and the generation that follow are much, much more sensitive on these issues as employees, as consumers and as investors, than the generations that have gone before.”"
business,"Also backing the alternate slate of directors was the New York State Common Retirement Fund, which argued that Exxon has failed to properly manage its exposure to climate risks."
business,"The nation’s most influential proxy advisory firms, including Institutional Shareholder Services, Glass Lewis and Egan Jones, also backed most or all of the candidates proposed by Engine No. 1. The proxy advisory firms conduct research and advise institutional shareholders on how to vote on such matters."
business,"Some experts say the pressure from Engine No. 1 and other shareholders appears to be making a difference at Exxon. The company’s carbon sequestration proposal was not a major part of the conversation at Exxon a few years ago, but now management is talking about committing $3 billion to low-carbon ventures, said Stewart Glickman, energy equity analyst at CFRA."
business,"“Climate change and carbon is capturing more dollars tied to that than anything else,” Glickman said. “So the writing is on the wall that more money is shifting in this direction.”"
business,"For many people, getting the shot requires taking time off work ― not just once but twice, if the vaccine is a two-dose regimen. A bout of side effects may well keep someone off the job for another day or two after getting jabbed. But the U.S. has no universal guarantee of paid time off, and low-wage workers are much less likely to enjoy the benefit than high-income workers. "
business,New data from the Kaiser Family Foundation suggest a lack of paid leave may be holding some of those people back from getting vaccinated.
business,"There are a lot of reasons Americans are reluctant to get vaccinated, and one of them has nothing to do with religion or politics: It’s the fear of lost income."
business,"In surveys conducted in April, 64% of Latino adults who had not been vaccinated said they were worried the side effects would keep them from work. Fifty-five percent of Black adults said the same, while the share among white adults was 41%."
business,"However, the actual policies vary from one company to the next, and some employers have offered no carrot at all."
business,"Some of the least generous paid leave policies are found in fields that disproportionately employ Latinos, like construction, food service and agriculture."
business,"Three-quarters of private-sector U.S. workers get paid sick days, but paid time off is far more widespread in higher-paying, white-collar industries, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. For jobs in the bottom 25% of average wages, less than half of workers get paid sick days. For jobs in the bottom 10%, less than one-third of workers get them. "
business,"Not surprisingly, the concern is particularly acute among Latinos who may be undocumented. Nearly three-quarters of those adults said they were concerned about potential side effects keeping them from their jobs. Undocumented workers tend to have less bargaining power at work due to their immigration status, and they often fear upsetting their employers."
business,"Some employers have given workers half or full paid days off to get vaccinated, or offered a one-time bonus for those who show proof of vaccination, including in low-wage fields like retail and the grocery industry. The American Rescue Plan recently passed by Congress offers tax credits to companies with fewer than 500 employees who provide paid leave for vaccinations."
business,"Kaiser noted that these racial discrepancies track with clear inequities in paid leave, since Latino and Black workers are more likely to be in low-wage jobs with skimpy benefits: “They have less flexibility to take time off work and, if they do miss work, they often face lost wages that may leave them in a difficult financial situation.”"
business,"In the Kaiser surveys, 54% of unvaccinated Latinos said they would be more likely to get the shot if they had paid time off to cover the appointment and any side effects. Being given a flat $200 stipend also made vaccination more attractive, though for only 38%, suggesting paid time off work would be more effective. "
business,"Nearly half of adults have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, but many of those who are most eager and able to get vaccinated have already done so. In general, the most socially vulnerable counties in the U.S. tend to have lower vaccination rates, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "
business,The findings come at a time when the pace of vaccinations around the U.S. has been slowing after an encouraging rollout. 
business,"WASHINGTON (AP) — After much delay, senators unveiled a nearly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package, wrapping up days of painstaking work on the inches-thick bill and launching what is certain to be a lengthy debate over President Joe Biden’s big priority."
business,"“We haven’t done a large, bipartisan bill of this nature in a long time,” said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. He said a final vote could be held “in a matter of days.”"
business,"A key part of Biden’s agenda, the bipartisan bill is the first phase of the president’s infrastructure plan. It calls for $550 billion in new spending over five years above projected federal levels, what could be one of the more substantial expenditures on the nation’s roads, bridges, waterworks, broadband and the electric grid in years."
business,"Senators and staff labored behind the scenes for days to write the massive bill. It was supposed to be ready Friday, but by Sunday even more glitches were caught and changes made. To prod the work, Schumer kept senators in session over the weekend, encouraging the authors to finish up work."
business,"The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act clocked in at some 2,700 pages, and senators could begin amending it soon. Despite the hurry-up-and-wait during a rare weekend session, emotions bubbled over once the bill was produced Sunday night. The final product was not intended to stray from the broad outline senators had negotiated for weeks with the White House."
business,"The spending is broadly popular among lawmakers, bringing long-delayed capital for big-ticket items that cites and states can rarely afford on their own."
business,"“We know that this has been a long and sometimes difficult process, but we are proud this evening to announce this legislation,” said Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., a lead negotiator. The bill showed “we can put aside our own political differences for the good of the country,” she said."
business,"Over the long weekend of starts and stops, Schumer repeatedly warned that he was prepared to keep lawmakers in Washington for as long as it took to complete votes on both the bipartisan infrastructure plan as well as a budget blueprint that would allow the Senate to begin work later this year on a massive, $3.5 trillion social, health and environmental bill."
business,Republican negotiator Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio said the final product will be “great for the American people.”
business,"Among the major new investments, the bipartisan package is expected to provide $110 billion for roads and bridges, $39 billion for public transit and $66 billion for rail. There’s also set to be $55 billion for water and wastewater infrastructure as well as billions for airports, ports, broadband internet and electric vehicle charging stations."
business,"Late Sunday night, most of the 10 senators involved in the bipartisan effort rose on the Senate floor to mark the moment."
business,"Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, predicted: “It’s going to be a grind.”"
business,"Paying for the package has been a challenge after senators rejected ideas to raise revenue from a new gas tax or other streams. Instead, it is being financed from funding sources that might not pass muster with deficit hawks, including repurposing some $205 billion in untapped COVID-19 relief aid, as well as unemployment assistance that was turned back by some states and relying on projected future economic growth."
business,"Bipartisan support from Republican and Democratic senators pushed the process along, and Schumer wanted the voting to be wrapped up before senators left for the August recess."
business,"Last week week, 17 GOP senators joined all Democrats in voting to start work on the bipartisan bill. That support largely held, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., voting yes in another procedural vote to nudge the process along in the 50-50 Senate, where 60 votes are needed to overcome a filibuster an advance legislation."
business,"“I’ve got real concerns with this bill,” said Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah."
business,Cornyn said he expects Schumer to allow all senators to have a chance to shape the bipartisan bill and allow for amendments from members of both parties.
business,Whether the number of Republican senators willing to pass the bill grows or shrinks in the days ahead will determine if the president’s signature issue can make it across the finish line.
business,"“I hope we can now pump the brakes a little bit and take the time and care to evaluate the benefits and the cost of this legislation,” Cornyn said."
business,"The bipartisan bill still faces a rough road in the House, where progressive lawmakers want a more robust package but may have to settle for this one to keep Biden’s infrastructure plans on track."
business,Associated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Brian Slodysko contributed to this report.
business,"The outcome with the bipartisan effort will set the stage for the next debate over Biden’s much more ambitious $3.5 trillion package, a strictly partisan pursuit of far-reaching programs and services including child care, tax breaks and health care that touch almost every corner of American life. Republicans strongly oppose that bill, which would require a simple majority for passage. Final votes on that measure are not expected until fall."

business,"Wages and benefits for U.S. workers have been rising quickly as vaccinations increase and employers try to meet growing demand at restaurants and other businesses.

For frontline workers earning around $12 or $13 an hour, that amounted to a pay boost of a dollar and change."
business,"Chipotle CEO Brian Niccol got a raise, too ― from $33.5 million to $38 million ― after the company’s board waived performance rules that would have dragged down his compensation for the year. Niccol ended up reaping nearly 3,000 times the annual $13,127 pay of Chipotle’s median worker."
business,"The haul for Niccol is one of several CEO pay packages highlighted in a new report from the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank, showing how companies tweaked their compensation rules during the pandemic to keep executive pay high as regular workers struggled. The report analyzed pay data from Carnival Cruise Line, fast-food giant Yum Brands, Coca-Cola and Olive Garden parent company Darden Restaurants, among others."
business,"Sarah Anderson, who co-authored the report with Sam Pizzigati, found that of the 100 S&P 500 companies with the lowest median worker pay, more than half “bent their own rules” last year to jack up their executives’ paychecks. She said many of them cited the need to “retain” talented CEOs."
business,"“It’s part of this whole ‘great man theory ... if we don’t bend over backwards and pay these guys outrageous sums, they will abandon ship even in the middle of a national crisis,’” Anderson said in an interview. “The whole retention justification has always seemed absurd to me, but it’s even more absurd in a year when frontline employees have proved how essential they are.”"
business,"Chipotle announced this week that it would be hiking its minimum wage to $15 per hour as it looks to expand its workforce. A company spokesperson said in a statement that Niccol’s 2020 pay was based on “a competitive analysis of CEO pay levels,” and that the payout includes “a one-time modification that is not reflective of his ongoing pay package.” "
business,"Without that one-off change, the ratio of Niccol’s pay to the median Chipotle worker’s would be a more modest 1,129 to 1, the spokesperson noted."
business,"“Under Brian’s leadership, Chipotle’s stock has increased more than 300% and the market cap grew $30.6 billion, from $8.2 billion in early 2018 to $38.8 billion at the end of 2020,” the spokesperson said. "
business,"Among the 51 companies included in the report, CEO pay averaged more than $15 million in 2020, a 29% increase over the previous year, while the median worker pay came to $28,187, reflecting a 2% decrease. The average CEO-to-worker pay ratio for those same employers was 830 to 1. "
business,"The company with the lowest median wages in the report was auto-parts maker Aptiv, at $5,906, followed by apparel giant Under Armour, at $6,669. Both companies would have a significant share of workers overseas, where wages tend to be lower than in the U.S. The CEO pay last year was $31.3 million at Aptiv and $7.4 million at Under Armour. Both companies adjusted performance metrics to raise executive pay, according to the report."
business,"Due to a change in reporting rules brought on by the Dodd-Frank Act, public companies must now disclose those ratios in reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission so investors can get a better handle on the pay disparities between executives and typical workers."
business,"Hilton said in a statement that the figure was misleading. Nassetta’s take-home pay was really $20.1 million, a spokesperson said, but the amount appeared inflated due to complicated maneuvers with stock awards. "
business,"Some companies that suffered significant losses during the pandemic still managed to reward executives handsomely. Hotel giant Hilton lost $720 million on the year, but CEO Chris Nassetta received a compensation package worth $55.9 million, according to the company’s SEC filing."
business,"“For additional context, 93.5% of Chris’ pay is directly tied to company performance and is in no way guaranteed,” a spokesperson said in an email. “In the last five years, he led Hilton as it delivered $20 billion of shareholder value at rates that were significantly better than our peers and competitors.”"
business,Anderson said Hilton’s objection to the value of Nassetta’s pay showed how convoluted some packages were.
business,"“The complexity was really something,” Anderson said. “They clearly devoted enormous brainpower to devising this plan.”"
business,"National Transportation Safety Board investigators said in a preliminary report Monday that the owner of a Tesla was in the driver’s seat shortly before the car hit a tree in Texas and burst into flames last month, killing both occupants."
business,"Footage from a “home security camera shows the owner entering the car’s driver’s seat and the passenger entering the front passenger seat,” the NTSB report noted. The Tesla Model S traveled only 550 feet — about two blocks — before crashing into the tree on April 17 in suburban Houston, the report added."
business,"The car was equipped with Tesla’s optional Autopilot automated steering feature, but data that would reveal whether the system was engaged was damaged by the fire, according to the NTSB. Officials emphasized that the NTSB report is preliminary and subject to change as the probe continues."
business,"Harris County is continuing its separate investigation into the crash. A Harris County constable said earlier that no one was in the driver’s seat when firefighters arrived to douse the flaming wreckage, raising fresh questions about Tesla’s Autopilot system."
business,The owner of the 2019 Tesla Model S and a friend were overheard by their wives talking about trying out the Autopilot as they left the owner’s home for a drive.
business,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk has insisted that the car could not have been driverlessbecause the Autopilot had not been engaged. Musk said the system couldn’t have been on because the car was traveling on a road that lacked marked lane lines, which Autopilot requires to work."
business,"
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has begun 27 investigations — with 23 ongoing — into crashes that may have involved Tesla’s Autopilot feature. Musk has largely downplayed concerns about Autopilot, and has insisted it makes the cars safer by helping drivers.
"
business,"
Although Tesla warns drivers not to take their hands off the steering wheel when the car is operating on Autopilot, drivers have been known to fall asleep at the wheel, read or text, or stop paying attention to the road when using the feature.
"
business,"“Autopilot is intended for use with a fully attentive driver, who has their hands on the wheel and is prepared to take over at any time,” the Tesla website states. The “currently enabled features do not make the vehicle autonomous.”A video featured on Tesla’s site shows a cruising car with the driver’s hands in his lap. A message notes that the “person in the driver’s seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself.”
Tesla could not immediately be reached for comment on the NTSB report. The company eliminated its public relations department last year."
business,"“The last time we were tracking union labor, it was something like 3% of the overall workforce,” Ed Gilliland, the foundation’s senior director, told HuffPost in 2019. “It was a small number. We think it’s probably still pretty small.”"
business,"Sales jobs, which historically make up the third-largest portion of solar employment, suffered the biggest hit, dropping over 12%. Jobs in manufacturing ― the second-largest employment sector, which the Trump administration attempted to boost with trade tariffs on imported panels ― fell more than 9%. Installation jobs, which make up the lion’s share of solar employment, decreased just over 4%. "
business,"Every year, the industry-backed Solar Foundation puts out a job census based on surveys of companies manufacturing, selling and installing photovoltaic panels across the country. For the past several years, the annual report has excluded how many solar workers belong to unions. "
business,"So when the group compiled its survey results this year, Gilliland reached a surprising conclusion: More than 10% of the industry had now unionized. "
business,"Bigger-than-expected union representation offers one of the more optimistic conclusions of the latest report, out Thursday, which largely takes stock of the damage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, 231,474 people worked in the U.S. solar industry, a 6.7% decrease from 2019."
business,"Gilliland said unionization varies state by state, depending on the kind of labor provisions set out in government contracts and how favorable state law is to organizing workplaces. "
business,"“Unionization has a lot to do with state policies and state licensing requirements, and obviously in some states there’s a very low union representation,” he told HuffPost on Tuesday. “In others, you’re looking at Minnesota or Washington, there’s very high union representation.” "
business,"It’s difficult to estimate the significance of the unionization rate, in part because this year’s job census used a more rigorous methodology to determine that data point than in years past, meaning annual comparisons are tenuous. "
business,"Still, the national trends around compensation offer a bullish look at where the industry may be headed. Construction managers, operations managers, maintenance workers and sales representatives all make more money on average in the solar industry than in other energy industries, including natural gas, oil, wind, nuclear and hydropower, the census found. Electrical engineers and electricians still make more working at other energy projects than solar ones, but only just slightly. Solar installers make just under what the average roofer earns. "
business,"How unionization affects compensation is “still state by state,” Gilliland said. “But the strong union states are going to see this as favorable for the industry and for the wages the industry pays.” "
business,"Solar has long employed a disproportionate number of veterans, who made up 8.7% of the industry last year, compared to 5.7% of the overall economy. Within the last five years, the number of women in the solar industry increased by 39%, and Latino workers saw even bigger gains (92%), as did Black workers (73%)."
business,"“The solar industry continues to support hundreds of thousands of jobs across all 50 states, and even during a pandemic, our companies largely were able to keep workers on the job,” Abigail Ross Hopper, president and chief executive of SEIA, said in a statement. “We now have an opportunity to quadruple our workforce.”"
business,"In 2018, United Airlines’ catering workers in five cities voted to unionize by an overwhelming margin. Two and a half years later, they still have not secured a contract, and the airline may outsource their jobs."
business,"If the Biden administration achieves two of its biggest legislative goals, the industry could go gangbusters. The Protecting the Right to Organize Act — the most ambitious labor bill Democrats have advanced in decades — would upend the right-to-work laws that hamstring efforts to unionize new industries in conservative-leaning states. And the 100% Clean Energy Standard that the White House has vowed to pass to buttress its climate plans would require some 400,000 solar workers by 2030 — and 900,000 by 2035, according to estimates from the Solar Energy Industries Association, which co-authored the census. "
business,"United has issued a request for bids from contractors interested in taking on the airline’s kitchen work at its hubs in Cleveland, Denver, Houston, Honolulu and Newark. The company has not committed to requiring any potential contractors to retain the workers or to bargain with their union, though it says it would work to prioritize the current workforce for new positions. "
business,"A United spokesperson said the airline hasn’t made a final decision yet on outsourcing, which it first proposed in January, and no changes would come until late this year at the earliest."
business,"The finding, coupled with a rosy picture of wages compared to other energy sectors, could become a useful talking point for President Joe Biden as his administration angles to supercharge the transition away from fossil fuels and give union organizers their biggest legal boost in decades. It comes just weeks after the nation’s biggest coal-mining union announced it would support climate legislation that promises its workers new clean-energy jobs. "
business,"Yet even though solar installations picked up again in the second half of last year, employment has not returned to pre-pandemic levels. That could indicate “efficiency gains” in the industry, as the pandemic made online sales routine and permanently diminished the need for door-to-door salespeople. "
business,"But Unite Here, which represents the workers, is concerned that many might lose their jobs."
business,He views the outsourcing overture as a way for United to avoid dealing with the union’s demands for better pay and benefits.
business,"Joseph Alcantara, who drives a truck that loads meals onto United flights at the Cleveland airport, supported the union effort because he believes United should pay higher wages. After six years, he earns $14.79 per hour doing a job that he says is dangerous due to the heights at which he works."
business,"“It’s not right the way they’ve treated us,” Alcantara told HuffPost. “Now they just don’t want to pay the workers. They want to get rid of us.”"
business,"If United chooses to outsource the kitchen work, it would be following in the footsteps of other major carriers that have offloaded food preparation onto outside firms. Companies often contract out certain functions to focus their attention on so-called core competencies, though such outsourcing often results in lower pay and less desirable working conditions."
business,"The airline industry has had a tumultuous year since travel nearly came to a halt at the start of the pandemic. But U.S. airlines are optimistic about the months ahead, with increased vaccinations and more stimulus spending leading to a jump in bookings. As of Wednesday, United’s stock price was more than double what it was a year ago. "
business,"In 2018, United’s kitchen workers ultimately voted 1,253 to 486 in favor of the union, a resounding 72-28 margin. Many workers celebrated the successful campaign in part because the rest of United’s frontline workforce — including flight attendants and ramp agents — was already organized. Alcantara saw the victory as a way to get the caterers “their fair share.”"
business,"Now Unite Here is accusing the company of not bargaining in good faith and trying to avoid reaching a first contract. The union said that, after more than two years, United still has not made an economic offer that would cover wages and basic benefits, even as the company is soliciting bids from outside firms. "
business,"Getting to that point was not easy. United managed to postpone the election for months after accusing the union of misrepresenting itself to workers during the organizing campaign, prompting an investigation by the National Mediation Board, the federal agency that oversees collective bargaining in the airline industry. The board’s general counsel dismissed the claims and ordered the election to move ahead."
business,"Marlene Patrick-Cooper, president of Unite Here Local 23 (which represents the catering workers), said the notices the airline sent employees about the potential outsourcing of their jobs was part of a broader pattern of “anti-union” behavior. She called it “brazen” that the company might avoid a union contract after accepting billions in government bailout funds for the airline industry."
business,"“It’s all about bad-faith bargaining,” she said. “They’re creating all-out war by sending these letters to our people.”"
business,The airline argues that soliciting contractor bids is about the pandemic. 
business,"“Given the unprecedented impact of COVID-19 on our business, United continues to explore ways to do things differently and become more efficient wherever we can,” the company spokesperson told HuffPost."
business,"“We did not take these actions to increase their stock prices. We took these actions to keep workers on the payroll,” Payne said. “That was our initial goal. Now that the economy is improving, they want to outsource.”"
business,"United has received $7.7 billion in payroll support through congressional coronavirus relief programs passed under former President Donald Trump, with another roughly $2.4 billion to come in another the stimulus passed under President Joe Biden, according to the Financial Times. Although United will owe the government roughly $3 billion of that money, most of it won’t have to be paid back if United meets the law’s conditions on retaining workers. "
business,"United said any outsourcing plan it pursues would comply with the law. But even if the airline follows those requirements, some Democrats in Congress say it should not be outsourcing work after accepting government money to get through the pandemic. In a letter to United’s chief executive, Scott Kirby, this week, lawmakers said the company should “adhere to the spirit” of the payroll protection program, and ditch “any plan that would outsource thousands of jobs when the industry is already projecting financial recovery.”"
business,"In an online press conference Wednesday, Rep. Donald Payne Jr. (D-N.J.), who represents Newark, said the major airlines are rebounding in large part because of the government help that got them through the worst of the pandemic."
business,"Many airline workers have been furloughed or seen their hours reduced during the pandemic. Alcantara is still working 20 hours a week at the Cleveland airport, as opposed to the full-time schedule he had before lockdown. He recently took a second job driving a truck and handling store displays for Coca-Cola."
business,"“A lot of workers took a sacrifice,” Alcantara said. “Right now we’re scared, we’re in limbo, and we don’t know what’s going to happen.” "
business,"He said he hopes that if his United job is outsourced he will be given preference for a new position based on his seniority, and that his union will still be recognized by the new employer. He said some of his colleagues have been working their jobs for 20 years and don’t know what they’ll do if they lose them."

One of the largest jewelry-makers in the world is pivoting away from mined diamonds in favor of more sustainable lab-grown diamonds.
Pandora CEO Alexander Lacik revealed this week that the company would be ceasing its participation in selling mined diamonds because “it’s the right thing to do.”
“We can essentially create the same outcome as nature has created, but at a very, very different price,” he told the BBC, adding that lab-grown diamonds can be made for as little as “a third of what it is for something that we’ve dug up from the ground.”
Lacik emphasized that with the lower price point, he believes more people will buy diamonds even though the company’s diamond sales are only a very small portion of the 100 million pieces the brand sells each year.
The Copenhagen-based company is slated to release its first collection featuring the lab-made stones in the U.K. first and enter other markets in 2022.
"
business,"
The shift from mined diamonds to lab-grown versions reflects a cultural shift as more and more consumers want to know where their products come from. Diamond mining has long been known as a problematic industry with meandering supply chains that render it difficult to impossible to trace retail diamonds’ origins, often resulting in conflict diamonds entering the market.
In 2019, luxury jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co. led the transparency charge in the industry, announcing that it would begin sharing with consumers the provenance of its diamonds.
Calling it the Diamond Source Initiative, the brand traces each of its “individually registered diamonds (0.18 carats and larger) by a unique ‘T&Co’ serial number etched by laser and invisible to the naked eye, and providing consumers geographic sourcing information specific to their diamond.” The idea is to ensure that all of their diamonds are “among the most responsibly sourced in the world.”

business,Tesla CEO and SpaceX founder Elon Musk has tweeted that he’s sending a satellite named after Dogecoin to the moon after his jokes about it on “Saturday Night Live” misfired and sent his favorite cryptocurrency plunging in value.
business,"“SpaceX launching satellite Doge-1 to the moon next year,” Musk tweeted Sunday. The mission will be “paid for in Doge,” noted the quirky entrepreneur, who now likes to call himself the “Dogefather.”"
business,Musk vowed his launch will represent the “1st crypto in space” and the “1st meme in space.”
business,"Investors in Dogecoin, which is represented by a shiba inu dog and was initially founded as a joke mocking cryptocurrency, were hopeful that Musk would send Dogecoin values soaring with a plug during his appearance on “Saturday Night Live” last week. Values in the past have rocketed with a mention by Musk."
business,"Instead, its value plunged nearly 30% that night, apparently hurt by Musk’s typically reckless comments."
business,"In one “SNL” bit on “Weekend Update,” Musk played a financial expert trying poorly to explain the cryptocurrency. “Update” co-anchor Michael Che asked him repeatedly: “What is Dogecoin?” Finally, Che asked: “So it’s a hustle?” and Musk replied: “Yeah, it’s a hustle,” and smiled. "

social justice,"As Mayra Raymundo drives to work each evening, she obsessively checks her rearview mirror. She’s terrified a cop will pull her over and find out she doesn’t have a driver’s license or car insurance. She would have to admit she is undocumented, risking deportation to Guatemala."
social justice,"This story is co-published with the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit investigative news organization in Washington, D.C."
social justice,"Raymundo, 31, works nights cleaning a private school outside Providence, Rhode Island. She earns $11.50 an hour. Without a car, Raymundo said she can’t earn a living to support her two young daughters."
social justice,"“Basically, if you have a car, you can find work. If not, then no,” said Raymundo, adding that she could land a job that pays $15 an hour if she had a driver’s license. “Without a license, I live in constant fear.”"
social justice,"Raymundo and two of her co-workers, also undocumented, said they prayed for state lawmakers to approve a bill that would allow them to obtain licenses. Rhode Island legislators have tried to pass this bill for more than 10 years."
social justice,"Sixteen states, plus Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., allow undocumented immigrants to receive driver’s licenses or similar IDs known as driving privilege cards, eliminating the chance of arrest for driving without a license, a common fast-track to deportation. More places are considering this approach, as research shows earlier adopters reduced the likelihood of hit-and-run accidents, lowered insurance costs for drivers, increased the number of insured motorists on roads and improved poverty rates."
social justice,But immigration authorities are using driver’s license data to find the very people who are supposed to benefit from the new laws.
social justice,"Agents often say these immigrants are suspects in crimes, but sometimes agents are searching for people they believe committed only a civil immigration infraction, such as overstaying a visa."
social justice,"At least seven states have shared personal information from drivers with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since January 2020, according to a Center for Public Integrity investigation. Sometimes, immigration agents will ask motor vehicle agency staff to run a facial recognition search to match a provided photo. Other times, they seek addresses and driving records for specific people."
social justice,"Some of the other jurisdictions — like Washington, D.C. — did not share privacy policies but said they are committed to protecting drivers’ personal information. And ICE said it does not use license information to target people to deport."
social justice,Some immigrant rights groups now question whether it’s too risky for undocumented immigrants to get licenses.
social justice,"Most don’t require proof that ICE investigations relate to criminal activity rather than civil immigration infractions. When ICE requests cite child exploitation, drug trafficking or other such investigations, these states grant them, taking them at face value."
social justice,"Public Integrity asked every jurisdiction that allows undocumented individuals to drive how they handle requests from ICE. Their laws or internal policies varied widely, and some refused to explain them."
social justice,But Public Integrity found that ICE has requested information solely for immigration enforcement in some cases over the last year and a half. And advocates say they doubt jurisdictions can be sure the agency won’t use driver’s license data to track down undocumented immigrants who have committed no crimes.
social justice,"“There’s still a lot of work to do to ensure information is protected,” said Mayra Cedano, executive director of Comunidades Unidas, a Utah nonprofit that works closely with undocumented families. “A lot of folks in our communities said, ‘I won’t risk it. I won’t renew to risk being deported just to drive.’”"
social justice,"Only four states — New Jersey, New Mexico, Virginia and Washington — require ICE agents to produce a court order or arrest warrant signed by a judge before handing over someone’s personal data. At least two other states — California and Hawaii — passed laws explicitly prohibiting motor vehicle departments from sharing information solely related to immigration enforcement with ICE."
social justice,"“You have to trust that ICE has internal safeguards in place, that they won’t use the information for immigration,” said Diane Burkley Alejandro, lead advocate for ACLU People Power Fairfax. “But does it happen? … Who knows.”"
social justice,"Some States Verify ICE’s Requests, But Many Do Not"
social justice,"In California, for instance, a DMV spokesperson said ICE “must agree” not to use personal information for immigration enforcement. The DMV counts on ICE to follow these rules and granted all 141 requests from the agency in the last year and a half."
social justice,"In Utah, which has a similar policy, Comunidades Unidas’ Cedano said some undocumented immigrants’ fears about what the government will do with their information has kept them from applying for driving privilege cards. The 31,000 people with driving cards last year, according to data from the Utah Department of Public Safety, represent a drop of about 7,000 in the past decade."
social justice,"ICE accessed Maryland’s law enforcement database – which contains drivers’ personal information – over 4,800 times in the past year and a half. ICE also conducted 37 facial recognition searches through the state’s Image Repository System. Maryland did not clarify how many of these incidents involved drivers’ license data, again referring the question to Homeland Security."
social justice,"Delaware and Vermont, meanwhile, allow their motor vehicle departments to give information to ICE solely for immigration enforcement."
social justice,"“It shouldn’t be a risk to get a driver’s license. ... It makes me mad that people will have to think about data, that their information can be given to ICE,” said Juan Manuel Guzman, state advocacy director of the youth-led immigrant rights group United We Dream. He said he got his license in Maryland in 2014 when the state allowed undocumented immigrants to do so."
social justice,"And in Oregon and Maryland, ICE can directly access statewide law enforcement databases, including driving records. No request required."
social justice,"A spokesperson for the Oregon State Police, which manages the statewide law enforcement database, did not answer repeated questions about whether the state prohibits ICE from accessing data for investigations that do not involve criminal activity. Maryland’s Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services referred that question to ICE’s parent, the Department of Homeland Security. ICE did not respond to a request for comment about that."
social justice,"“Whenever you give agencies — it could be ICE, it could be the CIA — free rein and unchecked power, they can go through so much data and use it dangerously,” he said. “I think it’s extremely concerning.”"
social justice,"As more states began permitting undocumented immigrants to drive, federal immigration authorities began contacting state motor vehicle departments to help identify someone in a photo or to see if a person was living under an alias."
social justice,ICE Pursues Drivers’ Information
social justice,"In May 2020, ICE published a report claiming it has a policy against agents requesting facial recognition searches unless they involve people suspected of criminal activity. The report says ICE supervisors regularly review these requests."
social justice,"Colorado’s DMV received nine ICE requests related only to immigration enforcement in 2020, denying all of them."
social justice,"A spokesperson for ICE declined to say whether this is a new policy and, if so, when it went into effect. He said the agency does not make these requests simply to target individuals for deportation."
social justice,"“Like other law enforcement agencies, ICE may use DMV data in support of ongoing criminal investigations, or to confirm information regarding individuals who are considered a priority for the agency,” Mike Alvarez, the spokesperson, said in an email."
social justice,But Public Integrity found that ICE requested information from at least three states’ motor vehicle departments for immigration enforcement — all after the date of the agency’s 2020 report.
social justice,"ICE requested an individual’s address history, criminal history, traffic violation history and a photograph in September 2020 from the Connecticut Intelligence Center, which stores personal data from the state’s department of motor vehicles. The person was suspected of entering the country illegally, which is a civil infraction. The center denied the request."
social justice,"A 2019 Washington Post investigation found that ICE and the FBI submitted thousands of facial recognition requests to state motor vehicle departments between 2015 and 2019. In Utah alone, dozens of searches were marked as having returned a “possible match.” It’s unclear how many of those requests involved criminal activity."
social justice,"In December 2020, ICE requested information from Washington state’s licensing department without stating the crime the individual allegedly committed. The department denied the request."
social justice,"For a handful of other states, including Maryland and Oregon, there’s no way to know."
social justice,"Utah’s Department of Public Safety’s public information officer, Lt. Nick Street, first told Public Integrity that ICE agents requested information solely for immigration enforcement at least twice in 2021, and DPS granted their requests. Street said the department believed the requests were related to “U visa inquiries,” in which undocumented immigrants are victims of crimes and help law enforcement investigate the activity."
social justice,"State Sen. Curt Bramble, a Utah Republican who sponsored the bill to grant driving privilege cards in that state in 2005, said it doesn’t bother him if ICE uses driver’s license data to track down undocumented immigrants. He said the driving cards benefit both undocumented community members, who can legally drive, and law enforcement, who can identify those breaking the law."
social justice,He said advocates have never contacted him to express concern over this information sharing with ICE.
social justice,Street later said these requests had to do with criminal activities aside from immigration enforcement. They were among almost 230 information requests from ICE that the public safety department granted in the past year and a half.
social justice,"“There’s a reason why in the federal code that the legal term is ‘illegal alien,’” Bramble said. “The individuals have chosen to violate our immigration laws.”"
social justice,"Better Lives, More Money"
social justice,"Karla Reyes, 34, is a mother of four and a chef at a Little Caesars in Virginia. Her husband, Rosendo Martinez, is a landscaper who recently received his driving privilege card."
social justice,"Allowing undocumented individuals to get driver’s licenses has economic benefits: Licensed drivers are more likely to purchase vehicles and other bigger-ticket items, including homes. More cars are registered and insured. With an increased ability to commute to better jobs, undocumented people can contribute more to the economy."
social justice,"Poverty declines at a faster rate in states with these policies, according to a 2016 report from Roger Williams University’s School of Law and Latino Policy Institute."
social justice,"Once she can drive, Castillo will no longer need $14 taxi rides to and from evening English classes four days a week. She will be able to take her son, who has Asperger’s syndrome, to local educational programs too inconvenient by public transportation, where he can socialize with other children his age."
social justice,"“My time does not belong to me,” Castillo said through an interpreter. “It feels like I don’t have feet.”"

social justice,"Guzman, the undocumented advocate who got his license in Maryland, said he was able to drive to community college and learn English in the evenings. His family got better job opportunities."
social justice,"“My family works in construction and cleans houses, and for us to be able to liberate ourselves from sometimes very abusive employers has been wonderful,” Guzman said. “They know you don’t have any other option, and it’s really awful when you don’t have another option.”"
social justice,Ovidia Castillo works as a housekeeper in Virginia. It takes an hour to get to the first house of the day: She doesn’t have a driving privilege card yet and must rely on her employer to get her there with up to five other women.
social justice,"He was paid $180 a day but got a $20 raise after he got his license. Now he makes $200 a day,” Reyes said through an interpreter."
social justice,"Castillo, 41, is a single mother to a 16-year-old son. She can’t wait to pass her driving safety course and start her own housekeeping business, gaining control of her schedule and more free time to spend with her son."
social justice,Getting licenses in order to learn English is a common theme in undocumented communities.
social justice,"In Virginia, undocumented immigrants tried for years to persuade state lawmakers to allow them to drive. The bill finally passed in April 2020, after Democrats gained control of the Legislature, and went into effect in January."
social justice,"The bill was first introduced years ago by a Republican who represents a conservative, rural area in southern Virginia. Marketed as an economic and safety incentive, the bill was proposed to ensure undocumented farmworkers could produce food for the state, said Monica Sarmiento, executive director of the Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights."
social justice,"Advocates celebrated when the law was passed. But they saw it as a first step because it didn’t place restrictions on sharing personal data. At the time, General Assembly leadership wasn’t in favor of such restrictions, said Alejandro, with ACLU People Power Fairfax."
social justice,"“It was then a strategic choice to listen to community members, who were telling us that they understood the risks and wanted licenses anyway,” Alejandro said. “It was better to have licenses without complete protection than to not have licenses at all.”"

social justice,"Immigration and Customs Enforcement should no longer detain most immigrants who are pregnant, nursing or have given birth within the past year under a new directive that reverses former President Donald Trump’s harsh policies. "
social justice,"There were 13 pregnant women in ICE custody as of Thursday who are now being considered for release, officials told The Washington Post. "
social justice,"The new memo to ICE officers from the agency’s acting director, Tae Johnson, states that “[g]enerally ICE should not detain, arrest or take into custody for an administrative violation of the immigration laws individuals known to be pregnant, postpartum or nursing unless release is prohibited by law or exceptional circumstances exist,” according to The Hill. "
social justice,"ICE has a long ― and concerning ― history of alleged mistreatment of pregnant detainees. Some have told lawyers they were denied timely treatment after having a miscarriage. The number of women who miscarried in ICE custody nearly doubled under Trump, the Daily Beast reported in 2019. People in detainment and doctors have also reported that women have been shackled during pregnancy and postpartum. "
social justice,The Biden guidance goes even further than the Obama policy by also including people who are within a year of giving birth or are nursing. 
social justice,"Johnson’s new memo bars the use of restraints on pregnant women, except in extreme circumstances. ICE officers must obtain permission from a superior to request detention of a pregnant or nursing immigrant, the memo states. It also orders the agency to collect and track data on pregnancy among detainees."
social justice,"During Trump’s crackdown on undocumented immigration, no presumption of release was offered for pregnant women. Trump did away with a Barack Obama-era directive for ICE to “generally” not detain pregnant women, barring “extraordinary circumstances or the requirement of mandatory detention.” "
social justice,The Hill first reported Friday on President Joe Biden’s administration’s memo with the new guidance. 
social justice,Women who enter ICE custody are routinely given a pregnancy test. 
social justice,"“ICE is committed to safeguarding the integrity of our immigration system and preserving the health and safety of pregnant, postpartum and nursing individuals,” Johnson said in a statement. “Given the unique needs of this population, we will not detain individuals known to be pregnant, postpartum or nursing unless release is prohibited by law or exceptional circumstances exist. This reflects our commitment to treat all individuals with respect and dignity while still enforcing our nation’s laws.”"
social justice,"Human rights groups applauded the decision, although they called for further steps to protect immigrants. Eunice Cho, senior staff attorney with the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, called the directive “a welcome step in the right direction.”"
social justice,"“This move brings us closer to more humane treatment by ICE of people who are pregnant, postpartum, or nursing,” Cho said in a statement. “ICE should stop detaining or arresting people who would be at particular risk in detention, must implement robust oversight of detention facilities, and ensure the release of all people who would be particularly vulnerable in detention.”"
social justice,"New York Yankees fans didn’t have much to cheer for on Monday night as the home team was drubbed by the Baltimore Orioles. But that briefly changed in the eighth inning, not because of the players, but because of a cat who interrupted play. "

social justice,The Justice Department sued the state of Texas on Friday over Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s executive order restricting the transportation of migrants.
social justice,"The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Texas, asks the court to declare the governor’s order invalid, saying it “causes injury” to people the federal government “is charged to protect, jeopardizing the health and safety” of migrants in federal custody. "
social justice,"The Biden administration’s lawsuit notes that the federal government often uses contractors who may not be law enforcement officials to transport migrants, including unaccompanied children, from Border Patrol to Health and Human Services facilities or to nonprofits where children stay until they can be reunified with family or other sponsors pending immigration proceedings. "
social justice,"Abbott’s executive order, issued Wednesday under the guise of concerns about COVID-19, prohibits anyone who isn’t a “federal, state, or local law-enforcement official” from transporting migrants released from federal custody. It also gives the state authority to stop and seize private vehicles suspected of carrying migrants."
social justice,"And migrants released by Border Patrol often use privately arranged transportation like buses or trains to get to where they’ll be staying as their cases move through immigration courts, the suit notes, as well as to get to ICE appointments or court appearances, as they must by law. "

social justice,"
CANTON, Ga. (AP) — A man accused of killing eight people, mostly women of Asian descent, at Atlanta-area massage businesses pleaded guilty to murder Tuesday in four of the killings and was sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison.
Robert Aaron Long, 22, still faces the death penalty in the other deaths, which are being prosecuted in another county. The string of shootings at three businesses in March ignited outrage and fueled fear among Asian Americans, who already faced increased hostility linked to the coronavirus pandemic. Many were particularly upset when authorities suggested Long’s crimes weren’t racially motivated but born of a sex addiction, which isn’t recognized as an official disorder.
Cherokee County prosecutors had planned to seek the death penalty but decided a plea deal would bring swift justice and avoid any lengthy appeals. That’s what the victims and their families who they were able to contact wanted, District Attorney Shannon Wallace said.
Bonnie Michels’ husband of 24 years, Paul, was the first person killed.
“A part of me died with him that day,” she told the judge. “I am shattered.”
Elcias Hernandez Ortiz, who was shot in the face, also addressed the court, saying it’s been very hard for his family.
“Honestly, this man, why didn’t he think before killing so many people? I only want justice,” he said through a Spanish translator.
On March 16, Long shot and killed four people, three of them women and two of Asian descent, at Youngs Asian Massage in Cherokee County. A fifth person was wounded. Long then drove to Atlanta, where he shot and killed three women at Gold Spa before crossing the street to Aromatherapy Spa and killing another woman, police said. All of the Atlanta victims were of Asian descent.
In Atlanta, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis has said she intends to seek the death penalty. There, Long faces charges of aggravated assault and domestic terrorism in addition to murder.
"
social justice,"“This was not any kind of hate crime,” Wallace said during the hearing."
social justice,"Investigators interviewed people who knew Long for years, including three of Asian descent, who said they’d never heard him make racist comments, she said. Her team also considered the diversity of the people shot in Cherokee County. They included a Hispanic man and a white man and woman."
social justice,"Asian American community leaders said Tuesday they were concerned that the shootings continue to be blamed on a sex addiction. Long’s crimes were “intended to target Asian people, specifically Asian women,” said state Rep. Bee Nguyen, the first Vietnamese American to serve in the Georgia House and a frequent advocate for women and communities of color."
social justice,"Wallace said she would have argued at trial that Long was motivated by gender bias, though that wouldn’t have extended his sentence."
social justice,"Prosecutors in Fulton County, where all the victims were women of Asian descent, have said they believe Long was motivated by race and gender. They plan to seek a hate crime sentencing enhancement."
social justice,"Georgia’s new hate crimes law doesn’t provide for a stand-alone hate crime. After a conviction on an underlying crime, a jury determines whether it was motivated by bias, which carries an additional penalty."
social justice,"The American Psychiatric Association doesn’t recognize sex addiction in its main reference guide for mental disorders. While some people struggle to control sexual behaviors, it’s often linked to recognized disorders or moral views, said David Ley, clinical psychologist and author of “The Myth of Sex Addiction.”"
social justice,"Long previously underwent inpatient and outpatient treatment for sex addiction, Wallace said. In fact, it was another patient who gave him the idea to seek sexual services at massage businesses, she said."
social justice,"Long signed a plea agreement admitting to all charges in Cherokee County, including malice murder, felony murder, attempt to commit murder and aggravated assault. Cherokee County Superior Court Chief Judge Ellen McElyea then handed him four sentences of life without parole plus an additional 35 years."
social justice,"Long said he planned to kill himself that day and went to the massage businesses thinking that paying for sex — which he considered shameful — would push him to do it. But while sitting in his car outside the first spa, he decided to kill the people inside."
social justice,"After he was caught in south Georgia, Long told detectives he struggled with pornography and sex. He believed he was an addict and felt tremendous guilt when he viewed porn or engaged in sexual acts at massage businesses, Wallace said."
social justice,"Those killed in Cherokee County: Michels, 54; Xiaojie “Emily” Tan, 49; Daoyou Feng, 44; and Delaina Yaun, 33. The Atlanta victims were: Suncha Kim, 69; Soon Chung Park, 74; Hyun Jung Grant, 51; and Yong Ae Yue, 63."
social justice,"Long blamed the victims for his inability to control his impulses, Wallace said."
social justice,Long is scheduled for arraignment next month in Fulton County. His Cherokee County lawyers said in a statement they hope prosecutors there will follow Wallace’s example and reach a similar plea agreement.
social justice,"Wallace said that after the shootings at the two Atlanta spas, Long intended to carry out similar crimes in Florida."
social justice,"By then, his parents had called authorities after recognizing their son in images from security video that authorities posted online. His parents were already tracking his movements through an application on his phone so they would know if he visited massage businesses, the prosecutor said, and that enabled officers to find him."

social justice,"“Needless to say, we never would have expected an incident like this to occur as the safety of our guests and crew members are always top of mind,” the owners said."
social justice,"The ship-shaped museum closed after the collapse but reopened for those with tickets on Tuesday, according to a post. The owners said the affected area has been blocked off, and they estimate it will take at least four weeks for the iceberg wall to be rebuilt."
social justice,"The Pigeon Forge Police Department said in a statement that the collapse appears to be accidental, the Knoxville News Sentinel reported."
social justice,"Cedar Bay Entertainment opened the attraction in 2010. The company has another Titanic museum in Branson, Missouri."
social justice,Guests receive boarding passes containing the names of actual passengers or crew members who were aboard the British passenger liner that sank in 1912 on its maiden voyage after hitting an iceberg.
social justice,"Visitors can see more than 400 Titanic artifacts, shovel “coal” in the boiler room and feel 28-degree water through self-guided tours, according to the attraction’s website."
social justice,"The first time The Boston Globe wrote about Nathan Allen, less than a year ago, it was a love story, describing his “perfectly executed” wedding proposal and a “marriage set against the backdrop of a killer pandemic.”"
social justice,"On Sunday, the Globe wrote about him a second time: Allen allegedly “executed” two Black people, in the words of the Suffolk County district attorney, in what was being investigated as a hate crime, before being gunned down by police."
social justice,"“Allen died Saturday after exchanging gunfire with a Winthrop police sergeant who had responded to the chaotic scene, which unfolded in front of terrified residents, including children,” the Globe reported."
social justice,"Rachel Rollins, the district attorney, announced investigators had found “troubling white supremacist rhetoric” handwritten by Allen. “This individual wrote about the superiority of the white race,” she said in a statement. “About whites being ‘apex predators.’ He drew swastikas.”"
social justice,"A law enforcement source told HuffPost these messages were found in “notebooks,” but wouldn’t elaborate further. It’s unclear where police found the notebooks."
social justice,"These days, perpetrators of such heinous crimes often leave behind evidence of their hatred online: racist posts on social media, trolling chats on Gab or 8chan, maybe even a “manifesto.”"
social justice,"The seaside Boston suburb of Winthrop is now home to yet another makeshift memorial for those killed in an alleged American hate crime, made up of flowers, candles and photos of the departed: Ramona Cooper, 60, an Air Force veteran, and David Green, 68, a retired Massachusetts state trooper. Another community is reeling, searching for answers for how this could have happened here, and also knowing that of course this could have happened here. This, when it happens, always happens to people and places it shouldn’t."
social justice,"But Allen’s digital footprint appears apolitical and mundane: an Instagram account full of pictures of his wife and their pet rabbit, Puff; a LinkedIn account describing a blossoming career as a physical therapist; and a Facebook account he used only one week ago to wish his wife a happy birthday."
social justice,"Of the dozens of his Facebook friends contacted by HuffPost — many of whom had made recent posts celebrating Pride, or showing support for Black Lives Matter — most didn’t respond or declined to talk about Allen. One acquaintance, who knew him from Wareham High School down on the South Shore, remembered him as “a pretty normal kid” with a family that “was very loving and sweet.” Another acquaintance said they were “blindsided” by the news of what he did."
social justice,"Only the Globe could find someone, one of Allen’s neighbors, who described him as a “little off.”"
social justice,"When a Globe reporter buzzed Allen’s apartment, “a woman answered a call from the building’s lobby, but quickly hung up,” the newspaper reported."
social justice,"“This shooter was married and employed,” Rollins said in her statement. “He had a Ph.D. and no criminal history. To all external sources he likely appeared unassuming. And then, yesterday afternoon he stole a box truck, crashed it into another vehicle and a property, walked away from the wreckage interacting with multiple individuals and choosing only to shoot and kill the two Black people he encountered.”"
social justice,"In a press conference Monday, Rollins emphasized that Allen was “working alone” and that there is no longer a threat. He had a license to carry a firearm, but had not been on law enforcement’s radar prior to the attack. “He had nothing in his background check,” Rollins said."
social justice,"The district attorney’s office is thus far keeping the full contents of Allen’s notebooks from the public. Of the information it has released, perhaps the most unique or idiosyncratic detail is that Allen described white people as “apex predators.”"
social justice,"Researchers at Western States Center, a civil rights organization that monitors extremists, alerted HuffPost this week that on the morning of the shooting in Winthrop, there was a mention of “apex predator” in a post in an influential far-right channel on Telegram, a messaging app frequented by extremists."
social justice,"The post, written by an anonymous administrator of the “Boogaloo Intel Drop” channel, reacted with anger to the recent sentencing of Derek Chauvin — the white former police officer who murdered George Floyd in Minneapolis last year, setting off a wave of anti-racist protests across the country — to 23 years in prison."
social justice,"“Skip the bullshit and buy ammo, get right with God, learn to become the apex predator nonwhites used to fear and respect,” the user wrote."
social justice,"Later that day, a few hours after Allen allegedly shot and killed Cooper and Green in Winthrop, an administrator for the “Boogaloo Intel Drop” channel announced that they would “no longer post anything to this channel, but it will be maintained for archive purposes.” It seemed a sudden and surprising announcement. The channel had been a fixture in the far-right ecosystem for a while, with The Intercept noting that it had over 6,600 members as of Jan. 6."
social justice,"Reached for comment, an admin claimed the “Boogaloo Intel Drop channel” was abandoned because it had been “banned on Google and IOS devices” and that it would continue to “serve as a backup and archive for our other channel.”"
social justice,"Stephen Piggott, a program analyst at the Western States Center, thinks it’s possible Allen may have made the “apex predator” post. "
social justice,It’s also possible that Allen was in the channel and just saw the post that morning. 
social justice,"For the time being, there is no evidence directly connecting Allen to the “apex predator” post in the Boogaloo Intel Drop channel. (The district attorney’s office didn’t respond to a request for comment as to whether the Telegram post was part of its investigation.) Although the phrase has been used in neo-Nazi message boards before, it’s not all that common."
social justice,"Cooper, the Air Force veteran, worked at the local Veterans Affairs office and was a “caring and selfless” woman, her son told WCVB NewsCenter 5."
social justice,"As time passes, the details of what led Allen to steal a truck, crash it into a house and then kill two people will likely come into focus. For now, his alleged hate crime is the latest in a horrifying string of far-right murders. Since 2015, according to an analysis from The Washington Post,there have been 267 plots or attacks by far-right extremists in America, leading to 91 deaths."
social justice,"Green, the retired state trooper, whose neighbor described him as “sweet and kind” to Boston 25 News, reportedly spent the last moments of his life running to the scene where the truck crashed into the house, wanting to help."
social justice,"“If the shooter posted the message, it would point to a clear motive for the attack,” he told HuffPost. “The message is essentially a call for white people to launch a race war. If the shooter was the author, the post can be read as a short-form manifesto.”"
social justice,"“Farmworkers are imperiled by a perfect storm of deadly plagues: Extreme summer temperatures fueled by climate change… field workers disproportionately afflicted by the coronavirus… and too many live in daily dread of deportation, afraid to complain about abuse and mistreatment due to their immigration status,” said Teresa Romero, president of the United Farm Workers union, in a press call Thursday. "
social justice,"Farmworkers are calling on Congress to pass basic safety standards to protect them from extreme heat after a heat wave in the Pacific Northwest killed hundreds of people, including an undocumented worker in Oregon."
social justice,"As temperatures soared above 100 degrees in Washington, Oregon and California amid a record-breaking heat wave last week, hundreds died from the heat. Sebastian Francisco Perez, a Guatemalan undocumented farmworker in St. Paul, Oregon, was one of them."
social justice,"“We’re tired of going to vigils and funerals for those who have died,” Romero said. “The time for action is now.”"
social justice,"Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) enacted temporary emergency rules Tuesday, requiring employers to provide shade, water and breaks to outdoor workers — but advocates want such protections to be permanent, and nationwide. "
social justice,"There is currently no federal standard for working conditions during extreme heat. Only three states — California, Washington and Minnesota — have regulations to protect workers from heat."
social justice,"Earlier this year, Democrats introduced the Asunción Valdivia Heat Illness and Fatality Prevention Act, which would ensure basic rights like access to water and paid breaks in the shade. It was named in honor of Asunción Valdivia, a California farmworker who died in 2004 after picking grapes for 10 hours straight in 105-degree temperatures."
social justice,"Most of the nation’s 2.4 million farmworkers are undocumented, and their lack of legal immigration status makes them more vulnerable to workplace abuses, as they’re more hesitant to make demands of their employers. "
social justice,"Many farmworkers also only get paid for what they pick, rather than a steady rate per hour, making them reluctant to take time off or even breaks out of fear of losing much-needed pay, said Bruce Goldstein, the president of advocacy group Farmworker Justice."
social justice,"In Oregon, an average annual salary for a farmworker can come out to $19,000 to $24,000 per year — less than minimum wage, according to Reyna Lopez, executive director of farmworker group Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste. "
social justice,"Leticia, an undocumented farmworker in Washington who spoke on Thursday’s press call, said that she’s been working for over 14 years picking cherries, apples, pears and grapes. Last week, she was out in the fields in temperatures around 115 degrees. "
social justice,"While her employer gave workers the choice to finish the day early, it was the workers who decided together to break once they couldn’t handle the heat anymore — “if it were up to the farmers, probably we would have kept working,” Leticia said, explaining that they didn’t have enough water or shade to not risk their health."
social justice,"Democrats introduced bills to fast-track citizenship for undocumented essential workers and provide a pathway to citizenship to farmworkers specifically. But with only a slim Democratic majority in the Senate, it’s unclear if these efforts can pass. "
social justice,"“Us farmworkers are often scared to demand our rights because of our immigration status,” the mother of four said. “We’re scared they’re going to cut our hours or even lose our jobs.” "
social justice,"“They call us ‘essential,’” Leticia said, referring to the term to describe those who kept working as millions stayed home in the pandemic. “We wake up at 2 or 3 in the morning to harvest the food you put on your tables. We’re asking Congress: We deserve a pathway to citizenship.” "
social justice,A federal judge in Texas ruled Friday that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program ― a policy that lets undocumented immigrants who were brought into the U.S. as minors stay in the country ― is illegal and must be suspended.
social justice,"In his ruling, Judge Andrew Hanen ordered President Joe Biden’s administration to stop approving new DACA requests from such immigrants, referred to as “Dreamers,” once again upending the Obama-era policy Biden had just revived in January. "
social justice,"The decision by Hanen, an appointee of former President George W. Bush known for his harsh rulings on immigration matters, does not have any bearing on current DACA recipients, nor does it affect their ability to renew their DACA grants."
social justice,"In his ruling, he deemed DACA an “illegally implemented program” and stated that “the public interest of the nation is always served by the cessation of a program that was created in violation of law and whose existence violates the law.”"
social justice,"Hanen also writes that the presence of DACA recipients “contributes to a more competitive labor market, which makes it more difficult for legal residents of Texas to obtain work.” But economists have long said there’s no evidence of such a problem, and DACA recipients may even provide a boost to the economy, as they are likely be employed in higher-skilled jobs."
social justice,"President Barack Obama created DACA in June 2012, and the program has withstood multiple legal challenges and President Donald Trump’s attempt to kill it in the time since. It is open to undocumented young people who came to the U.S. before they turned 16 and were under age 31 as of June 15, 2012, when the program was created."
social justice,"There are more than 616,000 current DACA recipients. While they will not be affected by the decision, many others in their same situation will ― those who are already eligible but have yet to apply, and those who are aging into the program. "
social justice,"DACA has been life-changing for recipients, who were newly eligible for work permits and deportation reprieve under the program. DACA recipients were able to get better jobs, start their own businesses, buy cars and houses, and more as a result of the policy, according to studies."
social justice,"Immigration activists spoke out against Friday’s decision and said DACA protections must be enshrined in law, not left to the judicial system."
social justice,"“This ruling is wrong and is subject to appeal. But Dreamers’ futures shouldn’t be in the hands of the courts,” Omar Jadwat, director of the American Civil Liberty Union’s Immigrants’ Rights Project, said in a statement. “It is absolutely urgent that Congress acts now through the budget reconciliation process to provide Dreamers and other undocumented members of our communities with reliable status and a pathway to citizenship.”"
social justice,"The president of FWD.us, another immigration group, echoed that sentiment."
social justice,“Today makes absolutely clear: only a permanent legislative solution passed by Congress will eliminate the fear and uncertainty that DACA recipients have been forced to live with for years.” 
social justice,"Recognizing and celebrating the emancipation of slaves is vital, activists say ― but continuing to take down systemic racism needs to come with it. "
social justice,The journey was one of the two most challenging periods of his life. The second was being detained as a Black immigrant in the U.S. 
social justice,"Yacouba, a political activist in Ivory Coast, knew if he didn’t immediately flee his home country, he wouldn’t survive. "
social justice,"After being threatened, attacked and tortured by people sympathetic to those in power, Yacouba fled his country in 2018. He went to Brazil for a few years, then made a perilous trek through Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras and Mexico before finally arriving in the United States. "
social justice,"As the nation celebrates Juneteenth — a day commemorating the emancipation of African Americans who had been enslaved in the United States — as a federal holiday for the first time, Black Americans and immigrants are fighting to dismantle institutional racism, including within the immigration system. Black immigrants are disproportionately detained, receive higher bond costs, and say they face racist treatment within detention centers. "
social justice,"“From an immigration perspective, Black immigrants face disproportionate levels of detention and exclusion,” Diana Konate, policy director at the advocacy group African Communities Together, said Thursday on a press call. “These can be life-threatening, as Black immigrants often get deported back to unsafe and dangerous conditions. While we celebrate the victories, we keep in mind that a lot of work remains.”"
social justice,"Last month, Joe Biden’s administration announced that it would be extending TPS for eligible Haitian immigrants, a win celebrated by immigration advocates. "
social justice,"“The reality is, as we are celebrating, we want to take the time to honor our ancestors who paid the price for us to be here as a Black immigrant, an immigrant descendant of slaves,” said Guerline Jozef, the executive director of a coalition to help Haitian immigrants called the Haitian Bridge Alliance. “I understand and honor those who have come before.”"
social justice,"In 2018, former President Donald Trump referred to Haiti and African nations as “shithole countries” when discussing immigration, according to people in the room. He then attempted to terminate temporary protected status, or TPS, for Haitians, although he was blocked in court. "
social justice,Immigration As A Black Issue
social justice,"Although Black native-born Americans and Black immigrant communities have their differences, both contend with high levels of discrimination and the lingering impacts of slavery and institutionalized racism."
social justice,"But there is more to be done, Jozef said. She called on the administration to provide protections for Black immigrants coming from countries such as Cameroon, the Bahamas and Mauritania."
social justice,"More than 40 million Black Americans reside in the U.S. More than 4.2 million are Black immigrants, most of whom were born in the Caribbean or African nations, and that number is only growing, according to a 2018 Pew Research Study."
social justice,Discriminated Against While Detained
social justice,"“Immigration is a Black issue. Immigration is a racial issue. Immigration is a social justice issue, and as a Black woman, I cannot separate my immigration status away from my Blackness,” Jozef said. “So as we continue to celebrate, with our brothers and sisters on this Juneteenth, we will also continue to push for liberation and freedom for all people.”"
social justice,"Yacouba, who is being referred to with a pseudonym because he fears retaliation, was immediately apprehended by immigration officials when he crossed the southern border in October 2020. He has since been held at the South Texas Detention Complex as he waits for the asylum office to review his case."
social justice,"He hasn’t been able to see his fiancee, who also immigrated to the U.S., or meet his daughter, who was born while he was in detention. "
social justice,"Yacouba, who suffers from asthma and chronic sinusitis, said his requests to see a doctor are frequently dismissed, and that others have been released quickly while he remains detained. "
social justice,An ICE spokesperson told HuffPost that the agency was firmly committed to the health and welfare of all those in its custody but did not elaborate further.
social justice,"Yacouba said he began to have suicidal thoughts while detained. He said he sought help from a psychiatrist through U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but was instead put in solitary confinement without his asthma medications and was not given the ability to speak with his attorney. "
social justice,"“I know it is because I am Black. If I had been white, they would not have done that with me,” Yacouba said. “I felt horrible. I thought that discrimination and racism were over in America. In fact, it is not. It has changed face, but it is still there.”"
social justice,"“I feel completely trapped. All I want is to be with my family and my child,” he said. “Why is it always that Black people must suffer so much?” "
social justice,"On this Juneteenth, Yacoba is wondering whether the U.S. is truly progressing on the issue of racial equity."
social justice,"DEL RIO, Texas (AP) — Marianela Rojas huddles in prayer with her fellow migrants, a tearful respite after trudging across a slow-flowing stretch of the Rio Grande and nearly collapsing onto someone’s backyard lawn, where, seconds before, she stepped on American soil for the first time."
social justice,"It’s a frequent scene across the U.S.-Mexico border at a time of swelling migration. But these aren’t farmers and low-wage workers from Mexico or Central America, who make up the bulk of those crossing. They’re bankers, doctors and engineers from Venezuela, and they’re arriving in record numbers as they flee turmoil in the country with the world’s largest oil reserves and pandemic-induced pain across South America."
social justice,"But when the little work she found cleaning houses dried up, she decided to uproot again — this time without her children."
social justice,"“I won’t say it again,” interrupts a U.S. Border Patrol agent, giving orders in Spanish for Rojas and a dozen others to get into an idling detention van. “Only passports and money in your hands. Everything else — earrings, chains, rings, watches — in your backpacks. Hats and shoelaces too.”"
social justice,"“It’s over, it’s all over,” she said into the phone recently, crying as her toddler grandson appeared shirtless on screen. “Everything was perfect. I didn’t stop moving for one second.”"
social justice,"Last month, 7,484 Venezuelans were encountered by Border Patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border — more than all 14 years for which records exist."
social justice,The surprise increase has drawn comparisons to the midcentury influx of Cubans fleeing Fidel Castro’s communist rule. It’s also a harbinger of a new type of migration that has caught the Biden administration off guard: pandemic refugees.
social justice,"Two days after Rojas crossed, she left detention and rushed to catch a bus out of the Texas town of Del Rio. Between phone calls to loved ones who didn’t know where she was, the 54-year-old recounted fleeing hardship in Venezuela a few years ago, leaving a paid-off home and once-solid career as an elementary school teacher for a fresh start in Ecuador."
social justice,"While some are government opponents fearing harassment and jailing, the vast majority are escaping long-running economic devastation marked by blackouts and shortages of food and medicine."
social justice,"U.S. government data shows that 42% of all families encountered along the border in May hailed from places other than Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras — the traditional drivers of migratory trends. That compares with just 8% during the last sharp increase in migration in 2019. The Border Patrol recorded more than 180,000 encounters in May, a two-decade high that includes migrants’ repeated attempts to cross."
social justice,"Many of the nearly 17,306 Venezuelans who have crossed the southern border illegally since January had been living for years in other South American countries, part of an exodus of nearly 6 million Venezuelans since President Nicolás Maduro took power in 2013."
social justice,"With the pandemic still raging in many parts of South America, they have had to relocate again. Increasingly, they’re being joined at the U.S. border by people from the countries they initially fled to — even larger numbers of Ecuadorians and Brazilians have arrived this year — as well as far-flung nations hit hard by the virus, like India and Uzbekistan."
social justice,"Compared with other migrants, Venezuelans garner certain privileges — a reflection of their firmer financial standing, higher education levels and U.S. policies that have failed to remove Maduro but nonetheless made deportation all but impossible."
social justice,"The vast majority enter the U.S. near Del Rio, a town of 35,000 people, and they don’t try to evade detention but rather turn themselves in to Border Patrol agents to seek asylum."
social justice,"But as anti-government unrest and the pandemic tanked Chile’s economy, sales plunged and her company shuttered."
social justice,"Briceno sold what she could — a refrigerator, a telephone, her bed — to raise the $4,000 needed for her journey to the U.S. She filled a backpack and set out with a heart lock amulet she got from a friend to ward off evil spirits."
social justice,"Like many of the dozens of Venezuelans The Associated Press spoke to this month in Del Rio, 27-year-old Lis Briceno had already migrated once before. After graduating with a degree in petroleum engineering, she couldn’t get hired in the oil fields near her hometown of Maracaibo without declaring her loyalty to Venezuela’s socialist leadership. So she moved to Chile a few years ago, finding work with a technology company."
social justice,"“I always thought I’d come here on vacation, to visit the places you see in the movies,” Briceno said. “But doing this? Never.”"
social justice,"While Central Americans and others can spend months trekking through the jungle, stowing away on freight trains and sleeping in makeshift camps run by cartels on their way north, most Venezuelans reach the U.S. in as little as four days."
social justice,"They first fly to Mexico City or Cancun, where foreign visitors are down sharply but nearly 45,000 Venezuelans arrived in the first four months of 2021. Smugglers promoting themselves as “travel agencies” have cropped up on Facebook, claiming to offer hassle-free transport to the U.S. in exchange for about $3,000."
social justice,"The steep price includes a guided sendoff from Ciudad Acuna, where the bulk of Venezuelans cross the Rio Grande. The hardscrabble town a few hundred wet steps from Del Rio is attractive to both smugglers and migrants with deeper pockets because it had been largely spared the violence seen elsewhere on the border."
social justice,"“This is a journey they’re definitely prepared for from a financial standpoint,” said Tiffany Burrow, who runs the Val Verde Border Humanitarian Coalition’s shelter in Del Rio, where migrants can eat, clean up and buy bus tickets to Miami, Houston and other cities with large Venezuelan communities."
social justice,"But the number of smugglers caught with weapons has recently increased in the area, and agents who normally hunt down criminals are tied up processing migrants."
social justice,"“We’re doing things the way they do things here — under the table,” a smuggler said in a voice message a migrant shared with the AP. “You’ll never be alone. Someone will always be with you.”"
social justice,"“If you’re a smuggler in the business of moving a commodity — because that’s how they view money, guns, people, drugs and everything they move, as a product — then you want to move it through the safest area possible charging the highest price,” said Austin L. Skero II, chief of the U.S. Border Patrol’s Del Rio sector."
social justice,"The uptick in migrants crossing is “purely a diversion tactic used by the cartels” to carry out crime, Skero said as a group of Haitians carrying young children emerged from a thicket of tall carrizo cane on the riverbank."
social justice,"While new arrivals don’t qualify, Venezuelans requesting asylum — as almost all do — tend to succeed, partly because the U.S. government corroborates reports of political repression. Only 26% of asylum requests from Venezuelans have been denied this year, compared with an 80% rejection rate for asylum-seekers from poorer, violence-plagued countries in Central America, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse."
social justice,"Once in the U.S., Venezuelans tend to fare better than other groups. In March, Biden granted Temporary Protected Status to an estimated 320,000 Venezuelans. The designation allows people coming from countries ravaged by war or disaster to work legally in the U.S. and gives protection from deportation."
social justice,"“I can write their asylum requests almost by heart,” said Jodi Goodwin, an immigration attorney in Harlingen, Texas, who has represented over 100 Venezuelans. “These are higher-educated people who can advocate for themselves and tell their story in a chronological, clean way that judges are accustomed to thinking.”"
social justice,"Even Venezuelans facing deportation have hope. The Trump administration broke diplomatic relations with Maduro when it recognized Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s rightful leader in 2019. Air travel is suspended, even charter flights, making removal next to impossible."
social justice,"Meanwhile, as the migrants leave Del Rio to reconnect with loved ones in the U.S., they are confident that with sacrifice and hard work, they’ll get an opportunity denied them back home."
social justice,"Briceno said that if she had stayed in Venezuela, she would earn the equivalent of $50 a month — barely enough to scrape by."
social justice,"Vice President Kamala Harris visited the southern U.S. border in El Paso, Texas, on Friday, where she once again emphasized that her main goal as immigration czar is to resolve what’s causing Central American migrants to seek refuge to the U.S. in the first place. "
social justice,"“The truth is,” says Briceno, hustling to catch a bus to Houston where her boyfriend landed a well-paying oil industry job, “it’s better to wash toilets here than being an engineer over there.”"
social justice,"“We are here today to address and to talk about what has brought people to the U.S. border and again to continue to address the root causes that cause people to leave and often flee their home country,” Harris told reporters."
social justice,"Her trip included a tour of an El Paso migrant processing center, a visit to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection facility, and a conversation with five young girls from Central America."
social justice,"This is her first visit to the U.S.-Mexico border since President Joe Biden tapped her to handle the administration’s immigration policies in March. Though she’s visited Guatemala and Mexico on immigration-focused trips since then, Republican critics have been dogging her to visit the border and accused her of being unfit for the role. "
social justice,Harris responded to some of that criticism on Friday.
social justice,"“An important aspect of this visit is leading this visit after the work that we did in Guatemala and Mexico, because as I’ve long said ― I said back in March I was going to come to the border, so this is not a new plan,” she said when a reporter asked why she was making the visit now."
social justice,"Harris’ visit comes as the Biden administration grapples with soaring numbers of migrants from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras — all places where the U.S. has played an integral role in exacerbating inequality and corruption — showing up at the border seeking asylum. More than 180,000 migrants arrived in May, according to Customs and Border Protection, and more than 112,000 were immediately expelled. "
social justice,"“The reality of it is that we have to deal with causes, and we have to deal with the effects,” she continued. “So being in Guatemala, being in Mexico, talking with Mexico as a partner, frankly, on the issue was about addressing the causes. And then coming to the border ... is about looking at the effects of what we have seen happening in Central America.”"
social justice,"“As you all have heard me say many times, I strongly believe that most people don’t want to leave home,” Harris said at a press conference wrapping up her visit, adding that migrants do so because they can’t provide “basic necessities” for their families in their home countries. "
social justice,"“That belief has been reinforced throughout our day today,” she said. “The stories that I heard, the interactions that we had today, reinforced the nature of those lack of economic opportunities ― very often violence, corruption and food insecurity, and basic needs not being met, including the fear of cartels and gangs.”"
social justice,"Fending off unabated criticism from Republicans about her failure to visit the U.S.-Mexico border since being tapped as immigration czar, Vice President Kamala Harris reportedly plans to visit a stretch of the boundary this week. "
social justice,"As more migrants have come to the souther border, the Biden administration has continued a policy instituted under former President Donald Trump that denies asylum on the basis of protecting public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this month, Harris urged migrants not to try to enter the U.S. right now. "
social justice,"The vice president said Friday that much work still needs to be done to “build a fair and functional and humane immigration system,” adding that Biden’s administration “inherited a tough situation,” thanks to Trump’s policy of separating migrant children from their parents."
social justice,"Harris will arrive in El Paso, Texas, on Friday alongside Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, her office confirmed. No other information about the visit was immediately available."
social justice,News of Harris’ visit comes as she faces relentless criticism from Republicans that she’s unfit for the role because she has not visited the border since Biden tapped her in March to handle the rapidly accelerating flow of Central American migrants seeking refuge in the U.S. 
social justice,"“Despite being in the midst of a border crisis this country has not seen in two decades, Vice President Harris has not yet shown adequate interest in observing this crisis first-hand,” Rep. Glenn Grothman (R-Wis.) said in a letter to Biden signed by 56 House lawmakers last week. "
social justice,"But her words were met with frustration from within her own party, too. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said it was “disappointing to see” and noted that the U.S. has played an integral role in destabilizing the countries in question and exacerbating corruption and inequality there, including in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras."
social justice,"Harris has pushed back against that narrative, saying her focus is on addressing the lack of stability in the countries from where migrants are fleeing. She highlighted that approach during a visit to Guatemala earlier this month."
social justice,Conservative outlet Fox News has been keeping a tally of the number of days she’s gone without a border visit.
social justice,"“I want to emphasize that the goal of our work is to help Guatemalans find hope at home,” Harris said at a press conference after meeting with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei. “At the same time, I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border: Do not come, do not come.”"
social justice,"Criticism of Harris comes as the Biden administration grapples with soaring numbers of migrants showing up at the border seeking asylum. More than 180,000 migrants arrived in May, according to Customs and Border Protection, and more than 112,000 were immediately expelled. "
social justice,"Though Ocasio-Cortez and other progressives have argued that it’s legal to seek asylum, the Biden administration has continued to lean on a Trump-era order from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic that lets the U.S. quickly turn away migrants in the name of public health. "
social justice,"Former President Donald Trump is also slated make an appearance at the border soon, as he announced last week he had accepted an invitation from Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to visit the border with him on June 30."
social justice,GUATEMALA CITY (AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris offered an optimistic outlook for improved cooperation with Guatemala on addressing the spike in migration to the U.S. after her meeting with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei on Monday. She also delivered a direct warning to migrants considering making the trek: “Do not come. Do not come.”
social justice,"Her comments, during a press conference after she met privately with Giammattei, underscored the challenge that remains even as Harris engages in substantive talks with the Guatemalan and Mexican presidents during a three-day visit to the region this week, her first foreign trip as vice president."
social justice,"“I want to emphasize that the goal of our work is to help Guatemalans find hope at home,” Harris said. “At the same time, I want to be clear to folks in this region who are thinking about making that dangerous trek to the United States-Mexico border: Do not come, do not come.”"
social justice,Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) criticized the U.S. stance.
social justice,"In conjunction with Harris’ trip, the Biden administration announced that the Justice Department would create an anti-corruption task force and an additional task force to combat human trafficking and drug smuggling in the region. Harris also promised a new program focused on creating education and economic opportunities for girls there, among other new initiatives. And she told Giammattei that her goal in the region was to restore “hope” to residents so they no longer felt the need to flee their homeland for better opportunities in the U.S."
social justice,"“This is disappointing to see,” she wrote on Twitter. “First, seeking asylum at any US border is a 100% legal method of arrival. Second, the US spent decades contributing to regime change and destabilization in Latin America. We can’t help set someone’s house on fire and them blame them for fleeing.”"
social justice,"Part of the challenge remains that, despite the best efforts of U.S. officials, corruption underpins many of the region’s governments. Indeed, Giammattei himself has faced criticism over his handling of the issue."
social justice,"But for all the talk about new ways to cooperate, reining in corruption and improving living conditions in the region have been long-running challenges that previous administrations have been unable to achieve in their efforts to stem the tide of migration to the United States."
social justice,"Last month, two lawyers who are outspoken critics of Giammattei’s administration were arrested on what they say were trumped-up charges aimed at silencing them."
social justice,"On Monday, Giammattei seemed less than eager to address those issues."
social justice,"And the selection of judges for Guatemala’s Constitutional Court, its highest, was mired in influence peddling and allegations of corruption. Giammattei picked his chief of staff to fill one of the five vacancies. When Gloria Porras, a respected force against corruption, was elected to a second term, the congress controlled by Giammattei’s party refused to seat her."
social justice,"Asked by The Associated Press about criticism of his record on corruption, Giammattei initially ignored the question. When pressed by another journalist to answer for the complaints against him, Giammattei seemed to bristle at the allegation that he was at fault, insisting there were “zero” allegations of corruption against him and labeling drug traffickers the biggest corruption issue in his nation."
social justice,"
Still, Harris expressed optimism about their ability to work together, telling reporters that the two had a “very frank and very candid” conversation that included “the importance of anti-corruption and the importance of an independent judiciary.”
Harris said the Justice, Treasury and State departments would work together on anti-corruption investigations and train local law enforcement to conduct their own.
“We are creating this task force to address corruption. We are working on a task force that is about human smuggling. We are doing the work of requiring certain progress be made if we are going to attract U.S. investment, private investment, to this region,” Harris said.

social justice,Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the court that “those aliens are not entitled to a bond hearing.”
social justice,WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that the government can indefinitely detain certain immigrants who say they will face persecution or torture if they are deported to their native countries.
social justice,"Over the dissent of three liberal justices, the court held 6-3 that the immigrants are not entitled to a hearing about whether they should be released while the government evaluates their claims."
social justice,"The case involves people who had been previously deported and, when detained after re-entering the United States illegally, claimed that they would be persecuted or tortured if sent back. One man is a citizen of El Salvador who said he was immediately threatened by a gang after being deported from the U.S."
social justice,"The issue for the court was whether the government could hold the immigrants without having an immigration judge weigh in. The immigrants and the Trump administration, which briefed and argued the case before President Joe Biden’s inauguration in January, pointed to different provisions of immigration law to make their respective cases."
social justice,"The federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia, had ruled in the immigrants’ favor, but other appellate courts had sided with the government. Tuesday’s decision sets a nationwide rule, but one that affects what lawyers for the immigrants called a relatively small subset of noncitizens."
social justice,"In dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer saw it differently. “But why would Congress want to deny a bond hearing to individuals who reasonably fear persecution or torture, and who, as a result, face proceedings that may last for many months or years...? I can find no satisfactory answer to this question,” Breyer wrote."
social justice,"Alito, in his opinion for the court, wrote that the administration’s argument that the relevant provision does not provide for a bond hearing was more persuasive."
social justice,"An immigration officer determined that the immigrants had a “reasonable fear” for their safety if returned to their countries, setting in motion an evaluation process that can take months or years."
social justice,"The wealth of America’s 50 richest family dynasties has soared at 10 times the rate of typical U.S. families over the last four decades, according to a new study that warns of the increasing concentration of riches. "
social justice,"The five wealthiest family dynasties — the Waltons, Kochs, Marses, Cargill-MacMillans and Lauders — saw their wealth soar 2,484% since 1983, noted the study, “Silver Spoon Oligarchs: How America’s 50 Largest Inherited-Wealth Dynasties Accelerate Inequality.” "
social justice,"The report from the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank, found that the collective wealth of the richest 27 families on the Forbes billion-dollar dynasties list and Forbes 400 list grew by 1,007% from 1983 to last year, from $80.2 billion to $903.2 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars. Wealth grew less than one-tenth of that — just 93% — for the typical American family."
social justice,The 50 wealthiest U.S. clans were worth a total of $1.2 trillion at the end of last year. The 65 million families at the bottom economic half of all households shared a combined total of just $2.5 trillion.
social justice,"The study noted that wealth among America’s richest family dynasties ends up vastly rewarding family members who had nothing to do with earning the fortune, defying the defense that riches are an incentive for hard work and innovation. Instead, the riches are plowed into protections for family wealth, providing fewer benefits for society."
social justice,"“In healthy, equitable democratic societies, great fortunes dissipate over a few generations as initial wealth holders have children and grandchildren, pay their fair share of taxes, and make charitable gifts,” the report says."
social justice,"“But our country’s wealth is accumulating in fewer hands, including among people who may be up to seven generations removed from the original source of their family’s wealth. At a certain stage, some of these wealth holders — or their descendants — shift resources to consolidate their wealth, fend off competition, and create monopolies.”"
social justice,"Even the coronavirus pandemic has been a boon for some of the richest families. As ordinary families struggled with job loss, plunging income and increased health costs, the top 10 families on the Forbes dynasty list basked in a median growth in their net worth of 25%. "
social justice,"In the first two months of the pandemic, the total net worth of more than 600 billionaires in the U.S. grew by 15%, or $434 billion, according to a report last year by the Institute for Policy Studies. In 2018, the wealth gap between the rich and everyone else was the widest ever since the census began tracking it a half-century ago."

social justice,"An additional two dozen inmates granted parole died behind bars largely due to chronic health issues unrelated to COVID-19, according to research published Thursday by the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs of the University of Texas at Austin. "
social justice,"At least 18 people died of complications from COVID-19 in Texas prisons during the first 12 months of the pandemic after they had been approved for parole, a heartbreaking study has discovered."
social justice,"“Despite being approved for parole, some [inmates] will never walk out the prison gates because they die while waiting for release,” noted the report, titled “Dead Man Waiting.”"
social justice,"A “substantial period of delay between parole approval and parole release is built into the current design of the Texas parole system,” it added."
social justice,That delay has been particularly deadly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
social justice,"“Some of these people were eligible [for release] months and months and months ago, and they’re still there,” Jorge Renaud, southwest regional director of policy and advocacy for LatinoJustice, told the outlet last year. “They are putting these people at risk unnecessarily.”"

social justice,Prisoner rights advocates pleaded in vain with state officials beginning last year to immediately release those who had been approved for parole as the pandemic raged through prisons across America and killed hundreds in Texas lockups.
social justice,"Even prior to COVID-19, people have died in Texas prisons each year after technically winning their freedom. A total of at least 26 people died in prison in 2019 after having been granted parole, the study noted. In the first 12 months of the pandemic, at least 18 people who had already been granted parole died of the virus before they could leave."
social justice,"Republican Gov. Greg Abbott (R) resisted pleas to release parolees more quickly or allow prisoners to finish sentences in home detention like Donald Trump’s former lawyer Michael Cohen was allowed to do. “Releasing dangerous criminals in the streets is not the solution” to the virus threat in prisons and jails, Abbott said."
social justice,"“While COVID has dramatically exacerbated this problem, the data also tells us that this phenomenon is not unique to the pandemic era,” the report stated."
social justice,"Before the coronavirus outbreak in March 2020, a person granted parole remained in prison an average of three to four months before being released, according to the report."
social justice,"More than one-quarter of them had been granted parole at least six months earlier. Nearly 900 people had been waiting for more than a year to be released, according to the study."

social justice,This latest spite-fueled outburst follows a string of recent and unflattering headlines involving the musician.
social justice,"In May, Kid Rock also showed support for musician Morgan Wallen, who was suspended from his label and removed from country music stations after being caught on tape making a racial slur, by giving Wallen his first gig following the controversy at his bar."
social justice,"Early in the coronavirus pandemic, Kid Rock initially refused to close his Nashville bar, despite a closure mandate by the city’s mayor."
social justice,"So it shouldn’t come as a huge surprise that people were, well, unsurprised when the latest news about Kid Rock hit Twitter early this week."
social justice,Many who identify as LGBTQ — and advocates — responded appropriately to the musician’s hateful outburst on Twitter by snarkily writing him off as a troll.

Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and get “ready to continue serving our great community.”"
social justice,"Local police are investigating dozens of vulgar calls that overwhelmed a Palestinian community center in New Jersey on Tuesday and included Islamophobic and misogynistic rhetoric, as well as death threats and threats of sexual abuse."
social justice,"“Unfortunately, we instead were all met with violent anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab, and Islamophobic rhetoric, all coupled with [vulgar] misogyny and threats of sexual abuse,” the center said in a statement."
social justice,"According to the statement, the center received about 30 calls from 11:50 a.m. until the facility closed at 6 p.m. local time. Staff said the calls at one point came from two male individuals, the main one identifying himself as “Jebediah Morris.” In initial calls that day, the same man stated, “You guys aren’t even a real country,” in reference to Palestine."
social justice,"The caller first claimed to be from “Brunswick” before later saying that he “lives nearby so [I] should come over there and beat the shit out of you.” The caller sometimes used a private number to block his name and location, and other times the caller ID indicated he was phoning from Texas."
social justice,"The caller then repeatedly told the staff not to “blow up any buildings because that’s what you people do,” and threatened to sexually assault and rape staff members to “give [you] a taste of your own medicine.” "
social justice,"The man asked multiple times if the staff were Palestinian, and when asked why that mattered, he said it was “so I know to come blow you up.” He accused PACC of being a terrorist organization. Asked where he had received such information, he referred to the Israeli government and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. "
social justice,"Recordings of the calls were shared with The Record and NorthJersey.com, and the Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) released videos including some of the threats that PACC staff had captured."
social justice,"“Most important for us right now is for people to recognize how layered this incident is,” Abire Sabbagh, PACC community engagement coordinator, said in a statement. “It’s heavily politically charged, and anti-Palestinian, as well as extremely misogynistic.” "
social justice,"Clifton police responded to the scene after staff members reported the first wave of calls and had a patrol car outside the center on Tuesday, with an officer inside for some of the later calls. As of Wednesday morning, the center has decided to remain open with consistent security in place for the rest of the week."
social justice,"“This did not come out of nowhere ― this comes from the country’s blind political, financial, and moral support to Israel. What happens abroad affects what happens to our communities here, and right now we’re most concerned about the beautiful and diverse community we serve ― especially the most vulnerable within, our women and children.”"
social justice,"The New Jersey chapter of CAIR filed a complaint about the threats with the FBI, which would not comment to HuffPost on the specifics of a potential investigation. The FBI told CAIR-NJ on Tuesday that it would look into the calls and that it is in contact with the state’s homeland security office, which is also aware of the bomb threats targeting PACC."
social justice,"The FBI said it would call CAIR-NJ back, but the chapter’s executive director, Selaedin Maksut, said the organization has not heard from the bureau since Tuesday."
social justice,"“PACC staff are rightfully shaken up, but are empowered by the strength and support of the community,” the center said. “Like our people and homes in Palestine, we will not be intimidated, we are not going anywhere, and trust us, we will prevail.”"
social justice,"“Propaganda in support of Israeli apartheid and brutality that demonizes Palestinians provides fertile ground for anti-Palestinian and anti-Muslim hatred here in America,” Maksut said in a statement. “This propaganda, adopted by some New Jersey elected officials, gives a false sense of entitlement to those ― like the racist caller ― who make violent threats against Palestinian community members.”"
social justice,"“Calling out anti-Palestinian hatred and Islamophobia is not controversial,” Maksut continued. “New Jersey elected officials must be loud and clear in their condemnation of this violence.”"
social justice,"Police have launched an investigation into the incident. However, detective Lt. Robert Bracken, commander of the Clifton Police Department’s detective division, did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for an update on the probe. The Passaic County Prosecutor’s Office is also investigating the incident as a bias crime."
social justice,"The Israeli government and Palestinian militant group Hamas fought for 11 days last month, causing widespread destruction in Gaza and killing more than 250 people, most of whom were Palestinians and many of whom were children. While the two groups eventually reached a cease-fire, the effects of the massacre carried over into the U.S., which has seen an uptick of both anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim crimes."
social justice,"Booker, who had an upcoming meeting with PACC staff, tweeted on Wednesday that Islamophobia and anti-Palestinian hate “have no place in our state, our nation ― or anywhere.” New Jersey Gov.

social justice,"“There are simple core values that should bring us together as Americans — one of them is standing together against hate, against racism, the ugly poison that has long haunted and plagued our nation,” Biden said at the White House ahead of the signing, telling legislators in the room that today, “you’ve taken a first step.” "
social justice,"“These violent and vile threats are unacceptable,” Booker said. “We must all speak up and call out hate in all its forms.”"
social justice,"President Joe Biden signed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act into law on Thursday, a response to the sharp rise in anti-Asian violence over the past year during the coronavirus pandemic. "

People reported being targeted with racial slurs, spat on and physically assaulted. Women made up nearly two-thirds of those who reported being attacked."
social justice,"“It did not come from nowhere, none of it is new. In my life, in my lived experience, I have seen how hate can pervade our communities,” said Harris, who is the first Asian American and Black vice president. “The work to address injustice wherever it is remains ahead.”"
social justice,"Former President Donald Trump notoriously perpetuated anti-Asian racism by using racist language to refer to the pandemic, including calling it the “Kung Flu” and “the China virus.”"
social justice,SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Biden administration has quietly tasked six humanitarian groups with recommending which migrants should be allowed into the United States to pursue asylum as it faces mounting pressure to lift public health rules that have barred people from seeking protection.
social justice,"So far, nearly 800 asylum-seekers have been let into the country since May 3, and members of the consortium say there is already more demand than they can meet."
social justice,"The groups have not been publicly identified except for the International Rescue Committee, a global relief organization. The others are London-based Save the Children; two U.S.-based organizations, HIAS and Kids in Need of Defense; and two Mexico-based organizations, Asylum Access and the Institute for Women in Migration, according to two people with direct knowledge who spoke on condition of anonymity because the information was not intended for public release."
social justice,"Asylum Access, which provides services to people seeing asylum in Mexico, characterized its role as minimal."
social justice,"The effort started at the border in El Paso, Texas, and is expanding to Nogales, Arizona."
social justice,"“Asian Americans have the right to be recognized as Americans, not as the other. Not as ‘them,’ but as ‘us,’” Harris said at another event Wednesday on AAPI unity. “As a member of this community, I share in that outrage and grief.”"
social justice,"Some Asian American groups have raised concerns about the new legislation, saying that by zeroing in on hate crimes, the bill does not address the root causes of anti-Asian violence. They are instead calling for longer-term investments in communities’ health and economic well-being. "
social justice,Hirono introduced the new legislation after a white man shot eight people dead — including six women of Asian descent — at massage spas in Georgia in March. 
social justice,The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that it’s in “close coordination with international and non-governmental organizations in Mexico” to identify vulnerable people and that it has the final say on who gets in. The agency described its work with the groups as fluid and said it hasn’t identified them to avoid giving them exposure.
social justice,"The consortium of groups is determining who is most vulnerable out of those waiting in Mexico to get into the U.S., and the criteria they are using has not been made public. It comes as large numbers of migrants are crossing the southern border and the government has been rapidly expelling them from the country under a public health order instituted by former President Donald Trump and kept in place by President Joe Biden during the coronavirus pandemic."
social justice,"Several members of the consortium revealed details about the new system to The Associated Press. The government is aiming to admit up to 250 asylum-seekers a day who are referred by the groups, agreeing to that system only until July 31. By then, the consortium hopes the Biden administration will have lifted the public health rules, though the government has not committed to that."
social justice,"The twin tracks are described by participating organizations as an imperfect transition from so-called Title 42 authority, named for a section of an obscure 1944 public health law that Trump used in March 2020 to effectively end asylum at the Mexican border. With COVID-19 vaccination rates rising, Biden is finding it difficult to justify the expulsions on public health grounds and faces demands to end it from the U.N. refugee agency and members of his own party and administration."
social justice,"The consortium was formed after the U.S. government asked the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees’ office in Mexico for the names of organizations with deep experience and capacity in Mexico, said Sibylla Brodzinsky, a U.N. office spokeswoman."
social justice,A similar but separate system led by the American Civil Liberties Union began in late March and allows 35 families a day into the United States at places along the border. It has no end date.
social justice,"“We’ve had long relationships with them and they’re trusted partners,” she said."
social justice,"In Nogales, Arizona, the International Rescue Committee is working with local organizations and using a program that connects to migrants via social media and smartphones to find those “facing extreme life-threatening situations,” said Raymundo Tamayo, the group’s director in Mexico. It plans to refer up to 600 people a month to U.S. officials."
social justice,"Special consideration is being given to asylum-seekers who have been in Mexico a long time, are in need of acute medical attention or who have disabilities, are members of the LGBTQ community or are non-Spanish speakers, though each case is being weighed on its unique circumstances, Tamayo said."
social justice,Critics of the new selection processes say too much power is vested in a small number of organizations and that the efforts are secretive without a clear explanation of how the groups were chosen. Critics also say there are no assurances that the most vulnerable or deserving migrants will be chosen to seek asylum.
social justice,"Some consortium members are concerned that their offices in Mexico could be mobbed by asylum-seekers, overwhelming their tiny staffs and exposing them to potential threats and physical attacks from extortionists and other criminals."
social justice,The groups say they are merely streamlining the process but that the vulnerable migrants’ cases can come from anywhere.
social justice,"ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt said advocacy groups are in “a very difficult position because they need to essentially rank the desperation” of people, but he insisted it was temporary. The government, he said, “cannot farm out the asylum system.”"
social justice,"The most vulnerable migrants may be too scared or uninformed to bring attention to themselves, said Margaret Cargioli, managing attorney for Immigrant Defenders Law Center, a Los Angeles-based group that got involved with the ACLU-led effort after “more organizations became aware of it.” She called the approach a “Band-Aid” while the health rules remain in place."
social justice,"“It has been murky,” said Jessica Bolter, an analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute who believes the administration is quietly trying to be humane without encouraging more people to come, a balancing act she doubts will succeed."
social justice,"“Setting out clear and accurate information about how and who might get in might lead to fewer migrants making the trip, so there’s not this game of chance that kind of seems to be in place right now,” Bolter said."
social justice,Migration experts not involved in the process have questioned why the government has not been more transparent.
social justice,"U.S. border authorities recorded the highest number of encounters with migrants in more than 20 years in April, though many were repeat crossers who had previously been expelled from the country. The number of children crossing the border alone also is hovering at all-time highs."
social justice,"Against that backdrop, some advocates are seeing the makings of the “humane” asylum system that Biden promised during his campaign. Details have been elusive, with administration officials saying they need time."
social justice,"Susana Coreas, who fled El Salvador, was among those identified as vulnerable and allowed into the United States last month. Coreas spent more than a year in Ciudad Juarez waiting to apply for asylum but was barred by the public health order."
social justice,She and other transgender women refurbished an abandoned hotel to have a safe place to stay after they felt uncomfortable at a number of shelters in the rough Mexican city and got help from the International Rescue Committee.
social justice,But they continued to have problems. One transgender woman had a knife pointed at her. Another had a gun pulled on her.
social justice,"The bill, introduced by Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.), requires the Justice Department to assign a point person to expeditiously review hate crimes and reports of hate crimes in order to come up with better ways for people to report them and raise awareness of the issue."
social justice,"“There was so much anxiety,” Coreas said. “I now feel at peace.”"
social justice,"A bill to address the surge in anti-Asian hate crimes during the coronavirus pandemic passed the House Tuesday afternoon, and will now head to President Joe Biden’s desk, where he is expected to sign it later this week."
social justice,The bill passed the House by a 364-62 vote. It passed in the Senate in late April.
social justice,"“Today, Congress sends a powerful, united message that we stand in solidarity with the AAPI community as we confront an epidemic of racism and intolerance,” Hirono said Tuesday in a tweet."
social justice,The legislation also requires DOJ to work with the Department of Health and Human Services to come up with best practices for mitigating racist language describing the pandemic. Former President Donald Trump and his supporters notoriously fanned the flames of anti-Asian hatred by referring to COVID-19 as the “Kung Flu” and “the China virus.”
social justice,"Biden has already expressed support for the legislation, saying that “far too many Asian Americans have woken up each morning increasingly fearful for their safety and the safety of their loved ones.”"
social justice,"“They have been scapegoated, harassed, and assaulted; some have even been killed,” Biden said in a statement last month. “It has been over a year of living in fear for their lives, as acts of anti-Asian bias and violence have accelerated from coast to coast — an unconscionable burden our fellow Americans have been forced to bear, even as so many Asian Americans serve their communities and our nation tirelessly on the front lines of the pandemic.”"
social justice,"In the Senate, support for the bill was nearly unanimous. The only nay vote came from Sen. Josh Hawley, the pro-Trump Missouri Republican who said the bill was “too broad” and gave the government too much “open-ended authority to define a whole new class of federal hate crime incidents.”"
social justice,Hirono introduced the legislation after a man gunned down eight people at three separate massage spas in northern Georgia in March. The dead included six women of Asian descent. Police swiftly arrested 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long en route to Florida; authorities have said he may have planned to kill more people there.
social justice,"Many attacks have targeted older people of Asian descent, such as the 61-year-old man who was critically injured in New York City last month when he was shoved to the ground and repeatedly kicked. Earlier this month, two Asian women, ages 63 and 84, were stabbed as they waited for a bus in downtown San Francisco."
social justice,"Some law enforcement authorities claimed the Georgia killings were not racially motivated, but that the suspect had had a “bad day” and a possible sex addiction ― a claim that prompted more public outcry. Activists say anti-Asian sentiment has historically been ignored or sidelined in the U.S."
social justice,"“This is a huge victory. The forced return policy was cruel, depraved, and illegal, and we are glad that it has finally been rescinded,” American Civil Liberties Union attorney Judy Rabinovitz said in a statement. "
social justice,"In January, the Biden administration suspended any new enrollments of asylum-seekers into the program and since February has processed over 11,000 people previously enrolled into the U.S., according to Mayorkas’ memo."
social justice,"In a memo Tuesday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas terminated the program, also known as Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), after the Biden administration paused it earlier this year for a review."
social justice,"Over the past year, America’s largest cities have witnessed a 150% rise in hate crimes targeting Asian Americans, according to March research from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University."
social justice,"Since the Trump administration issued the policy in January 2019, about 68,000 asylum-seekers were forced to wait in Mexico for their U.S. court cases, many in dangerous situations where they faced violence, sexual assault, kidnapping and more. "
social justice,"The Biden administration formally ended the Trump-era “Remain in Mexico” program, which had forced tens of thousands of Central American asylum-seekers to wait in Mexico in often dangerous conditions for their claims to be processed. "
social justice,"The violence has sparked anti-racism protests specifically addressing concerns from Asian American and Pacific Islander communities across the country. Activists have also established a campaign, Stop AAPI Hate, to bring attention to the problem."
social justice,"In the DHS memo, Mayorkas wrote that after Biden directed him to review the program in February, he’d considered whether it processed asylum-seekers “ in a safe and orderly manner consistent with the Nation’s highest values.” The DHS secretary noted that some of those forced to remain in Mexico faced a “lack of stable access to housing, income, and safety.” "
social justice,"A 2019 report from Doctors Without Borders condemned the Trump-era policy for leaving people to stay “in violent areas of Mexico and [putting] them in extreme danger.” Of the nearly 400 patients the group treated in the Mexican border city of Nuevo Laredo in the first five months of that year, more than 45% had endured at least one episode of violence as they waited to cross into the U.S., including about 12% who had been kidnapped."
social justice,"“We applaud the Biden Administration’s decision to formally end the abhorrent ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy,” said Reps. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), chair of the House Committee on Homeland Security, and Nanette Diaz Barragán (D-Calif.), chair of the subcommittee on border security, in a statement calling the policy “a stain on our nation’s history.” "
social justice,"A separate report from Human Rights Watch detailed how in Ciudad Juárez, Central American migrants reported facing sexual assault, homelessness, kidnapping and other violence after being sent to the Mexican city under the policy."
social justice,"Rabinovitz, who led the ACLU team that previously sued the Trump administration over the policy, urged the Biden administration to ensure “everyone who has been subjected to this policy can now pursue their asylum cases in the United States, in safety and without additional trauma or delay.”"
social justice,"The attack brought attention to the uptick in violence against Asian Americans seen over the course of the pandemic, which is believed to have originated in Wuhan, China, where a number of doctors tried to sound alarm bells at considerable personal risk in the earliest days of the crisis."
social justice,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A detention facility in Georgia where women claim they were subjected to unwanted medical procedures and a Massachusetts jail that has drawn complaints of inhumane conditions will no longer be used to detain immigrants, the Biden administration said Thursday."
social justice,"Any detainees the U.S. believes should remain in custody will be transferred elsewhere, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in announcing the move, which had been sought by immigrant advocates."
social justice,"The Department of Homeland Security said it would terminate contracts with the local government agency that runs the detention center in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts, and with the private operator of the Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia."
social justice,"“Allow me to state one foundational principle,” Mayorkas said, “We will not tolerate the mistreatment of individuals in civil immigration detention or substandard conditions of detention.”"
social justice,The Massachusetts jail was run under an agreement with the Bristol County Sheriff’s Office. The Georgia facility was run by a private company under contract with ICE.
social justice,It also reflects a broader effort to roll back the anti-immigrant policies that characterized U.S. policy under President Donald Trump.
social justice,Mayorkas said ending the use of the facilities is part of an effort to make “lasting improvements” to a detention system that advocates have long argued detains people for civil immigration offenses for too long and in inappropriately harsh conditions.
social justice,"“Today’s announcements show the Biden administration’s willingness to decisively break from the immigrants’ rights abuses of prior administrations,” said Naureen Shah, senior advocacy and policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union, which recently called for the closure of 39 immigration detention centers around the country."
social justice,"Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a part of DHS, holds about 19,000 noncitizens for removal at about 200 facilities around the country, down about a quarter from a year earlier. About 73 percent of those in custody have no criminal record and many others have only minor offenses, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data-gathering organization at Syracuse University."
social justice,Mayorkas has led an effort to soften some immigration policies but has publicly insisted that noncitizens who pose a threat to the public and have committed serious crimes should be detained pending their removal from the country.
social justice,DHS suggested additional detention facilities could close in a statement that noted that it would “review concerns” about other centers.
social justice,Members of Congress and advocates have called for the closure of the Georgia facility since last year after women held there told of being forced into unnecessary gynecological procedures with dirty equipment and other unsanitary conditions.
social justice,The ACLU has called for an end to the “default incarceration” of immigrants and an end to the agreements with state and local authorities that enable prisoners who are noncitizens to be transferred into ICE custody for deportation upon release.
social justice,"The Massachusetts attorney general’s office issued a scathing report in December, determining that officers violated the rights of detainees and used excessive force during a disturbance there earlier in the year."
social justice,"Immigrants held at the Massachusetts jail, known formally as the C. Carlos Carreiro Immigration Detention Center, have also complained about a lack of COVID-19 precautions as well as overcrowding and excessive use of force."
social justice,"Carol Rose, executive director of the ACLU Massachusetts, said Hodgson “carried out the Trump administration’s anti-immigrant agenda with zeal.”"
social justice,"A spokesman for Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson, who was an honorary chairman of former President Trump’s reelection campaign in Massachusetts, didn’t respond to an email seeking comment Thursday."
social justice,But local immigrant rights groups that have frequently clashed with Hodgson cheered the decision as long overdue.
social justice,"Immigrants held at Irwin also had broader complaints about overall conditions, alleging that authorities at the detention center failed to take adequate measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19."
social justice,"DHS and the Justice Department are investigating the allegations of medical mistreatment, which a doctor involved in their treatment has denied, and Mayorkas said that steps will be taken to preserve evidence."
social justice,"The facility in Ocilla, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) south of Atlanta, has been used to house men and women for ICE as well as inmates for the U.S. Marshals Service and Irwin County. It’s run by the private LaSalle Corrections, a Louisiana company."
social justice,"“Given its extensively documented history of human rights violations, Irwin should have been shut down long ago,” said Azadeh Shahshahani, legal and advocacy director for Project South, an advocacy group that has pressed for ICE and the company that runs the facility to compensate women subjected to unwanted procedures there."
social justice,The company had no immediate comment to Thursday’s announcement.
social justice,Brumback reported from Atlanta. Associated Press writer Philip Marcelo contributed from Boston.
social justice,"“I’ll never be accused of being soft on crime, but I’m more interested in seeking the truth than a conviction,” Durkin said. “I believe in fair play. We should never tolerate, under any circumstance, the use of deception to seek a statement or an admission by any defendant, let alone a juvenile.”"
social justice,"And Iván Espinoza-Madrigal, head of Lawyers for Civil Rights, said the jail, located almost 60 miles (95 kilometers) south of Boston near Cape Cod, is “notorious for its inhumane and unconstitutional treatment of civil immigration detainees.”"
social justice,"Though few Americans realize it, police regularly deceive suspects during questioning to try to secure confessions, from saying DNA placed them at the scene of a crime to claiming eyewitnesses identified them as being the perpetrator. Detectives also can lie about the consequences of confessing, saying, for instance, that admitting responsibility is a quick ticket home."
social justice,"The Oregon bill, sponsored by a former law enforcement officer, passed the House this week and heads next to the Senate."
social justice,"Minors ― who have been found to be two to three times more likely to confess to crimes they didn’t commit ― are especially vulnerable to such pressure tactics, said Laura Nirider, co-director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, who consulted on the bill together with the national Innocence Project and the Illinois Innocence Project."
social justice,"Though it is currently legal for police in all 50 states to lie during interrogations, Oregon and New York are considering similar legislation, said Rebecca Brown, policy director at the national Innocence Project."
social justice,"The original sponsors, state Sen. Robert Peters and state Rep. Justin Slaughter, garnered bipartisan support for the bill that culminated in a near-unanimous vote to pass it in both houses. House Minority Leader Jim Durkin, a Republican and former Chicago prosecutor, joined as a co-sponsor and helped propel the bill’s passage."
social justice,"Springfield, Ill. (AP) — Illinois became the first state Sunday to pass a bill that will ban police from lying to youth during interrogations ― a practice that adds significantly to the risk of false confessions and wrongful convictions. It is expected to be signed into law by the governor in coming weeks."
social justice,"“The history of false confessions in Illinois can never be erased, but this legislation is a critical step to ensuring that history is never repeated,” Foxx said in a press release. “I hope this is a start to rebuilding confidence and trust in a system that has done harm to so many people for far too long.”"
social justice,"Illinois has in recent years uncovered at least 100 wrongful convictions predicated on false confessions, 31 of them involving people under 18 years of age."
social justice,"A bill still pending in New York would apply to adults as well as minors. There, deceptive interrogation techniques have contributed to several infamous juvenile wrongful convictions, including 15-year-old Yusef Salaam of the so-called Central Park Five, now also known as the Exonerated Five. The five Black and Latino teens were coerced into confessing to a rape they didn’t commit in 1989 and served prison time before being exonerated in 2002."
social justice,"When the change, first reported by The Verge, takes effect, politicians will be required to adhere to the company’s guidelines that prohibit harassment, discrimination or harmful posts. Facebook has already instituted policies meant to curb misinformation and false news, including removing posts that make false claims about COVID-19 vaccination efforts."
social justice,"The shift, which Facebook reportedly plans to announce on Friday, comes after the social media giant indefinitely banned former President Donald Trump from posting following his efforts to inflame supporters before the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. The Facebook Oversight Board upheld the suspension last month, but gave the company six months to determine if the response was “proportionate.” (The company does not currently list indefinite suspensions as part of its policies, The Washington Post notes.)"
social justice,"Senate Bill 2122 was supported not only by individuals who themselves falsely confessed to crimes, but also by the state’s Chiefs of Police, the Illinois State’s Attorneys’ Association, and the Office of Cook County State’s Attorney Kim Foxx."
social justice,"Facebook is set to end its policy that largely gives politicians carte blanche to break content rules against hate speech, a dramatic shift after years of largely leaving such posts alone because of their newsworthiness, according to several reports."
social justice,"Facebook had largely refused to moderate politicians’ posts since at least 2016, saying in 2019 that such comments are newsworthy and that the company would, as a “general rule,” leave them up to be “seen and heard.” Also in 2019, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was adamant the company wouldn’t police political speech."
social justice,"Trump has called his ban “a total disgrace” and threatened that the company, and others like Twitter, would “pay a political price.” Twitter took a similar stance with its own ban on Trump, and has also instituted policies that hide offensive or abusive messages behind a warning label, or designating them as misinformation."
social justice,"“The long journey towards greater progress requires confronting ideas that challenge us,” Zuckerberg said during a speech at Georgetown University at the time. “I’m here today because I believe we must continue to stand for free expression.”"
social justice,"The Verge and other outlets reported that Facebook plans to publicly share some details about how it penalizes accounts that break content rules, including letting users know when they do so. It will also share how it uses newsworthiness exemption to leave controversial posts untouched."
social justice,Facebook has been on the defensive since banning Trump. Florida last month became the first state to announce it would fine social media companies that permanently bar political candidates there. 
social justice,"New York City will start requiring proof of vaccination against COVID-19 for all indoor activities including restaurants and gyms, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday."
social justice,"“If you want to participate in our society fully, it’s time to get vaccinated,” de Blasio said during a press conference."
social justice,"The program, which will launch on August 16 and become more strictly enforced starting Sept. 13, is the latest effort to get New Yorkers vaccinated as the dangerous delta variant of the coronavirus continues to spread throughout the U.S. So far, about 66% of adults are fully vaccinated in the city."
social justice,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Biden administration has agreed to let about 250 people a day through border crossings with Mexico to seek refuge in the United States, part of negotiations to settle a lawsuit over pandemic-related powers that deny migrants a right to apply for asylum, an attorney said Monday."
social justice,"“To so many people, this is going to be a life-saving act,” de Blasio said. “It’s going to guarantee a much higher level of vaccination in the city, and that is the key to recovery in this city.”"
social justice,"The government concessions would dramatically reshape exercise of powers known as Title 42, named for a section of an obscure 1944 law that former President Donald Trump used to let the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention effectively end asylum at the border while it sought to prevent the coronavirus from spreading."
social justice,"The policy is the first of its kind in the U.S., and follows the leads of countries including France and Italy, The New York Times reported."
social justice,"The government and the ACLU agreed to “a streamlined process for assessing and addressing exemption requests brought by particular vulnerable families and other individuals,” Gelernt said. Once fully up and running, an estimated 250 particularly vulnerable individuals will be allowed in daily to seek humanitarian protection through a consortium of nongovernmental organizations. They must test for COVID-19 before entering the country."
social justice,Biden has exempted unaccompanied children from Title 42 but kept it for single adults and many families. He has come under criticism from progressives for keeping asylum off-limits to many and for encouraging some parents to send children across the border alone. Enforcement-minded critics say exempting children traveling alone led to record numbers crossing and that lifting restrictions more will invite many more people to come.
social justice,"The government also said it would stop flying migrant families from Texas’ Rio Grande Valley to El Paso, Texas, and San Diego to then be expelled to Mexico under pandemic powers, said Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which has sued in federal court in Washington, D.C. The government has reserved rights to resume flights “if it deems the circumstances warrant.”"
social justice,"About 2,000 people have already been allowed to enter the country, exempted from the pandemic-related powers to pursue asylum or other forms of protection while in the United States, Gelernt said."
social justice,"“While these concessions will hopefully save lives, they are not a substitute for eliminating Title 42 and restoring asylum processing fully,” Gelernt said."
social justice,"Immigration advocates have ratcheted up pressure to lift pandemic-related powers entirely, arguing that they cannot be defended solely on grounds of protecting public health. Migrants are typically expelled to Mexico within two hours of getting picked up by Border Patrol agents."
social justice,The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.
social justice,"Administration officials, while insisting that the powers are in place for public health reasons, have repeatedly said they need more time to develop the “humane” asylum system that Biden promised during his campaign."
social justice,"The Border Patrol’s more than 173,000 encounters with migrants on the Mexican border in April were the highest level since April 2000, though the numbers aren’t directly comparable because more than six of 10 were expelled under pandemic-related powers. Being expelled carries no legal consequences, so many people try to cross multiple times."
social justice,"The Biden administration has been running daily flights for up to 135 people from Brownsville, Texas, to El Paso and San Diego since Mexican authorities in Tamaulipas state sharply limited the number of Central American families it would take back, citing a law in Mexico that took effect in January against detaining migrant children. Families are expelled from El Paso and San Diego, border cities where Mexican authorities have been more amenable to taking them back than in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal crossings."
social justice,"Authorities encountered 17,171 children traveling alone in April, down from an all-time high of 18,960 in March."
social justice,"There were about 50,000 people encountered in families in April. About one of every three in families was expelled to Mexico. The rest were allowed to remain in the United States to seek asylum."
social justice,"In a Thursday press call, immigrant rights groups Alianza Americas and Presente.org urged President Joe Biden to grant a new temporary protected status designation to four Central American countries — Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras — which would allow immigrants from those nations to live and work legally in the U.S. on a temporary basis."
social justice,"Immigrants and their advocates are calling on the Biden administration to grant protections from deportation to Central Americans who have fled their countries due to poverty, violence and catastrophic hurricanes."
social justice,"Over the past year, Central Americans have not only had to face the hardship of the COVID-19 crisis, but the region was also severely damaged by deadly hurricanes Eta and Iota last fall, on top of existing long-term crises that include high rates of poverty and violence."
social justice,"Some immigrants from the latter three countries already have existing TPS status, generally given to refugees of war or disaster, until it is safe to return to their countries. But as of now, it only lasts until October. Guatemalans have no such protection. The immigrant groups are calling for a new designation — rather than an extension or renewal of the existing ones — to allow new applicants from the three countries to seek protection, as well as Guatemalans."
social justice,"Currently about 195,000 people from El Salvador have temporary protected status in the U.S., as well as some 57,000 people from Honduras and 2,500 from Nicaragua."
social justice,"“I’m asking President Biden to provide TPS status so we can work with dignity without fear of being deported,” Ana Ortiz, an undocumented domestic worker from El Salvador, said in Spanish. The mother of two fled El Salvador due to intimate partner violence and poverty."
social justice,"Without a new designation, thousands of immigrants from those countries and Guatemala could face deportation to the nations they fled due to economic hardship, violence or climate change."
social justice,The White House and Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
social justice,"On the press call Thursday, immigration advocates celebrated the action, and called for Biden to do the same for Central Americans."
social justice,"Last month, the Biden administration granted temporary protected status to tens of thousands of Haitians in the U.S., who can now live and work here legally for at least another year and half."
social justice,"The destruction of climate change added to existing issues in the region, such as El Salvador facing a serious gang violence problem, with one of the highest homicide rates in the world."
social justice,"Last November, devastating back-to-back hurricanes, Eta and Iota, slammed Central America, leading to dozens dying in mudslides in Guatemala, tens of thousands of homes being destroyed across the region, and half a million people being displaced from their homes."
social justice,"On the press call, 29-year-old Alexandra Yulieth Mejia, a single mother of two from Honduras, described fleeing Honduras due to poverty after the devastation of hurricane Eta. One of her daughters was experiencing stomach pain that doctors in her country couldn’t treat. After a dangerous journey on a migrant train route called “La Bestia” and then walking through the desert with little food or water — “I thought I was going to die,” she said in Spanish — she finally got to New York, where doctors gave her daughter a liver transplant. They told Mejia that if her daughter hadn’t received it, she might have had only one year to live."
social justice,"“It’s a question of life or death,” Mejia said of receiving status to stay here. TPS would allow her to work legally, send money to her grandmother who raised her and has health issues in Honduras, and study to become a nurse."
social justice,Advocates pointed out that temporary protected status is just that — temporary — and requires regular renewals for immigrants to stay protected from deportation. They are calling on Congress to provide a path for all undocumented immigrants in the U.S. to obtain permanent residency.
social justice,"“Today, I am revising the United States’ annual refugee admissions cap to 62,500 for this fiscal year,” President Joe Biden said in a statement. “This erases the historically low number set by the previous administration of 15,000, which did not reflect America’s values as a nation that welcomes and supports refugees. The new admissions cap will also reinforce efforts that are already underway to expand the United States’ capacity to admit refugees, so that we can reach the goal of 125,000 refugee admissions that I intend to set for the coming fiscal year.”"
social justice,"The Biden administration is set to formally raise its cap on refugee admissions to 62,500 for the fiscal year, the White House announced on Monday after facing blowback last month for initially announcing it would keep limits set by former President Donald Trump. "
social justice,"The administration also added that, though it was not likely to reach 62,500 admissions this year ― which ends Sept. 30 — it aimed “to use every tool available to help these fully-vetted refugees fleeing horrific conditions in their home countries. This will reassert American leadership and American values when it comes to refugee admissions.”"
social justice,"While running for president and after he was sworn in, Biden repeatedly promised to raise the refugee cap, which Trump decimated. But nearly a month after announcing its plans, the administration delayed signing the formal refugee cap. Without his signature, hundreds of refugee flights were canceled, refugees from several Muslim majority countries were excluded and refugee agencies across the globe were left in the dark. "
social justice,"Last month, the administration initially said it would keep Trump’s record-low refugee target at just 15,000 for the remainder of this fiscal year despite pledging to increase that number on the campaign trail. Immigration advocates and top Democrats slammed that decision as “incoherent” and “cruel.” Mere hours later, the White House walked back that initial number, and said it would announce the new cap in the upcoming weeks."
social justice,"“The challenge of ramping up admissions to this level is daunting, but America has risen to the occasion before, and given the global need, we must do it again,” Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, president and CEO of Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said in a statement. Not only is there federal support for this lifesaving work, there is also strong community support across the country and across the political spectrum.” "
social justice,"“Generations of Americans have opened their doors and their hearts to refugees, and their presence has made rural towns and urban centers safer, more vibrant, and economically stronger communities,” she added."
social justice,"According to the presidential determination, 22,000 slots for the 2021 fiscal year will be allocated to refugees from Africa, 6,000 slots for East Asia, 13,000 slots for Near East and South Asia, 4,000 slots for Europe and Central Asia, and an additional 5,000 slots for Latin America and the Caribbean. An additional 12,500 slots are available in a reserve to be used as needed."
social justice,"For months, refugee agencies called on Biden for answers to no avail. People close to the White House speculated that the administration delayed signing the directive due to concerns of political optics as the administration struggled to care for the surge of migrants and unaccompanied children at the border."
social justice,The White House also initially said that federal agencies were overwhelmed by the border surges ― a reasoning that was sharply criticized by refugee resettlement organizations and activists. Migrants at the border seeking asylum are processed separately from refugees fleeing war and persecution overseas.
social justice,"“We are relieved that the Biden administration has, after a long and unnecessary delay, kept its promise to raise the refugee admissions cap for this year to 62,500,” said Lauren Hartnett, humanitarian media lead at Oxfam America, in a statement. “This announcement means the United States can finally begin to rebuild the life-saving refugee resettlement program and welcome the tens of thousands of people who have been left stranded by four years of the Trump administration’s xenophobic policies and three months of the Biden administration’s inaction.”"
social justice,"President Joe Biden met with six recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program at the White House, where the young people expressed the urgent need for permanent protections for all undocumented immigrants. "
social justice,DACA recipient Maria Praeli said in a statement after the meeting that she was “enormously grateful” that Biden listened to their stories of how their families have “struggled with the broken immigration system.”
social justice,"They detailed how “painful” it is to have one’s immigration status “in limbo,” Praeli said, adding that the meeting with Biden “made even clearer the incredibly high stakes of permanently protecting immigrants from deportation.” "
social justice,"“We were able to be candid with the president,” Praeli said of herself and the other DACA recipients, often referred to as “Dreamers,” who were brought to the U.S. as children. "
social justice,Biden has been pushing several immigration bills in Congress: one to provide permanent resident status to Dreamers and others to provide a path to citizenship for farmworkers and other undocumented immigrants.
social justice,"The Biden administration is holding tens of thousands of asylum-seeking children in an opaque network of some 200 facilities that The Associated Press has learned spans two dozen states and includes five shelters with more than 1,000 children packed inside."
social justice,The White House said that the president “reiterated his support for Dreamers” and other “essential” immigrant workers and discussed the need for broader immigration reform. 
social justice,"However, immigration reform efforts passed by the Democratic-led House face tough odds in the closely divided Senate. "
social justice,"Confidential data obtained by the AP shows the number of migrant children in government custody more than doubled in the past two months, and this week the federal government was housing around 21,000 kids, from toddlers to teens. A facility at Fort Bliss, a U.S. Army post in El Paso, Texas, had more than 4,500 children as of Monday. Attorneys, advocates and mental health experts say that while some shelters are safe and provide adequate care, others are endangering children’s health and safety."
social justice,DACA recipients have long been pushing for permanent protections not just for themselves and others brought to the U.S. as children but for all 11 million or so undocumented immigrants living in the country.
social justice,"“It’s extremely painful to feel so American yet know that my future in this country is not secure,” Praeli, who is a government manager at the immigrant rights group Fwd.us, told MSNBC before the meeting. "
social justice,"After former President Donald Trump tried to end the Barack Obama-era DACA program, Dreamers were left unsure of their protections from deportation until the Supreme Court ruled that the program was wrongly ended, reinstating it."
social justice,"“It’s almost like ‘Groundhog Day,’” said Southern Poverty Law Center attorney Luz Lopez, referring to the 1993 film in which events appear to be continually repeating. “Here we are back to a point almost where we started, where the government is using taxpayer money to build large holding facilities ... for children instead of using that money to find ways to more quickly reunite children with their sponsors.”"
social justice,"A U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesman, Mark Weber, said the department’s staff and contractors are working hard to keep children in their custody safe and healthy."
social justice,"A few of the current practices are the same as those that President Joe Biden and others criticized under the Trump administration, including not vetting some caregivers with full FBI fingerprint background checks. At the same time, court records show the Biden administration is working to settle several multimillion-dollar lawsuits that claim migrant children were abused in shelters under President Donald Trump."
social justice,"Part of the government’s plan to manage thousands of children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border involves about a dozen unlicensed emergency facilities inside military installations, stadiums and convention centers that skirt state regulations and don’t require traditional legal oversight."
social justice,"Inside the facilities, called Emergency Intake Sites, children aren’t guaranteed access to education, recreational opportunities or legal counsel."
social justice,"In a recent news release, the administration touted its “restoration of a child centered focus for unaccompanied children,” and it has been sharing daily totals of the number of children in government custody as well as a few photos of the facilities. This reflects a higher level of transparency than the Trump administration. In addition, the amount of time children spend, on average, inside the system has dropped from four months last fall to less than a month this spring, according to the Department of Health and Human Services."
social justice,"Nonetheless, the agency has received reports of abuse that resulted in a handful of contract staffers being dismissed from working at the emergency sites this year, according to an official who wasn’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity."
social justice,"José, a father who fled El Salvador after his village was targeted in a massacre, requested asylum in the U.S. four years ago. He had hoped to welcome his wife and 8-year-old daughter to Southern California this year, but the pair were turned around at the border in March and expelled to Mexico. The little girl crossed again by herself and was placed in the government shelter in Brownsville, Texas, on April 6. José called a government hotline set up for parents seeking their migrant children repeatedly but said no one would tell him where she was."
social justice,"Attorneys say sometimes, even parents can’t figure out where their children are."
social justice,"“I was so upset because I kept calling and calling and no one would tell me any information about where she was,” said José, who asked to be identified only by his first name out of fear of endangering his immigration case. “Finally they told me I had to pay $1,300 to cover her airplane ticket and if I didn’t pay, I would have to wait a month more, and I was so anxious.”"
social justice,"For nearly three weeks, his daughter was held inside the Brownsville facility before finally being released to him in late April after an advocacy organization intervened to get the government to foot the bill for her airfare, as is required by the agency."
social justice,"HHS declined to say whether there are any legally enforceable standards for caring for children housed at the emergency sites or how they are being monitored. The Biden administration has allowed very limited access to news media once children are brought into facilities, citing the coronavirus pandemic and privacy restrictions."
social justice,"“HHS has worked as swiftly as possible to increase bed capacity and to ensure potential sponsors can provide a safe home while the child goes through their immigration proceedings,” HHS spokesman Weber said in a statement. “As soon as wrap around services — on-site primary care, including childhood immunizations and physicals, case management, phone calls to family members, education, recreation etc — become available as a result of additional infrastructure and staff, they are provided as part of the operation.”"
social justice,"“The system has been very dysfunctional, and it’s getting worse,” said Amy Cohen, a child psychiatrist and executive director of the nonprofit Every. Last. One., which works to help immigrant families fleeing violence in Central America. Although there have been large numbers of children arriving in the U.S. for years, Cohen said she’s never seen the situation as bad as it is today."
social justice,"Of particular concern to advocates are mass shelters, with hundreds of beds apiece. These facilities can leave children isolated, less supervised and without basic services. The AP found about half of all migrant children detained in the U.S. are sleeping in shelters with more than 1,000 other children. More than 17,650 are in facilities with 100 or more children. Some shelters and foster programs are small, little more than a house with a handful of kids. A large Houston facility abruptly closed last month after it was revealed that children were being given plastic bags instead of access to restrooms."
social justice,Weber confirmed a number of specific shelter populations from the data the AP obtained.
social justice,"That emergency order still applies to adults, but the Biden administration has begun allowing children traveling without their parents to stay and seek asylum if they enter the country. As a result, some parents are sending their kids across the border by themselves."
social justice,"Cohen described parents receiving calls from people refusing to identify themselves. They are told to be at an airport or bus station in the next two hours to pick up their children, who have been held for more than a month without notice, or they wouldn’t be released. Some parents are told to pay a travel agency thousands of dollars to have their child sent to them, she said."
social justice,"“The children are coming out sick, with COVID, infested with lice, and it will not surprise me to see children dying as a consequence, as we saw during the Trump years,” Cohen said. “The Biden administration is feverishly putting up these pop-up detention facilities, many of which have no experience working with children.”"
social justice,"One reason so many children are now arriving without their parents dates back to a 2020 Trump administration emergency order that essentially closed the U.S.-Mexico border to all migrants, citing public health concerns about spreading COVID-19."
social justice,"Most already have a parent or other adult relative or family friend, known as a sponsor, in the U.S. waiting to receive them. But first they are typically detained by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, or CBP, then turned over to a government shelter."
social justice,"“As much as having children spend days on end at CBP is unacceptable, so, too, is having children spend weeks on end in unlicensed Emergency Intake Sites,” said National Center for Youth Law attorney Neha Desai. “With every passing day, it is increasingly critical that these children are released to sponsors or transferred to licensed facilities.”"
social justice,"Over the course of 2019, the federal government held nearly 70,000 children in a system of contracted shelters, mass detention camps and foster parents. This year those numbers are expected to be even higher."
social justice,"“There are a lot of questions about are there standards and who is ensuring that they are meeting them, and what kind of transparency and accountability will there be,” said Jennifer Podkul, a vice president at Kids in Need of Defense, which represents children in immigration court."
social justice,"Some of the facilities holding children these days are run by contractors already facing lawsuits claiming that children were physically and sexually abused in their shelters under the Trump administration, while others are new companies with little or no experience working with migrant children. Collectively, the emergency facilities can accommodate nearly 18,000 children, according to data the agency provided earlier this month."
social justice,"The Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project is one of several organizations that filed legal claims against the federal government seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages for parents who said their children were harmed while in government custody after being forcibly separated at the border under Trump administration policies. In some lawsuits, families claim children suffered physical and sexual abuse while in government custody, at both foster homes and private shelters."
social justice,"“If those children were able to come in with their parents, they could be released with their parents and not placed in government custody,” said Conchita Cruz, co-executive director at the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project. “This administration should lift the current policy in order for families to seek asylum together.”"
social justice,"Biden’s Justice Department is defending the government against these claims, which were filed in 2019 under the Trump administration. But the federal response has been mixed since the change in leadership. Some cases continue to be argued, while others are in settlement discussions."
social justice,"In a recent filing in one case currently in litigation, federal attorneys agreed with the assertion that these policies indeed inflicted harm."
social justice,The judge in the case granted a joint request to pause the litigation until June 2 “while the parties explore settlement.”
social justice,"“We want to make sure there is adequate oversight and transparency for these new structures and make sure that children can get out,” said Podkul, whose organization has been holding “know your rights” training with children in the emergency sites. “If kids are there for more than 48 hours, kids need to know what to expect.”"
social justice,"“President Biden has ‘condemned the human tragedy that occurred when our immigration laws were used to intentionally separate children from their parents or legal guardians ... including through the use of the “Zero Tolerance Policy” during the Trump administration,’” Justice Department attorneys wrote."
social justice,"As for the 8-year-old girl, her father, José, said she is adjusting to life in Los Angeles, enjoying playing with her older brother and, bit by bit, opening up."
social justice,"“She keeps asking me where her mom is, and I keep telling her not to worry, that she is in Mexico and she is OK,” he said. “Soon I hope she’ll tell me what it was like inside.”"
social justice,AP data journalist Larry Fenn contributed to this report.
social justice,"A number of Republican lawmakers have refused to remove their tweets promoting a discredited news story about Vice President Kamala Harris, even after the reporter who wrote the piece said it was made up."
social justice,"“The Biden administration’s weakness caused a surge of illegal immigration,” tweeted Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.). “Now they’re forcing taxpayers to buy Kamala Harris’s book to give to those illegal immigrants?”"
social justice,"The controversy centers on an article the New York Post published on its front page Saturday, claiming that migrant children at a facility in Long Beach, California, were receiving “welcome kits” containing copies of Harris’ 2019 book “Superheroes Are Everywhere.”"
social justice,"The story was quickly picked up by the right-wing echo chamber, which eagerly claimed that Harris was profiting off of unaccompanied minors at the southern border."
social justice,"“An announcement: Today I handed in my resignation to my editors at the New York Post,” she tweeted on Tuesday. “The Kamala Harris story ― an incorrect story I was ordered to write and which I failed to push back hard enough against ― was my breaking point.”"
social justice,"The story now has an editor’s note reading, “The original version of this article said migrant kids were getting Harris’ book in a welcome kit, but has been updated to note that only one known copy of the book was given to a child.”"
social justice,"The story was a fabrication, as Laura Italiano, the New York Post reporter who wrote the story, admitted in a statement revealing that she had resigned from the paper because of it."
social justice,"It’s not even clear that a single copy of the book was “given to a child.” As The Washington Post noted, one copy of Harris’ book “was photographed by Reuters on a vacant bed at a shelter in Long Beach last week. It was one of many items, including toys and clothing, donated by residents in a citywide drive, Long Beach officials said. No government funds were used to purchase the items, according to a city spokeswoman.”"
social justice,"Republicans have been hammering the Biden administration on immigration and the situation at the border, seeing it as a potential political vulnerability. Harris has been a target ever since Biden put her in charge of addressing the long-term issues in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras that are leading to the migration to the United States."
social justice,"Despite the admission that the original story was false, Republican lawmakers ― as well as the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee ― have largely kept up their tweets promoting the fake controversy."
social justice,Below are the tweets that are still up.
social justice,"But after HuffPost inquired about the tweets, two GOP House members ― Reps. Debbie Lesko (Ariz.) and Ken Buck (Colo.) did delete the tweets."

social justice,SAN DIEGO (AP) — The Biden administration said Monday that four families that were separated at the Mexico border during Donald Trump’s presidency will be reunited in the United States this week in what Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas calls “just the beginning” of a broader effort.
social justice,"Two of the four families include mothers who were separated from their children in late 2017, one Honduran and another Mexican, Mayorkas said, declining to detail their identities. He described them as children who were 3 years old at the time and “teenagers who have had to live without their parent during their most formative years.”"
social justice,"Parents will return to the United States on humanitarian parole while authorities consider other longer-term forms of legal status, said Michelle Brane, executive director of the administration’s Family Reunification Task Force. The children are already in the U.S."
social justice,"Exactly how many families will reunite in the United States and in what order is linked to negotiations with the American Civil Liberties Union to settle a federal lawsuit in San Diego, but Mayorkas said there were more to come."
social justice,"“We continue to work tirelessly to reunite many more children with their parents in the weeks and months ahead,” Mayorkas told reporters. “We have a lot of work still to do, but I am proud of the progress we have made and the reunifications that we have helped to achieve.”"
social justice,"More than 5,500 children were separated from their parents during the Trump administration going back to July 1, 2017, many of them under a “zero-tolerance” policy to criminally prosecute any adult who entered the country illegally, according to court filings. The Biden administration is doing its own count going back to Trump’s inauguration in January 2017 and, according to Brane, believes more than 1,000 families remain separated."
social justice,"While family separation under “zero-tolerance” ended in June 2018 under court order and shortly after Trump reversed course, Biden has repeatedly assailed the practice as an act of cruelty. An executive order on his first day in office pledged to reunite families that were still separated “to the greatest extent possible.”"
social justice,"The ACLU is happy for the four families but their reunifications are “just the tip of the iceberg,” said attorney Lee Gelernt. Among the more than 5,500 children known to have been separated, more than 1,000 may still be apart from their parents and more than 400 parents have yet to be located, he said."
social justice,"The reunifications begin as the Biden administration confronts the third major increase in unaccompanied children arriving at the border in seven years. It has made major strides moving children from grossly overcrowded Border Patrol facilities to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services shelters, which are more suited to longer-term stays until children are placed with sponsors in the United States, typically parents or close relatives."
social justice,"“We need the Biden administration to provide relief to all of them, including providing them a permanent pathway to citizenship and care,” Gelernt said."
social justice,"The average stay for an unaccompanied child in Border Patrol custody has plummeted to about 20 hours, below the legal limit of 72 hours and down from 133 hours in late March, Mayorkas said. There are 677 unaccompanied children in Border Patrol custody, down from more than 5,700 in late March."
social justice,"When Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich accused the Biden administration of failing to protect the environment in a recent lawsuit, it seemed like an unusual claim from a Republican better known for distorting climate science in legal briefs defending oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp. "
social justice,The Specter Of ‘Ecofascism’
social justice,It is also a sign that a more nefarious ideological view could be making its way into mainstream politics: the idea that the response to ecological collapse and rising seas should be to limit who gets a seat in a finite number of civilizational lifeboats.
social justice,"That is, until you read what Brnovich considers the source of pollution: immigrants."
social justice,"In a lawsuit filed April 12, Brnovich seeks to reinstate President Donald Trump’s immigration policies, on the argument that Biden has failed to carry out mandatory environmental reviews on how more immigration could increase climate-changing pollution. "
social justice,"“Migrants (like everyone else) need housing, infrastructure, hospitals, and schools. They drive cars, purchase goods, and use public parks and other facilities,” the suit reads. “Their actions also directly result in the release of pollutants, carbon dioxide, and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which directly affects air quality.”"
social justice,"Using pro-environment arguments to defend anti-immigration views dates back decades, to a time when the environmental movement harbored a powerful faction of Malthusians who believed the preservation of nature merited harsh, even violent, restrictions on immigration and childbearing. That faction faded to the fringes over the years as the political right moved to championing both climate denial and hardened borders, and environmentalists marginalized any openly racist elements in their camp."
social justice,"Now, Arizona’s lawsuit is one of the highest-profile examples of how the political right will shift on climate change as warming-fueled disasters mount and render denial an untenable position. "
social justice,"That view has already gained traction in Europe, where far-right parties are increasingly adopting that rhetoric as voters’ concern over climate change converges with anger at migrants."
social justice,"Health and Human Services opened 14 emergency intake centers, raising capacity to nearly 20,000 beds from 952 when the Federal Emergency Management Agency was dispatched March 13, Mayorkas said. About 400 asylum officers from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services have been assigned as case managers to speed the release of children to sponsors. As of Thursday, Health and Human Services had 22,557 children in its care."
social justice,"“As it becomes more and more difficult to deny that climate change is real and human caused, the Republican Party is going to need new strategies, especially if they have any hope of attracting a younger generation,” said John Hultgren, a professor of environmental politics at Bennington College in Vermont. “This is a potential strategy. It won’t do anything to help us mitigate or adapt to climate change, but it will give the thin veneer of an appearance that they care about climate change.” "
social justice,"After green parties picked up votes in the 2019 European parliamentary elections, French far-right leader Marine Le Pen pledged to remake Europe as “the world’s first ecological civilization” and railed against “nomadic” people who “do not care about the environment” as “they have no homeland,” harkening to the Nazis’ “blood and soil” slogan that described a belief in a mystical connection between race and a particular territory. Le Pen is now a frontrunner in France’s 2022 presidential election."
social justice,"In Germany, the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party’s Berlin youth wing urged its leaders to abandon climate denialism. The green arm of Italy’s neo-fascist movement CasaPound, meanwhile, sent trees to towns across the country to pay homage to former dictator Benito Mussolini. "
social justice,"In the English-speaking world, far-right eco-fascist thinking animated the manifestos two mass shooters posted in 2019. The white male gunman who killed nearly two dozen people in a Walmart store in El Paso in August 2019 said he sought to end the “Hispanic invasion of Texas.” "
social justice,"“The environment is getting worse by the year,” the manifesto, posted online, stated. “Most of y’all are just too stubborn to change your lifestyle. So the next logical step is to decrease the number of people in America using resources. If we can get rid of enough people, then our way of life can become more sustainable.” "
social justice,"But Hultgren expressed wariness about labeling the Arizona lawsuit as “ecofascism,” which he said conjures images of a foreign enemy in Nazi Germany. It also obscures what he called the rich history of American “right-wingers instrumentally appropriating nature to advance xenophobic goals.”"
social justice,"The document explicitly cited the 74-page message the gunman who killed 51 worshippers at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, posted in March 2019. That shooter, a 28-year-old white Australian, thrice described himself as an “eco-fascist” motivated to repel waves of migrants fleeing climate change-ravaged regions of the world from Anglophone nations’ shores. "
social justice,"The most vocal proponents of using environmental concerns to oppose immigrants have been the so-called Tanton Network, a collection of more than a dozen anti-immigration groups founded or funded by John Tanton, a rich opthamologist from Michigan. A one-time national leader in the Sierra Club, Tanton, who died in July 2019, “believed that the root cause of environmental destruction is overpopulation by the wrong sorts of people” and that “to protect both nature and the nation, one must preserve white supremacy by keeping immigrants out,” Betsy Hartmann, a researcher who studies ecofascism at Hampshire College, wrote last year in the Columbia Journalism Review. "
social justice,‘These Arguments Have Long Existed’
social justice,"“It is shocking to see what was in the El Paso shooter’s manifesto described in more legalistic language in this suit by the Arizona attorney general,” said Alexandra Stern, a historian at the University of Michigan. “It’s leaning in toward ecofascism.”"
social justice,"“When we call things ‘fascist,’ there’s a sense that it’s outside the American political norm,” he said. “In reality, these arguments have long existed.”"
social justice,"“It’s a Tanton Network strategy,” Hartmann said of the Arizona lawsuit. “This is a blatant first act on the national stage of this legal strategy.” "
social justice,"Axelrod pioneered the strategy with a 2016 lawsuit against the Obama administration’s Department of Homeland Security, which she accused of violating “our nation’s preeminent environmental law, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), by completely failing to perform environmental analysis of its legal immigration and amnesty policies, which have directly led to the entrance and permanent settlement of tens of millions of foreign nationals to the United States.” "
social justice,"“Arizona is the first state to sue, but we can hope that it will not be the last,” wrote Julie Axelrod, the group’s litigation director and a former adviser to the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency. “The environmental consequences of immigration have never been more apparent.”"
social justice,"Indeed, the Center for Immigration Studies, which Tanton founded in 1985, trumpeted the lawsuit as “an important stand for the American environment.” "
social justice,A federal judge dismissed most of the claims in 2018. 
social justice,What The Science Actually Shows 
social justice,"The effects of climate change, meanwhile, are already plaguing Central America, where many migrants to the U.S.’s southern border originate. Two of last year’s named 30 Atlantic hurricanes made landfall over the region, wreaking havoc with devastating floods and winds in what scientists said was a sign of a warmer future. Historic droughts parched hillsides in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, incentivizing rural villagers to make the dangerous trek north to the regional superpower and world’s largest economy. Between 1.4 million and 2.1 million people in Central America and Mexico are likely to be displaced from their homes by 2050 due to the impacts of climate change, according to a 2018 World Bank report."
social justice,"The United States produced nearly 30% of the carbon dioxide emissions currently accumulated in the atmosphere, by far the largest share. Today, the U.S. is the second-largest emitter of planet-heating gas after China and has the fourth-highest per capita emissions rate."
social justice,But research does not support the idea that immigrants increase pollution. 
social justice,"In a 2011 study published in the journal Population Research and Policy Review, scientists analyzed federal pollution data in 183 different metropolitan areas and determined “that immigration does not contribute to local air pollution levels across any of the seven pollution measures examined.” "
social justice,"A 2019 study in the Social Science Journal compared air quality data in counties populated by immigrants and native-born citizens in a series of models and found “that native population is strongly associated with worse air quality, while foreign-born population is associated with better air quality.”"
social justice,A Center for Immigration Studies spokeswoman declined an interview request for Axelrod. 
social justice,"Taking that a step further, a January 2021 study in the journal Population and Environment looked at state-level data from 1997 to 2014 and concluded that “immigration may indeed yield environmental benefits and that environmental quality may represent an important factor or amenity influencing immigration flows.”"
social justice,"“We are saying that by stopping the wall construction, they’re violating NEPA because it’s allowing more and more people to come into this country ― migrants ― and that’s having a devastating impact on our environment,” Brnovich said. “It’s also impacting the increased population, which will have all sorts of impacts down the road.” "
social justice,"In an appearance on “Fox & Friends,” Brnovich, whose office did not make him available for an interview, said he was simply opting to use the same flexibly interpreted law “the left always uses to stop highway projects and airport reconstruction.” "
social justice,"The political opportunism shows how “the outer bounds of NEPA are quite undefined,” said Michael Gerrard, director of Columbia Law School’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law."
social justice,Stern said the future of this kind of rhetoric within the Republican Party could depend on whether the Arizona lawsuit proves successful in federal court. 
social justice,"“Environmentalists have been trying to push it outward for half a century,” Gerrard said. “So it’s not surprising to see the right attempt to push it as well.” "
social justice,"A federal grand jury in Georgia indicted three men Wednesday in connection with the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man who was shot while jogging in Georgia last year."
social justice,"“It’s not clear where this is going,” she said. “But ultimately rhetoric that identifies certain groups of people as pollutants is dehumanizing, and dehumanization is a key component and often the first step toward greater violence toward those groups.” "
social justice,"Travis McMichael, Gregory McMichael and William “Roddie” Bryan each face a hate crime charge and a charge of attempted kidnapping. These are separate from state charges brought against the three men last year over the February 2020 killing."
social justice,"The federal grand jury alleged that Travis McMichael, 35, and his father, Gregory McMichael, 65, “did willfully, by force and threat of force, injure, intimidate, and interfere with Ahmaud Arbery, an African American man, because of Arbery’s race and color” while Arbery was “running on a public street in the Satilla Shores neighborhood of Brunswick, Georgia.”"
social justice,"The indictment charges that the McMichaels “armed themselves with firearms, got into a truck, and chased Arbery through the public streets of the neighborhood while yelling at Arbery, using their truck to cut off his route, and threatening him with firearms.” They “attempted to forcibly hold and detain Arbery against his will” and their actions resulted “in the death of Ahmaud Arbery,” the indictment states."
social justice,"It also alleges that Bryan, 51, aided and abetted the McMichaels and that he “chased Arbery through the public streets of the neighborhood, and used his truck to cut off Arbery’s route.”"
social justice,The indictment came as the Biden administration steps up civil rights enforcement at the Justice Department.
social justice,The federal hate crimes investigation became public last May.

social justice,Dozens of House Democrats are urging President Joe Biden to make good on a campaign promise to lift the cap on refugee admissions into the United States.
social justice,"The White House announced in February that it would raise the limit imposed by former President Donald Trump, but Biden still hasn’t signed the necessary paperwork to make it official. The policy has left hundreds of refugees fleeing war and political turmoil around the world in limbo. Top Democrats on Capitol Hill are unsure about the reason for the delay. "
social justice,"“Having fought for four years against the Trump Administration’s full-scale assault on refugee resettlement in the United States, we were relieved to see you commit to increasing our refugee resettlement numbers so early in your Administration,” Democratic lawmakers wrote in a letter on Friday. “But until the Emergency Presidential Determination is finalized, our refugee policy remains unacceptably draconian and discriminatory.”"
social justice,"The letter was signed by Reps. Ilhan Omar (Minn.), a former refugee from Somalia, Pramila Jayapal (Mich.), Jan Schakowsky (Ill.), and dozens of other House Democrats. "
social justice,"Later Friday morning, White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters: “I expect we’ll have some more news on this today. Stay tuned.”"
social justice,White House officials have repeatedly said that Biden is committed to lifting the cap on admissions. But they have failed to provide an actual explanation for continuing Trump’s refugee policy. 
social justice,"President Joe Biden will announce an increase in refugee admissions next month, the White House said Friday, a reversal from a statement hours earlier that he would leave in place the historically low cap set by President Donald Trump. "
social justice,"The White House faced heavy criticism for leaving Trump’s refugee target ― only 15,000 people to be admitted this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30 ― in place. Democrats, refugee groups and immigration advocates said the decision was misguided and wholly unnecessary. They also speculated it might be political ― meant to stymie criticism from the right that Biden was allowing in too many asylum-seekers at the border even though refugee admissions are separate from border matters. "
social justice,"Biden pledged in February that he would raise the cap to 62,500 refugees for this fiscal year and 125,000 for the next, but he never formally signed the directive — throwing the plans of hundreds of refugees into limbo."
social justice,"Biden is on pace to accept the fewest refugees of any modern president, including Trump, according to a new report. (Halfway through this fiscal year, only 2,050 refugees have resettled in the U.S.) He could change that with the flick of a pen. "
social justice,Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) recently told HuffPost she’s expecting to hear more from Biden’s administration explaining the reason for the delay. 
social justice,"According to CNN, Biden has resisted lifting the cap because of “political optics.” His administration has faced heat from Republicans over its handling of the growing influx of migrants on the U.S.-Mexico border. GOP lawmakers claim Biden’s immigration policies have directly contributed to thousands of people, including many children, attempting to enter the U.S. from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras."
social justice,"But, as CNN notes, the “southern border is separate from the refugee program, which dates back decades and has a thorough vetting process in place for refugees overseas to resettle in the US.” Indeed, many of the refugees who were approved and booked to arrive in the U.S. and who had their flights canceled at the last minute spent years undergoing the vetting process. "
social justice,"His new cap has not yet been determined but is unlikely to be as high as 62,500 for the year. "
social justice,Read House Democrats’ letter to Biden:
social justice,"Biden’s delay in moving on refugees has already caused significant pain. Hundreds of refugees who had been approved to resettle in the U.S. have had to cancel flights. By the beginning of April, the Biden administration had resettled only 2,050 refugees for the fiscal year."
social justice,The White House had previously said that Biden remained committed to the issue but hasn’t given any further explanation for the delay on signing a directive increasing the cap on refugees. 
social justice,"Under Biden’s new allocation, about 7,000 slots are reserved for refugees from Africa, 1,000 from East Asia, 1,500 from Europe and Central Asia, 3,000 from Latin America and the Caribbean, and 1,500 from the Near East and South Asia. There is also a reserve of about 1,000 slots to be used as needed."
social justice,"Psaki said that the administration determined it was unlikely to meet that number “given the decimated refugee admissions program we inherited, and burdens on the Office of Refugee Resettlement.”"
social justice,"Families affected by the delay previously told HuffPost that they spent weeks furnishing their homes and preparing for the arrivals of their loved ones. Thousands of miles away, refugees made their own preparations and sold off many of their belongings and homes in preparation for their flights. Many refugees were worried that their security and health checks needed to board their flights were expiring. "
social justice,"The Biden administration said it was taking steps to speed up and improve resettlement. One is to adjust the allocations set by Trump ― which prioritized Iraqis who worked for the U.S. military and Christians facing religious persecution ― and would provide more slots for refugees from Africa, the Middle East and Central America. But Trump’s ban on refugees from several Muslim-majority countries will remain."
social justice,The ORR is the office of the Department of Health and Human Services that handles refugees and unaccompanied minors who are apprehended at the border. But experts and refugee groups argued that ORR can handle both and that there’s no need to thwart one vulnerable population in favor of another. 
social justice,"“We expect the President to set a final, increased refugee cap for the remainder of this fiscal year by May 15,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in a Friday afternoon statement."
social justice,"“The harm caused by the delay cannot be overstated — thousands of refugees who were ready for travel to the United States last month have seen their medical and security checks start to expire,” Meredith Owen, director of policy and advocacy for the refugee resettlement group Church World Service, said in a statement. She added, “The United States can and should be resettling refugees — and welcoming asylum seekers and unaccompanied children — as it seeks to retake the mantle of moral leadership around the world.”"
social justice,"For months, Democratic lawmakers, resettlement agencies and activists have called on Biden to fulfill his promise. Earlier on Friday, several House Democrats wrote a letter to the president, urging him to officially raise the refugee cap that has trapped families in limbo. "
social justice,"“The asylum process at the southern border and the refugee process are completely separate immigration systems,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said in a statement after the initial announcement. “Conflating the two constitutes caving to the politics of fear.”"
social justice,People close to the White House speculated that the president was concerned about political optics as he dealt with the surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border. Migrants at the border seeking asylum are processed in an entirely separate system than refugees fleeing persecution overseas.
social justice,"BRADENTON, Fla. – Over and over and over, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has described his COVID-19 vaccination plan in just two words: “Seniors First” — yet the addition of two extra words at the beginning might have made it far more accurate: “Rich” and “White.”"
social justice,"Because, while coronavirus vaccines are more broadly available in Florida today just as they are nationally, DeSantis’ earliest efforts, particularly his high-profile visits to the opening of “pop-up” vaccine clinics around the state, favored wealthier, whiter communities — which also happen to be his voting base."
social justice,"Another “pop-up” clinic was set up at a golf course retirement community near Punta Gorda, in southwest Florida’s Charlotte County, that was built by a major donor. Still another was set up for The Villages, the famously Republican retirement community near Ocala."
social justice,"And a clinic was even arranged for 1,200 residents in Key Largo’s Ocean Reef Club, an exclusive enclave of multi-million dollar homes, many with their own docks with quick access to the Atlantic. According to reporting by the Miami Herald, the hospital providing the vaccine doses for that clinic had to cancel hundreds of appointments already made for other people, including those with underlying health problems."
social justice,"“I’m 71 years old, and I haven’t been able to get one,” said Willie Smith, a Black retired truck driver and Air Force veteran, during a visit to Little Buddy’s Neighborhood Store to pick up some lottery tickets. “I’ve been trying to go online, but I haven’t been able to get one. They’re always full.”"
social justice,"Smith’s bad luck was to live in a poor part of Bradenton rather than a dozen miles east in Lakewood Ranch, a brand-new housing development where the median household income is $106,000 — nearly twice that of Manatee County as a whole and quadruple that of Smith’s neighborhood. DeSantis staged a photo opportunity at Lakewood Ranch’s Premier Sports Complex in February, bringing 3,000 doses with him, for the exclusive benefit of residents of the two zip codes that make up the development."
social justice,"Even DeSantis’ efforts in January to partner exclusively with the Publix grocery store chain contributed to the racial and socioeconomic disparity in vaccinations. While the Florida-based company — which is also a major DeSantis donor — has more pharmacies than any other chain in the state, it has also purposefully targeted middle-class to wealthy neighborhoods in Florida over the decades, leaving poorer areas to competitors like Winn-Dixie and Food Lion. Other chains only began offering vaccines in February as part of the federal retail pharmacy program."
social justice,"“It’s actually as bad as it looks,” said Tracy Pratt, chair of the Manatee County Democrats. “We have a lot of vulnerable people who have been shut in, and they were angry that people who had access through a wealthy developer got theirs first.” "
social justice,"Actual statistics say otherwise. According to an exhaustive analysis of vaccine and demographic data by the USA Today Network of Florida newspapers, Floridians 65 and older in the richest third of the counties had been vaccinated at a rate 4 percentage points higher than the rest of the state. What’s more, the better access for the rich has resulted in just 6.4% of the state’s vaccines going to African Americans, although they account for 17% of the state’s population."
social justice,"DeSantis has scoffed at such critiques, typically with base-pleasing attacks on the news media. The governor and his office claim that wealth and race played no role in his vaccine rollout and point out that the first locations to get clinics were retirement communities in Democrat-rich Broward and Palm Beach counties."
social justice,"“It’s the age that matters,” DeSantis said at a news conference last month in Lehigh Acres in southwest Florida. “Black, white, rich, poor, Republicans, Democrats, that doesn’t matter. If you’re 65 and up, we want to get you the shot.”"
social justice,"Nikki Fried, who in 2018 became the first Democrat to win a Cabinet office in the state since 2006, is also thought be considering a run for governor next year and has been calling DeSantis’ vaccine program a pay-to-play scheme. “If this isn’t public corruption, I don’t know what is,” she said at a news conference in Tallahassee last month."
social justice,"“It’s almost like if you’re not a contributor, you don’t exist. It’s like he can’t see you,” said Charlie Crist, Florida’s former Republican governor and current Democratic congressman from St. Petersburg. Crist is considering a second run as a Democrat for his old job, having come within 64,000 votes – one percentage point – of beating then-incumbent Republican Rick Scott in 2014. “It pains me to see what’s happening.”"
social justice,"And as the first-term Republican governor prepares for his 2022 reelection campaign and possibly a 2024 presidential run, the seemingly preferential treatment for his likeliest voters on a life-and-death matter is giving Democrats who hope to stop him a potent talking point."
social justice,A Post-Pandemic Reelection 
social justice,"The aspirations of Crist and Fried and Democrats generally notwithstanding, DeSantis starts out with an enormous advantage. He is the incumbent, and incumbent governors historically have been hard to beat in Florida."
social justice,"Democrats Reubin Askew, Bob Graham and Chiles all won reelection, as did Republicans Jeb Bush and Rick Scott."
social justice,"Over the past half-century, only one sitting governor has lost reelection: Republican Bob Martinez, who in 1990 was defeated by Lawton Chiles, a three-term U.S. senator and Florida legend making his political comeback after two years in retirement."
social justice,Tackling COVID-19 The Trump-Fox News Way
social justice,"He refused to issue a statewide mask mandate and even banned cities and counties last autumn from enforcing mandates they passed on their own. He insisted on reopening schools last fall, months before the arrival of a vaccine, and consistently sided with keeping the economy healthy over limiting the spread of the virus. Restaurants and bars — which experts consider a prime location for the spread of the coronavirus — closed only briefly, and were allowed to fully reopen to pre-pandemic levels in September."
social justice,"A year into the pandemic, DeSantis is continuing to push policies at odds with public health experts. He is suing the Centers for Disease Control to force the resumption of cruise ship sailings — even as he tries to forbid cruise lines and other private businesses from requiring proof of vaccinations from their customers."
social justice,"When they became available in mid-December, DeSantis ignored public health officials’ advice to put front-line workers like police and firefighters in the second group to be inoculated immediately after nursing home residents and medical personnel. Instead, he ordered that the vaccines be made available to anyone 65 and over — even though most people in this category had the ability to remain at home, unlike first responders whose jobs require them to assist potentially coronavirus-positive members of the public."
social justice,"Normal rules, though, may not apply to DeSantis, who won the 2018 GOP nomination almost entirely on the strength of his endorsement by then-President Donald Trump. DeSantis, who is now 42, was a congressman from northeast Florida, little known in the state apart from his regular appearances on Fox News to defend Trump and attack Democrats."
social justice,"DeSantis’ choices affected not only Florida, but, because the state is a tourist destination, the rest of the country. Spring breakers packing into bars and nightclubs a year ago helped spread the virus to the other three corners of the nation."
social justice,"For the first year, DeSantis governed in the traditional Florida Republican mold of Jeb Bush or even Charlie Crist. He promised billions of dollars to restore the Everglades and posthumously pardoned four Black men wrongly convicted of rape in 1949 while pursuing generally pro-business policies. But, by the time of the pandemic, he was back firmly in the Trump camp, loudly and proudly aligning himself with the Fox News viewer base with regular attacks on epidemiologists, public health experts and what he calls the “corporate media.”"
social justice,"His most fraught pandemic-related decisions, though, may wind up being his process for distributing life-saving vaccines for a disease that has already killed 34,000 Floridians."
social justice,"“His approach to the pandemic from a public health standpoint was completely irresponsible,” said David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida. “Voters will never forget that he didn’t take their anxiety seriously. He ridiculed them. And he didn’t need to. It was a misstep.” "
social justice,"He handily defeated the scion of a cattle and citrus family, who was first elected to the Florida House in the 1990s when he was in his early 20s and was finishing his second term as agriculture commissioner in 2018. The Trump endorsement then became somewhat of an albatross during the general election, and DeSantis barely squeaked out a victory over Andrew Gillum, the state’s first African American major-party nominee who also happened to be caught up in an FBI corruption investigation."
social justice,"To DeSantis’ critics, even worse were his office’s decisions, often in consultation with private interests, that put politically connected communities at the head of the line."
social justice,"“We thought that by just having it at King’s Gate, it was basically jumping the line for those people,” he said. “I just thought that particular issue could have been done better.”"
social justice,"In response to HuffPost’s queries, DeSantis’ office sent out a lengthy list of the various clinics and other vaccine distribution arrangements it has used to target poor and medically underserved areas. It would not, however, say why those programs generally came weeks or months after a more robust effort aimed at whiter, wealthier retirement communities. Nor would it provide the criteria his administration used in scheduling the pop-up clinics around the state."
social justice,"“Why did it take so long? We would have hoped that our community would have been treated like other communities,” she said, but added that she is grateful that DeSantis was, in the end, responsive. “We’re hopeful that we can build on that relationship.”"
social justice,"Two longtime Florida Republican officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said DeSantis does not intentionally favor wealthier white people as much as he suffers from a blind spot for Floridians who do not resemble typical Republican voters. One described how DeSantis had just recently helped Belle Glade, an impoverished sugarcane farming town beside Lake Okeechobee, get its own pop-up clinic after its dismal vaccination statistics were pointed out to him."
social justice,"And Tammy Jackson-Moore, the community activist in Belle Glade who helped get the clinic there, said she would have hoped that data showing how hard COVID-19 was hitting Black and brown communities would have prompted DeSantis’ office to act without the need for lobbying."
social justice,"With its recently cleared acres and sapling palms held upright with stakes and “villages” with names like “Harmony” and “Indigo,” Lakewood Ranch could be just about any upscale new housing development in Florida."
social justice,"Harvey Goldstein, an 81-year-old retired constitutional law professor and a DeSantis supporter, lives in a housing tract immediately adjacent to King’s Gate in Charlotte County. He said he got himself on the list for the county’s vaccine slots and was waiting for his name to come up when he found out that his neighbors living in the golf course community developed by a DeSantis donor were getting a visit from DeSantis and a special vaccine clinic."
social justice,"That excuse, though, does not fly with Mac Stipanovich, a longtime Republican consultant who served as Gov. Martinez’s chief of staff in the late 1980s and then ran Jeb Bush’s 1994 campaign. “He was enabled by a combination of confusion and opacity, both of which I assume were intentional,” said Stipanovich, who in recent years has become a vocal critic of Trump and the Republicans who support him. “No one knew what was going on or when or where.”"

social justice,"“We live in the infamous 34211,” said Deb Pierce, a 70-year-old retired college administrator. “It’s interesting to be living in one of those zip codes that keeps getting mentioned on the national news.”"
social justice,"Fine and Pierce said they were not at all comfortable getting a vaccine through the special Lakewood Wood ranch clinic, but in the end did not have to wrestle with that dilemma because they got appointments through the already established Manatee County sign-up system. "
social justice,Text messages obtained under Florida’s expansive public records law show that the county commissioner for that district worked with the CEO of a major developer of Lakewood Ranch and DeSantis’ office to arrange a three-day clinic there and that they seemed fully aware of the political benefits for DeSantis.
social justice,"Bob Fine, a 72-year-old retired real estate lawyer and Pierce’s husband, said that the upper-middle-class white people of Lakewood Ranch were perfectly capable of navigating the system the county had created to schedule vaccine appointments. He said his neighbors would have multiple phones, tablets and laptops running to secure vaccine appointments, and not just in Manatee County. “People would have as much hardware as they could fit on the table,” he said. “People were driving all over the state.”"
social justice,"“We don’t have access to a computer,” said Jeff Warrick, 59, who added that he heard the vaccines had gone to the wealthier part of the county. “They sent ’em all out to Lakewood Ranch, where the money is.”"
social justice,"He added that if extra doses were suddenly to have been had, they should have gone to poorer communities with fewer health care options. “They could have devoted them to parts of the county that were hit the hardest, either underserved by the vaccines, or by COVID itself,” he said."
social justice,"After the developer, Rex Jensen, wrote that DeSantis could get good “exposure” with a visit to Lakewood Ranch, county commissioner Vanessa Baugh wrote back: “Excellent point. After all, ’22 is right around the corner.”"
social justice,"One such area is the West Samoset neighborhood of Bradenton, chock full of thrift stores and mini-marts, but no major grocery store or chain pharmacy. On a recent afternoon, in the shade of some trees in Martin Luther King Jr. Park, brothers Anthony and Jeff Warrick explained that they would love to get the vaccine, but really didn’t know where to start."
social justice,"A few blocks away, Willie Smith did have access to a computer, but as of last week, had still not been able to get an appointment. He had only recently found out he could get a vaccine through one of the drug stores and was unaware of the county’s waitlist for scheduling slots. “They haven’t been doing a good job of broadcasting it,” he said."
social justice,"In late February, though, the former pastureland and upland scrub suddenly became famous for the place where 3,000 well-to-do suburbanites in a politically connected development were suddenly pushed to the head of the coronavirus vaccine line."
social justice,"The retired lawyer from Allentown, Pennsylvania, is 80 and lives in Bushnell, the county seat a half-hour away from The Villages, where DeSantis held a press conference on Jan. 12 to announce the creation of a clinic that residents could ride their golf carts to. Yarema said he wishes the state could have set up a pop-up clinic in Bushnell — which has a median household income about half that of The Villages — at the same time."
social justice,"Pierce and Fine, though, are and have been active Democrats. Whether DeSantis’ rollout of the vaccine will offend non-Democrats a year and a half from now, when the pandemic will likely be a fading memory, is unclear. Indeed, his focus on more affluent senior citizens in the first wave of vaccinations may not be offending Republican-leaning voters even today."
social justice,"Pierce said the episode has left her reluctant to get drawn into conversations about the vaccine with friends and acquaintances. “I kind of was embarrassed and stayed quiet,” she said. “Lots of people were unhappy that this was going on.”"
social justice,"As he loaded supplies from the town’s Winn-Dixie into his car last week, he nevertheless said he cannot blame DeSantis, whom he said he would support if he runs for president, given how many senior citizens live in the retirement community."
social justice,"“I can understand why he wanted to do it at The Villages,” he said, adding that his two month-delay doesn’t really bother him because he just continued doing what he had been doing for the past year of the pandemic. “I didn’t go out that much.”"
social justice,"John Yarema said he spent weeks calling Sumter County’s health department trying to get an appointment without any luck. “We called and called and called,” he said, before finally getting slots for himself and his wife in mid-March."

social justice,"A busy section of Donald Trump’s southern border wall — which cost an astonishing $27 million a mile to build — is being foiled by inexpensive ladders, Texas Monthly reported this week."
social justice,"The typical wall-thwarting strategy along a stretch of the border in the Rio Grande Valley between Granjeno and Hidalgo, Texas, is wooden and about a dozen feet high with only six or so rungs."
social justice,"Some are higher and have more rungs, while ladders up river may be rope-and-PVC or rusted rebar ladders that hook to the top of the barrier. “Camouflage” rebar ladders blend in with the bollards of the barriers and are often left in place for repeated use, the El Paso Times reported last year. The materials for those ladders also cost about $5."
social justice,"In yet another breach of the wall, some migrants are using an inexpensive power tool to saw out sections along the bottom to crawl through before replacing it﻿."
social justice,"Nicol has photos of several dozen versions of ladders. They “show how absurd the idea is that a wall is going to stop anybody,” he said. "
social justice,"While agents admit the wall isn’t a total deterrent, it does stop many, and clearly would make travel by families and especially children more difficult. Recent terrifying videos show children being dropped from atop the barriers into U.S. territory."
social justice,"The artist has walked the border for years, searching out the ladders and anything else travelers leave behind. He spotted six discarded ladders during part of just one day with a reporter, and has spotted far more than usual in the last couple of months as the numbers of people secretly crossing the border soar. Border Patrol caught more than 171,000 migrants along the southern border in March, the highest one-month total in 15 years. "
social justice,"“We have people turning themselves over, and at the same time, when it’s dark we have people with ladders, but we got nobody to go over because we’re tied up,” Chris Cabrera, a McAllen-based Border Patrol agent and spokesperson for the National Border Patrol Council union, told Texas Monthly."
social justice,"The wall also slows progress, giving agents time to nab people attempting to enter the country, according to agents. Lately, though, they don’t have enough time to both process people at the border and apprehend those scaling the barrier."

social justice,"Human Rights First, Al Otro Lado and Haitian Bridge Alliance documented 492 reports of violent attacks since Biden took office, including rape, kidnapping and assault. In each case, the victim was someone who had been turned away at the border under Title 42, a law invoked by the Trump administration that allows border officials to send people back under the pretense of pandemic safety. Many of those turned away remain in Mexico, even if it is not their home country, either in hopes of getting another chance or because they have run out of resources to go elsewhere."
social justice,"The U.S. Council of Muslim Organizations sent a letter to President Joe Biden calling on him to appoint a special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Muslim hate. The White House did not respond as to whether it would make such a decision, according to USA Today."
social justice,"Asylum-seekers turned away at the United States’ southern border over the last four months have reported nearly 500 cases of attacks or kidnappings in Mexico, according to a new joint report from three human rights and immigration organizations."
social justice,"Those targeted asylum-seekers documented in Tuesday’s report came from over 17 nations including Haiti, Cameroon, Guatemala, Russia, Somalia, Venezuela and Yemen, according to the report, which was based on more than 110 in-person interviews, an electronic survey of more than 1,200 asylum-seekers, data from the Mexican and U.S. governments, and other media and human rights reports."
social justice,"Although Biden promised his administration would not use Title 42 to expel unaccompanied minors and has allowed some asylum-seekers into the U.S. for their court hearings, immigration advocates say continued use of Title 42 is inhumane and ineffective, in large part because asylum-seekers face such dangerous and desperate situations after they are turned away."
social justice,"“What I have before me is our clients being assaulted, being kidnapped, being sex trafficked, being tortured, being raped,” said Nicole Ramos, director of Al Otro Lado’s Border Rights Project, “and what I see before me with Title 42 not being repealed is the Biden administration doing nothing to prevent that.”"

social justice,"Black asylum seekers were disproportionately affected. Despite the administration’s rollback of the 2019 Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as “Remain in Mexico,” which forced individuals to return to Mexico as they awaited court hearings, the report noted that Black refugees from Africa and the Caribbean remained stranded in Mexico. At least 61% of Haitian asylum-seekers who were trapped in Mexico were victims of crime there."
social justice,"“Despite his frequent pledges to reverse President Trump’s cruelty at the border, President Biden is continuing a policy that is wreaking havoc: it endangers children, drives family separations, and illegally returns asylum seekers to danger, including Black and LGBTQ refugees forced to endure bias-motivated violence in Mexico,” the report said."

social justice,The Senate on Thursday passed a bill to address the rise in hate incidents and violence against Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic ― a rare show of bipartisanship on an issue that gained fresh urgency after a series of shootings at Atlanta-area spas last month. 
social justice,"The legislation, introduced by Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.), would expedite a federal review of coronavirus-related hate crimes, expand data collection and public reporting of such incidents, and provide guidance on best practices to mitigate racially discriminatory language in describing the COVID-19 pandemic."
social justice,"It passed 94-1 after Hirono accepted proposed changes from Republican senators, including Susan Collins of Maine and Chuck Grassley of Iowa. "
social justice,"The bill would also provide funding to train law enforcement on investigating hate incidents, create a hate crimes hotline, and establish programs to rehabilitate perpetrators — all proposed in an amendment by Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kansas). "
social justice,"Hirono, the first Asian American woman elected to the Senate, blamed former President Donald Trump for fueling the rise in hate incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders by repeatedly referring to the COVID-19 virus as a “China virus” and the “kung flu.” Hirono said she could relate to other Americans fearing for their safety amid the uptick in hate crimes. "
social justice,"There was initially some uncertainty about Republican support for the bill. Several GOP senators expressed concerns about its definition of hate crimes being “too broad,” saying that it could result in unintended consequences during court sentencing. Others believed the measure mandated too much federal data collection on private citizens."
social justice,"“Before, if I was walking around outside, I would have my earbuds on, listening to books on tape ... I would never do that now,” Hirono told reporters earlier this month."
social justice,"But to filibuster opponents, one bill that passes with bipartisan support doesn’t discount the urgency to eliminate the filibuster given fierce GOP opposition to many other top Democratic priorities such as voting rights, climate change, gun control and immigration."
social justice,"“The fundamental reality remains the same: that unless Democrats eliminate the filibuster, they have no chance of passing some of their top priorities,” said Eli Zupnick, a spokesperson for Fix Our Senate, a group dedicated to ending the Senate filibuster. “It’s great that Sen. McConnell is allowing some bills to get done, but nobody should be under any illusions that this means the Senate is working well.” "
social justice,"Progressives were watching closely to see whether Hirono’s legislation would become the first to fall to the filibuster under the new Democratic-controlled Senate. If Republicans did block it, advocates of eliminating the chamber’s long-standing two-thirds vote requirement on legislation would have gained even more ammo to go nuclear and eliminate the filibuster. That consideration may have also crossed the minds of some GOP senators."
social justice,Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) blew up at Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during a House Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday when her colleague interrupted her as she was discussing law enforcement.
social justice,"The committee was discussing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, legislation that seeks to address the surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans. Demings was criticizing an amendment introduced by Republicans that would prevent the defunding of police departments, even though the legislation does not have any provision to strip funds from law enforcement."
social justice,"Demings, a former police officer, said the amendment was “completely irrelevant.”"
social justice,"At this point, Jordan tried to interject, earning a fierce rebuke from Demings, who shouted, “I have the floor, Mr. Jordan!”"
social justice,"“I served as a law enforcement officer for 27 years,” she said. “It is a tough job, and good police officers deserve your support. You know, it’s interesting to see my colleagues on the other side of the aisle support the police when it is politically convenient to do so. Law enforcement officers risk their lives every day. They deserve better.”"
social justice,"“What, did I strike a nerve?” she added. “Law enforcement officers deserve better than to be utilized as pawns, and you and your colleagues should be ashamed of yourselves.”"
social justice,"Committee chair Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) tried to defuse the situation, but the two lawmakers continued to shout at one another."
social justice,"The exchange came as jurors deliberated over the verdict for white former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. He was later found guilty of the murder of George Floyd, a Black man whose death sparked nationwide protests calling for racial justice and police reform."
social justice,"Jordan, a staunch ally of Donald Trump, persistently pushed the former president’s lie that he won the 2020 election even after it led to the Jan. 6 insurrection on the U.S. Capitol in which his supporters violently assaulted police officers."
social justice,"“Defund the police” became one of the rallying cries of that movement. Its proponents seek to divert funding from police departments and instead boost areas, such as education, health care and social services, that can help prevent crime and intervene in situations better handled without law enforcement."
social justice,Carrie-Anne Moss is speaking out against ageism and sexism in the movie industry. 
social justice,"Moss, 53, said she’d been warned by fellow actors that her opportunities would diminish in her 40s but shrugged off the notion at first, adding, “I don’t believe in just jumping on a thought system that I don’t really align with.”"
social justice,"The Canadian actor, best known for the “Matrix” franchise and Netflix’s “Jessica Jones,” recently joined Justine Bateman for a conversation as part of a series hosted by New York’s 92nd Street Y. According to The Hollywood Reporter, she spoke at length about the “external pressure” she faces as a woman in Hollywood over the age of 40."
social justice,"Sadly, it wasn’t long before she got a rude awakening. "
social justice,"“I would look at these French and European actresses and they just had something about them that felt so confident in their own skin,” added Moss, who will reprise the role of Trinity in a fourth “Matrix” film later this year. “I couldn’t wait to be that. I strive for that. It’s not easy being in this business.” "
social justice,"The actor went on to note that she doesn’t feel men in her industry face the same level of scrutiny, adding, “You don’t feel like you’ve aged much and suddenly you’re seeing yourself onscreen.”"
social justice,"The 92nd Street Y event was presented in conjunction with the release of Bateman’s new book, “Face: One Square Foot of Skin.” In it, the actor ― who got her start as Mallory Keaton in the 1980s sitcom “Family Ties” ― is critical of plastic surgery, which she describes as a “Ponzi scheme.” "
social justice,"“Literally the day after my 40th birthday, I was reading a script that had come to me and I was talking to my manager about it,” Moss recalled. “She was like, ‘Oh, no, no, no, it’s not that role [you’re reading for], it’s the grandmother.’ I may be exaggerating a bit, but it happened overnight. I went from being a girl to the mother to beyond the mother.” "
social justice,"“In essence, a lot of these women are getting plastic surgery because they don’t want any of the things they assume will happen if they have wrinkles on their faces,” she said in an interview with Vanity Fair published last week. “They want to shove those things off. But the truth is those things could still possibly happen. And then you have two problems: You’ll still have the things you were afraid would happen as a result, and you’ve also cut up your face.”"
social justice,"Tucker Carlson on Thursday served up a blatantly racist hot take on immigration at the border, saying Democrats are trying to “replace the current electorate” with “more obedient voters from the Third World.” (Watch the video below.)"
social justice,"“That’s what’s actually happening,” the Fox News host insisted, dismissing suggestions he’s preaching “white replacement theory.” “Everybody wants to make a racial issue out of it,” he said. “This is a voting rights question.” "
social justice,"Carlson, appearing on “Fox News Prime Time,” opined on an intro by anchor Mark Steyn, who attempted to link Delta Air Lines’ condemnation of Georgia’s new voting restrictions to undocumented immigrants flying without photo ID. (Immigrants are permitted on domestic flights without the usual forms of ID if they show a “notice to appear” form from their asylum application, which entails a background check, and pass rigorous additional verification and screening processes, the Transportation Security Administration said previously.)"
social justice,Carlson quickly mounted his anti-immigration soapbox and drew an odd parallel to parents adopting kids and giving them new bikes and twice the allowance as their other children.
social justice,"“I think we’re being replaced by kids that our parents love more,” he said."
social justice,"“I have less political power because they are importing a brand-new electorate,” he fumed. “Why should I sit back and take that?”"
social justice,"In the footage from the trip, Cruz pointed into the bushes near the Rio Grande and spoke of unseen smugglers on the other side."
social justice,Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) complained on Fox News on Monday that he was taunted during a photo op at the U.S.-Mexico border last week. 
social justice,Fast-forward to 7:40:
social justice,"“Just a few minutes ago there were multiple smugglers on the other side who were shining flashlights at us, who were yelling at us, who were taunting us,” he said. “Who were taunting, I think they probably assumed we were Border Patrol, but they routinely taunt the Border Patrol.”"
social justice,But given that Cruz is often taunted elsewhere ― especially on Twitter ― more than a few critics did so again and several refered to a scene in “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” featuring a literal taunter:
social justice,Cruz also complained in footage he posted on his Twitter feed last week about the “taunting.” 
social justice,"Cruz returned the next day once word got out, tried to blame the trip on his daughters, then blamed the media and ultimately attempted to make jokes about it. For that and other reasons, the taunting followed Cruz from the border to Twitter: "
social justice,"Cruz’s latest trip came more than a month after he visited the other side of the border for a very different reason. He abandoned his home state in the middle of a major disaster to take a vacation in Cancun. As Texans struggled with freezing temperatures and sweeping power outages, Cruz and his family hung out at the Ritz-Carlton. "
social justice,"The viral video of the incident shows a man viciously attacking a woman — later identified as 65-year-old Vilma Kari, who is Filipina — and repeatedly kicking her in the face. Police said the assailant had shouted anti-Asian slurs and told her “you don’t belong here.” "
social justice,"In security footage, one of the doormen in the building’s lobby can be seen closing the door to the street after the assailant walks away and Kari is still on the ground. The workers were originally suspended after the video came out. "
social justice,"Two doormen were fired after a man attacked an Asian woman on the sidewalk outside their building in late March and, rather than intervening or going out immediately afterward to help her, they closed the door. "
social justice,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said at the time that it was “absolutely unacceptable” that bystanders did not intervene, adding: “I don’t care who you are, I don’t care what you do, you’ve got to help your fellow New Yorker.”"
social justice,"The union that the doormen were part of, SEIU 32BJ, confirmed the firings to HuffPost and said that both employees had begun the process of filing a grievance challenging their terminations."
social justice,"The Brodsky Organization, which owns the condo building in question on West 43rd Street in Manhattan, fired the workers on Tuesday, saying in a statement to the media that “required emergency and safety protocols were not followed” during the incident."
social justice,The company noted that a full video (rather than the shorter clip that went viral) showed the doormen coming out of the building later to assist the woman and flag down a police car.
social justice,"A suspect, Brandon Elliott, was later arrested and charged with felony assault as a hate crime, according to police. Kari sustained serious injuries, including a fractured pelvis, and has been released from the hospital, NPR reported."
social justice,"The attack sparked outrage as anti-Asian racism rises nationwide. Since last year, Asian Americans have been reporting a surge in racist violence, often related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hate crimes targeting Asian American and Pacific Islanders rose by 150% in major U.S. cities, according to one study. Stop AAPI Hate recorded an alarming 3,795 reports of racist violence against Asian Americans from early 2020 to early 2021. People were called racial slurs, spat on and assaulted. "
social justice,"The former doormen’s union said that it takes “anti-Asian hatred, and all forms of discrimination, seriously” and noted that its members are majority “immigrant, Black and brown workers” who face “much of the same racism and violence that our AAPI neighbors” do. "
social justice,"“All union workers, especially workers of color who are often the subject of unfair treatment on the job, have a right to a fair process,” the union said."
social justice,"House Republican leaders on Wednesday accused Vice President Kamala Harris of being absent on immigration matters ― even showing up to a press conference with a milk carton with Harris’ face on it, declaring her “missing” at the border."
social justice,"“We think it’s important the press continues to ask the White House about the extent to which the president has said Vice President Harris is in charge at the border,” said House Republican Conference Chair Liz Cheney (Wyo.). “Nobody seems to be in charge.”"
social justice,"“She refuses to go down,” Scalise said. “But if she’s the vice president of the United States and the president put her in charge of this, Vice President Harris needs to go down to the border and see this for herself.”"
social justice,"Harris, meanwhile, was at the White House heading into a meeting with experts on what is driving a surge in migrants from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, a region known as the Northern Triangle. She announced an upcoming trip to the area and clarified that her role in Biden’s immigration policies isn’t border-specific."
social justice,"“The president has asked [Homeland Security] Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas to address what is going on at the border,” Harris said, per a White House pool report. “I have been asked to address the root causes, similar to what” Biden did as during his time as vice president to former President Barack Obama."
social justice,"With that milk carton in hand, House GOP Whip Steve Scalise (La.) demanded to know why Harris, who President Joe Biden recently tapped to examine the root causes of migration at the Mexican border, wasn’t personally visiting the region. "
social justice,"One problem: At the same time, Harris was holding a White House meeting on immigration and announcing her plans to visit Mexico and Guatemala."
social justice,"Still evidently unaware that Harris was discussing her travel plans, Scalise speculated she was avoiding the border because of the effects of some of Biden’s executive orders. The president created a task force to reunite families separated at the border by former President Donald Trump’s policies, and began a review of a Trump-era program that has forced tens of thousands of people to remain in Mexico while their asylum cases are processed."
social justice,"“Maybe because she doesn’t want to be associated with this disgraceful policy,” Scalise said of Harris not going to the border."
social justice,"“These open-border policies that were completely created by this president, Joe Biden, must be turned around,” said Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.). “This is a crisis that was created by President Joe Biden ... He broke this, and he needs to own it and he needs to fix it.”"
social justice,"Republicans have falsely claimed that Biden’s executive actions are responsible for the massive levels of unaccompanied children and teenagers coming across the border and filling up increasingly crowded shelters, rather than the years’ worth of broken U.S. immigration policies that Biden inherited three months ago."
social justice,"In reality, the surge in migrant children at the border is not unique to the Biden administration. There were significant spikes under Trump in 2019, and under Obama in 2014. The difference from the Trump administration is that Biden refuses to summarily kick children out of the country, sending them back to potential danger in Mexico or the home countries they fled."
social justice,"Instead, the Biden administration is reverting to the legal system of putting children through immigration proceedings to determine whether they can stay in the U.S. ― a system that takes more time, and means they need to stay with family or sponsors."
social justice,"That’s not stopping Republican leaders from trying to find a way to ding Biden on immigration, though, or to spin Trump’s legacy. Even if it means being dishonest."
social justice,"“You can go back to the Trump policies, ‘Remain in Mexico.’ Everybody will tell you that policy was working,” Scalise said. “The Border Patrol agents tell us.”"
social justice,"More than 172,000 people, mostly single adults, attempted to cross into the U.S. at the southern border in March, 71% more than in February, according to statistics that Customs and Border Protection released Thursday. It the largest single-month total in at least 15 years."
social justice,"That policy did keep people out of the United States ― at the cost of violent, unspeakable suffering."
social justice,"There was also a record number of unaccompanied minors in March: 18,890 children from Central America, double the February total and the largest single-month tally on record. The previous high of 11,475 unaccompanied minors occurred in May 2019."
social justice,"Republicans in Congress have widely rebuffed the president’s immigration plan, largely refusing to support recent bills that passed in the House that would grant relief to immigrants living and working in the U.S. And while Republicans have attempted to blame Biden’s softer stance on immigration for the recent surge at the border, experts said the rise in migrants is more complicated, pointing to contributing factors such as violence in Central American countries, climate change and decades of failed immigration policies. "
social justice,"The migrant crossing record is testing the Biden administration’s ability to mitigate the surge and properly care for families and children at the border. The president and his top officials have refused to call the situation a “crisis,”repeatedly emphasizing that the government has inherited mayhem from the Donald Trump administration and that the current influx is akin to surges past administrations have faced. "
social justice,Officials noted that the 30-day daily average of children transferred out of CBP custody has risen from 276 at the end of February to 507 at the end of March. The administration had previously faced backlash as it struggled to provide adequate housing for the thousands of minors entering the country.
social justice,"“We’re going to utilize all of the options that we have available to us to safely care for the children who are in our custody, and that includes long-term and short-term solutions,” a Biden administration official told reporters in an informational call."
social justice,"According to Thursday’s data, CBP also expelled 103,900 people in March, or 60% of the total, under a Trump-era policy, known as Title 42, that allows border officials to turn away migrants in light of the coronavirus pandemic. Officials said 28% of those were people who had previously tried to enter and been turned away. "
social justice,"Although Biden promised it would not use Title 42 to expel unaccompanied minors, immigration advocates say the policy is inhumane and ineffective, and should not be used to turn away adults either. "
social justice,"Since taking office, Biden has made immigration a White House priority, reversing many of Trump’s hard-line policies. The Biden administration’s changes include offering millions a path to citizenship and revoking the 2019 Migrant Protection Protocols, which forced individuals to return to Mexico as they wait for court hearings."
social justice,"Biden administration officials told reporters that it is working with various government agencies and other partners to alleviate the situation as quickly as possible, including adding thousands of beds in facilities across Texas and elsewhere for unaccompanied children. Officials also said they were adding several emergency intake sites to reduce crowding in CBP facilities and avoid holding children for longer than the 72-hour legal limit."
social justice,"DONNA, Texas (AP) — More than 500 migrant children were packed into plastic-walled rooms built for 32 people, sitting inches apart on mats with foil blankets Tuesday at the largest U.S. Customs and Border Protection holding facility for unaccompanied children."
social justice,"Overall, CBP’s main child processing center, a compound of white tents in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley, held over 4,100 migrants, more than 3,400 of them children who traveled to the U.S.-Mexico border alone and the rest of them families. It is designed for 250 people under guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the coronavirus pandemic."
social justice,The Biden administration allowed journalists to see conditions for the first time since the facility opened Feb. 9 amid a spike in families and unaccompanied children crossing the border.
social justice,"A 3,200-square-foot (297-square-meter) space had been divided into several rooms for 32 children each under CDC guidelines, each separated by thick plastic walls instead of the chain-link fence used by previous administrations. Despite the health recommendations, one of the “pods” held nearly 700 kids, another had nearly 600 and others had just above 500. Everyone wore masks, but COVID-19 tests aren’t done unless they show symptoms."
social justice,It was a grim picture.
social justice,"Doors to the rooms were open for free movement but there was little room to roam and no one to play games. Most children just sat on the ground close together, chatting quietly. Some were wrapped in foil blankets. Lights are dimmed at night."
social justice,"Children, most of them between 13 and 17, are separated by age. Families occupied a separate pod that was less crowded than the jam-packed rooms for older children."
social justice,"A room for “tender age” children from 3 to 9 years old consisted of a walled playpen with mats on the floor and far more space than the eight pods for older children. An 11-year-old boy cared for his 3-year-old sister, and a 17-year-old cared for her newborn."
social justice,"“I’m a Border Patrol agent. I didn’t sign up for this,” Oscar Escamilla, acting executive officer of the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector, said while looking at the younger kids."
social justice,About two dozen of some 270 children being transferred to HHS midday tested positive for COVID-19 — the only time they are tested unless they exhibit symptoms earlier. Escamilla said the overall positivity rate at the Donna facility was about 14%.
social justice,"
As they prepared to leave, children who tested negative for COVID-19 played soccer in the outdoor recreation area, where they can go three times a day when their pods are being cleaned. Those who tested positive for the virus gathered around metal benches off to the side and will still go to HHS centers.
The Border Patrol is apprehending far more children daily than HHS is taking, leading to a severe backlog. The Border Patrol is not supposed to detain children for more than three days, but HHS lacks space.
More than 2,000 kids have been at the Donna facility for more than 72 hours, including 39 for more than 15 days. One child had been there 20 days. The average stay was 133 hours.
“The intent of the Border Patrol is not detention. We’re not in the business of detention,” said Escamilla, the official who supervised the media tour. “We’re forced into the business because we can’t turn them over to anybody.”
HHS is housing children at convention centers in Dallas and San Diego and is opening large-scale sites in San Antonio, El Paso and elsewhere.
A large HHS facility is being built near the holding center in Donna, separated by a chain-link fence. Noise from construction equipment filled the air near seven buses that were to take children to other HHS facilities.
About 250 to 300 children enter the Donna facility daily and far fewer leave, a “lopsided” difference that Escamilla said was leading to more crowded conditions. It has held as many as 4,600 migrants.
More than 17,000 unaccompanied children were in U.S. custody as of Monday, about 12,000 with HHS and the rest with Customs and Border Protection. On Monday, 446 children entered CBP custody but only 229 went to HHS.
HHS, which opened a facility Tuesday for 500 children at Fort Bliss in Texas, is working to build up to a capacity of 13,500 beds, spokesman Mark Weber said.
Several hundred kids and teenagers are crossing the border daily, most fleeing violence, poverty or the effects of natural disasters in Central America. President Joe Biden has declined to resume his predecessor’s practice of expelling unaccompanied children.
But his administration has continued expelling adults under a coronavirus-related public health declaration enacted by former President Donald Trump. Biden also has tried to expel most families traveling together, but changes in Mexican law have forced agents to release many parents and children into the U.S.
In some cases, parents refused entry into the U.S. have sent their children across the border alone, hoping they will be placed with relatives eventually.
Biden has faced intense pressure to bring more transparency to how large numbers of migrant children are being treated. In his administration’s first tour of the Donna holding facility, two journalists from The Associated Press and a crew from CBS shared text, photos and video with other news outlets as part of a pool arrangement.
At the facility, children entered a tent with a dirt floor and three rows of bleacher-style seats. About 60 children waited to be admitted Tuesday, all wearing masks and seated close together.
They then go into a small room for lice and scabies inspection and a general health check, including whether they have a fever. Their hair is hosed down.
The facility is staffed by physician assistants and nurse practitioners, who perform psychological tests, including asking children if they have had any suicidal thoughts. All shoelaces are removed to avoid harm to anyone.
Amid the loud hum of air conditioning vents, children are led to a room for processing, with anyone 14 and older getting photographed and having their fingerprints taken. Younger kids don’t.
In another room, agents ask them if they have a contact in the U.S. and allow the child to speak with them by phone. Plastic shields separate the agents and the children, who are seated at tables. They get bracelets with a barcode that shows a history of when they showered, medical conditions and any other personal information.
All children are given notices to appear in immigration court, clearing the way for them to be released to Health and Human Services. About 1,200 children were ready for release Tuesday but there was nowhere to send them, Escamilla said.

Merchant reported from Houston.
"
social justice,"A bill meant to address the rise of hate crimes and violence against Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic advanced in the U.S. Senate on a bipartisan vote on Wednesday — but its future remains murky, given tepid support from Republicans."
social justice,"The legislation, introduced by Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.), would expedite a federal review of coronavirus-related hate crimes, expand public reporting of such incidents, and provide guidance detailing best practices to “mitigate racially discriminatory language in describing the COVID–19 pandemic.”"
social justice,The vote to begin debate on the measure was 92-6.
social justice,Republicans only backed the initial vote on the condition they would have an opportunity to offer amendments. Their continued support will ultimately depend on whether top Senate leaders can agree on which amendments the chamber will consider in the coming days. 
social justice,"“In consultation with the Republican leader, we can work out an agreement on other germane, non-gotcha amendments to the bill if senators have them,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a floor speech on Wednesday. “We should be able — and should really try in earnest — to reach a final resolution and pass the bill through the Senate very, very soon.”"
social justice,"The children are processed in the tent-like facility in the Texas border town of Donna before being taken to longer-term care facilities run by U.S. Health and Human Services and then placed with a family member, relative or sponsor."
social justice,"One amendment with bipartisan support is being offered by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kansas). Their bill, called the No Hate Act, would train law enforcement on investigating hate crimes, create a hate crimes hotline, and establish programs to rehabilitate perpetrators."
social justice,"The Hawaii senator indicated her willingness to make changes to her bill, but she defended the reason why it was introduced ― namely, the rise of hate crimes against Asian Americans that accelerated under former President Donald Trump. "
social justice,"“Some of them have absolutely nothing to do with the bill,” she said on Wednesday."
social justice,"“It seems to say the hate crime has to be linked to COVID, which is rather odd,” Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Tuesday when asked about the measure. "
social justice,"Other Republicans, meanwhile, have expressed concerns about a provision in Hirono’s bill that would offer guidance to states on how to “mitigate racially discriminatory language.” Controversial amendments, if offered, could ultimately sink the bill. "
social justice,"Abbott, a Republican, announced during a press conference Wednesday that his state had received complaints of sexual abuse at a federal facility that houses migrant youth. Abbott blamed President Joe Biden’s immigration policies and called for the facility to be shut down."
social justice,"Hirono said Republicans have offered 20 amendments so far, though all aren’t likely to receive a vote. "
social justice,Fox News’ Chris Wallace on Sunday questioned Texas Gov. Greg Abbott about why he had attacked the Biden administration over reports of sexual assault at a migrant shelter despite being silent on the matter when President Donald Trump was in office.
social justice,"Unlike the Blumenthal-Moran measure, however, Hirono’s bill includes specific references to COVID-19, a definition some GOP senators would like to broaden."
social justice,"“It really came to the fore during COVID-19 and having a president calling it a ‘China virus,’ so I think it led to an increase in these kinds of attacks. That’s why there’s that framing to remind us, how did this happen?” Hirono said. "
social justice,"But immigrant advocates condemned Abbott’s press conference as political theater, noting that he failed to speak up over widespread reports of sexual abuse at immigrant detention centers during the Trump administration."
social justice,He went on to suggest that he was fully aware of the migrant sexual assault allegations during the Trump administration but didn’t speak out at the time because those complaints were filed with federal agencies.
social justice,"“Governor, there were thousands of complaints of sexual assault at migrant shelters during the Trump years,” Wallace said during his interview with Abbott on “Fox News Sunday.” “Not to say that what’s going on now is right, but we couldn’t find one instance of you complaining and calling that out when President Trump was president.”"
social justice,"“The one that I talked about earlier this past week were reports that were filed with state agencies,” Abbott said. “So we have a duty to respond to any complaint about child sexual abuse as well as to investigate it and that’s exactly what I did to make sure it was addressed.”"
social justice,"The sex abuse Abbott cited Wednesday allegedly took place at the Freeman Coliseum in San Antonio, Texas. More than 1,300 teens who crossed the border into the U.S. from Mexico without a parent or guardian are reportedly being held there."
social justice,"“The only reason why Abbott is now acting like he cares about the children in these facilities is for political reasons,” Jonathan Ryan, CEO of the Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, said in a statement."
social justice,"Abbott said there were “multiple differences” between how the Trump and Biden administrations handled the alleged sexual abuse, including the “constant communication” his office received from Trump officials on the matter."
social justice,"“In short, this facility is a health and safety nightmare,” Abbott told reporters Wednesday. “The Biden administration is now presiding over the abuse of children.”"
social justice,"“Don’t fall prey to Democrats or others saying, ‘Well, Abbott didn’t complain about this in the past,’” he added. “What they need to focus on is exactly what I called attention to last month in Dallas, Texas, where I pointed out then that there were going to be instances of child sex abuse taking place.”"
social justice,"From 2014 to 2018, under the Obama administration and subsequent Trump presidency, the Department of Health and Human Services received more than 4,500 complaints of sexual harassment and abuse against government-run migrant shelters, The Texas Tribune reported."
social justice,"“What the governor wants is for the Biden administration to stop allowing children to seek home and safety in this country,” Ryan added. “That is not the solution to the challenge we have in front of us. We must ensure the children are released as soon as possible and be reunited with their families in the U.S.”"
social justice,Watch Abbott’s full appearance on “Fox News Sunday” below.
social justice,"The backlog of asylum applicants waiting for a decision from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has grown to more than 386,000 as of September 2020, according to a new report from the nonprofit Human Rights First. HuffPost was given an early look at the report, released on Friday. "
social justice,"U.S. law requires officials to conduct the initial asylum interviews within 45 days of the application and make a decision within 180 days, but many asylum-seekers have waited years for an answer, the report finds. Applicants are essentially stuck while they wait ― unable to legally work, pursue educational opportunities, or obtain medical care and housing. They live with the constant threat of possible deportation as they await permanent status."
social justice,"The report finds that the backlog isn’t improving so far under President Joe Biden, as delays continue to leave asylum-seekers in perilous situations indefinitely. Lack of resources for asylum officers, shifting immigration priorities and the anti-immigrant policies former President Donald Trump implemented have all contributed to the record-high number of pending applications. "
social justice,"“The asylum office is supposed to be providing humanitarian protection to refugees and their family members, and those failures put people’s lives at risk,” said Kennji Kizuka, senior researcher and policy analyst for refugee protection at Human Rights First."
social justice,"The Biden administration is considering overhauling the asylum system to speed up the process, amid criticism for its handling of the surge of migrants and asylum-seekers at the U.S. border. And Biden has already undertaken some reforms, including allowing some migrants to enter the country while their cases are being processed. But many asylum-seekers are still trapped at the U.S. border awaiting entry, including some who have waited for years. Others, including a pregnant woman who was reportedly in labor, were deported back to their home countries."
social justice,Decades Of Failed Immigration Policies
social justice,"There are two ways of obtaining asylum in the United States. Under the affirmative process, an individual who is already inside the U.S. files an application with USCIS requesting an asylum interview. In the defensive process, an undocumented applicant requests an asylum interview during immigration court removal proceedings. In both processes, the government is then legally required to at least grant them an interview to determine whether they have grounds for their asylum case to proceed."
social justice,"“For the past six years, the Asylum Division has received many more cases across all areas of its responsibilities than it has capacity to adjudicate. Nonetheless, the Asylum Division has actively pursued ways to effectively address the backlog,” Anita Rios Moore, a USCIS spokesperson, told HuffPost in an email."
social justice,"The majority of those asylum-seekers came from China, Venezuela and El Salvador. Unaccompanied minors from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras accounted for 92% of all unaccompanied child asylum applications in 2019 and made up the majority of affirmative asylum applicants from those countries."
social justice,"Requests for asylum have increased every year under both processes, leading to the current backlog. In 2019, USCIS granted asylum affirmatively to 27,643 people, an increase of 13% over 2018 and 77% from 2017, according to the most recent report from the Department of Homeland Security. The agency also documented an increase of defensive asylum applications for the fifth consecutive year, from just 47,100 applications in 2014 to more than 210,700 applications in 2019."
social justice,"These trends have contributed to the bureaucratic chaos the Biden administration inherited, but so have underfunding, lack of resources, constantly shifting enforcement strategies and other flawed policies."
social justice,"Trump’s policies made conditions even worse. The 2019 Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as “Remain in Mexico,” forced individuals to return to Mexico as they awaited court hearings. And Title 42, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention implemented in March 2020, allowed border officials to send back individuals at the border to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Biden has rolled back the migrant protocols but has continued using Title 42. In March, Customs and Border Patrol expelled 103,900 people, or 60% of the total number of encounters."
social justice,Trapped In Political And Legal Limbo 
social justice,"During both the Obama and Trump years, 89% of USCIS asylum officers were temporarily reassigned from handling asylum cases to other duties, the report notes. Under Obama, those officers were ordered to screen asylum-seekers placed in expedited removal proceedings, the process in which immigration officials rapidly decide whether or not an immigrant will be deported. An individual can only avoid deportation if they request asylum or express a fear of return to their home country, and are then referred to an asylum officer, who will conduct a credible fear interview — all of which take up substantial time and resources from asylum staff."
social justice,"“Even after reopening of the asylum offices, necessary health precautions allowed for only limited interviewing of cases in-person. This, of course, has resulted in even further delay in the adjudication of cases,” Moore said."
social justice,"From 1995 to 2014, USCIS scheduled asylum interviews in the order of “last in, first out” (LIFO), prioritizing newer applications. But the agency reversed that strategy in 2014 and began scheduling asylum interviews in the order they were received as the backlog began to grow. "
social justice,"Despite the fact the agency has increased the number of authorized asylum officers from 273 in 2013 to 771 in 2019, closures under COVID-19 slowed the review of asylum applications."
social justice,"Advocates said the change has left some asylum-seekers waiting for years for a decision. As of April 2021, 80% of Human Rights First’s more than 300 clients in the USCIS backlog have been waiting for more than two years for an interview, with an average wait time of more than four years."
social justice,"In January 2018, the agency reverted back to the old policy due to high application volumes and “to deter individuals from using asylum backlogs solely to obtain employment authorization by filing frivolous, fraudulent or otherwise non-meritorious asylum applications,” according to an announcement from the Trump administration."
social justice,"Those asylum-seekers are left feeling “powerless” and “stuck in this system without any way to move things along,” she said."
social justice,"“LIFO is a critical tool in controlling non-meritorious or fraudulent applications filed to take advantage of the backlog in order to obtain work authorization,” said Moore, noting that after reimposing LIFO, the number of affirmative asylum applications filed per year decreased and annual growth of the backlog has dropped. "
social justice,"But with the attention came threats; the Taliban accused him of being a foreign agent. In 2014, a group of assailants cornered and beat him and warned him to stop his political and social activities. A year later, armed men on motorcycles stopped the car he was riding in on his way home from a work meeting but Imran was able to hide. The armed men fired into the air and threatened to shoot him next. He knew he had to leave."
social justice,"“Historically USCIS had been receptive to processing expedited requests for family living in danger abroad, but many of the people that we spoke with for this report had not had their expedited requests approved,” said Anika Ades, a fellow with the organization’s refugee protection team. "
social justice,"Imran grew up in a politically engaged family and started a nonprofit organization focused on women’s rights in his district, at a time where the Taliban ruled and forbade women from receiving an education and working in politics. The organization grew, and he began working with other international humanitarian groups. "
social justice,"Among them is 47-year-old Imran, a political activist from Pakistan now living in New York. HuffPost has agreed to use a pseudonym, as he fears retaliation in his country of origin should his application be denied."
social justice,"“I still wanted to go back because I had my property, my life, over there. It was difficult to get work here without the appropriate authorization,” he said. “But ultimately, the situation was not getting better.”"
social justice,"Imran arrived in the U.S. in 2015, planning to stay for a few months until the situation calmed down. But his family and friends told him it was not safe for him to return. Even after he left, Imran’s relatives started receiving threatening phone calls asking about his whereabouts. "
social justice,He can’t work or pursue an education. He has relied heavily on other Pakistanis In New York for housing and support. 
social justice,"“During that time, a lot of schools were blown up and women weren’t allowed to go to schools. So we wanted to get women more involved, so mothers would be comfortable sending their daughters to school,” Imran told HuffPost via a translator over the phone. “We also wanted to work on political empowerment, because in national and local assemblies women did not have any representation.”"
social justice,"“Essentially there is no way out of this because you can’t go back and you’re not getting the benefits over here,” he said."
social justice,"After two years of waiting did he finally receive work authorization from USCIS, and got work as a security guard in a local mall. Then the pandemic hit, and he lost that job. He tries to stay active politically in New York, but he still worries about his wife and three children, who are still in Pakistan. His youngest daughter barely knows him, a pain that he says is killing him slowly."
social justice,"“If my family ends up in less than ideal circumstances or under bad influences, then there’s no point in living for me,” said Imran."
social justice,"The inability to work, fear of deportation and ongoing family separation are also a heavy mental burden for asylum-seekers. "
social justice,Surviving Trauma
social justice,"Smith, who runs a support group for French-speaking African torture survivors, said the latest change in how asylum cases are reviewed directly impacted clients who were at their breaking point. They don’t pick up the phone when loved ones call because they don’t have updates; it’s difficult to listen to their crying children who want to know when they can see them again."
social justice,"Hawthorne Smith is the director of the Bellevue Program for Survivors of Torture or PSOT, an interdisciplinary program based at Bellevue Hospital and associated with NYU School of Medicine in New York. The program has worked with more than 6,000 torture survivors from over 112 countries, the majority of whom are asylum-seekers. "
social justice,"“We’ve been doing this now for 25 years, so it’s always been difficult, but what has happened over these last three years has really been unconscionable,” said Smith."
social justice,"While the “first in, first out” policy had its flaws, it made sense, Smith said. But now Smith has clients who applied for asylum years ago and are still waiting for their initial interview."
social justice,"Other clients have contemplated dropping their asylum cases entirely just to return to their home countries and see their families, despite the threats on their lives."
social justice,"Azeem, a journalist from Bangladesh facing government persecution for his work, fled to the U.S. in April 2016. He is also using a pseudonym due to fears of retaliation. The government had tried to censor his coverage of social and political crises, and in 2015 he was arrested and charged with sedition after his network aired a speech of the opposition party. The chair of his network was also arrested, part of an ongoing crackdown on free speech in the country as documented by the nonprofit Human Rights Watch."
social justice,"Azeem was blinded, handcuffed and tortured while in police custody and later put into jail for nine months. When he developed severe chest pains, hospitals refused to treat him because of orders from government officials. He didn’t think he would make it out alive. When the government finally released him, he initially resisted the idea of leaving his country. But he knew if he didn’t, the government would come back for him. He left his pregnant wife behind and fled to the U.S. with $1,000 in his pocket."
social justice,"“I took that risk to save my life,” Azeem told HuffPost. In the U.S., it took him two years to get an answer about whether he would be granted asylum. He found himself triggered whenever he saw a police car and struggled with severe post-traumatic stress-like symptoms."
social justice,"“I don’t know how I managed or how I will manage everything. A new life, new culture, new language, a new environment,” he said. “This is all utterly unexplainable mental pressure.”"
social justice,"“People are oppressed and people are tortured, this is why most people come to the U.S. ― to save their lives,” he said."
social justice,It wasn’t until nearly four years later that his wife and children were able to join him. He still struggles to create new memories with them ― making up for the lost time while beginning a new life in a new country.
social justice,"Azeem considers himself among the lucky ones, but said without support, surviving the backlog would have been impossible. He said he hopes that U.S. immigration sees the human toll behind its policies in order to change it for those vulnerable like himself."
social justice,"Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Sunday defended the Biden administration’s handling of a surge of migrants that have overwhelmed the nation’s immigration system, while also declaring that the U.S.-Mexico border “is closed” and only unaccompanied minors will be allowed in."
social justice,"“The message is quite clear: Do not come. The border is closed, the border is secure,” Mayorkas said on ABC’s “This Week.” “We are rebuilding the system as we address the needs of vulnerable children who arrive at our borders.”"
social justice,"Mayorkas’ message follows U.S. border agents apprehending more than 100,000 migrants last month, 28 percent more than the previous month. The last time U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported such figures was in the spring of 2019, according to the CBP’s online figures."
social justice,"Despite the surge, and immigration officials halting the acceptance of adults and families, the Biden administration has refused to label the current situation a “crisis,” a term that Mayorkas again on Sunday deflected."
social justice,"Mayorkas defended the decision to allow unaccompanied minors in a separate interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press,” saying it would be inhumane to turn them away into the Mexican desert."
social justice,Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) on Sunday shared a similar sentiment.
social justice,"Republicans on Sunday accused the Biden administration of actually encouraging the rush of migrants, particularly by allowing refuge to unaccompanied minors. "
social justice,Mayorkas blamed the previous Trump administration for both the rise in cases and for the immigration system’s inability to handle it all.
social justice,"He argued that people have been increasingly forced to flee their countries and seek refuge in the U.S. because the Trump administration cut off humanitarian aid to their countries, making an already dire situation worse. Mayorkas also accused the previous administration of dismantling the immigration system amid a pandemic."
social justice,"“We are rebuilding those orderly systems both in Mexico, in close partnerships with the Mexican government, and in the countries of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador,” he said in his interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press.”"
social justice,"Career immigration officials had warned of a potential migrant surge after the November presidential election and news that Trump’s hardline immigration policies were being reversed, the Associated Press reported."
social justice,"“They see him as the migrant president,” Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said of President Joe Biden following a virtual meeting with his U.S. counterpart on March 1. “And so many feel they’re going to reach the United States.”"
social justice,"“The border is wide open,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.” “He’s basically saying that the U.S. will not secure our border and that is a big welcome sign to migrants from across the world.”"
social justice,"“I will not use language that is not applicable,” he said on MSNBC’s “The Sunday Show.” “We have dealt with surges in migration at the border before. We have a plan, we are executing our plan, we will succeed. We know what to do, we are doing it, and that is the fact of the matter.”"
social justice,"Billionaires in the U.S. have grown their wealth by nearly 45% — or by more than $1.3 trillion — since the COVID-19 pandemic hit the nation last March, according to a new report. "
social justice,"“Encouraging these kids to come is not a humane thing,” Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio), the leading Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “It’s certainly overwhelming our system.”"
social justice,"Meanwhile, over the past year, the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic has left tens of millions of Americans unemployed and struggling financially. "
social justice,"More than two months into Joe Biden’s presidency, former President Donald Trump’s choices are still undermining the State Department, frustrating administration officials and victims of Trump-era moves such as his harsh crackdown on immigration."
social justice,"More than 542,000 people have died in the U.S. since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. "
social justice,"Among those who’ve seen their wealth grow the most in the last 12 months are Tesla founder Elon Musk, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Facebook head Mark Zuckerberg."
social justice,A spokesperson for Amazon told HuffPost that starting pay was $15.30 per hour and that the company “offers some of the best jobs available.”
social justice,As Bezos has seen his net worth swell from $113 billion at the start of the pandemic to over $178 billion a year later — or a 58% increase — Amazon has been aggressively working to quash unionization efforts at its Alabama warehouse. Workers there are fighting for better pay and working conditions. 
social justice,"A report released by the Institute for Policy Studies and Americans for Tax Fairness on Tuesday tracked the net worth of the wealthiest Americans from March 18, 2020 to March 18, 2021, and found that 43 people had joined the billionaire ranks over this past year, based on data from Forbes."
social justice,"“The pandemic profiteers are extracting windfalls of wealth during a time of widespread suffering for the majority of people,” Chuck Collins, director of IPS’s program on inequality, said in a release."
social justice,"The U.S. unemployment rate was over 6% last month — with about 10 million people considered unemployed — far above the levels of last February, when unemployment was around 3.5% and about 5.7 million were counted as unemployed."
social justice,"“There is a whole lot of diplomatic disappointment at the State Department and our embassies,” said Brett Bruen, a White House official under Obama and former diplomat."
social justice,"The Trump administration’s reluctance to acknowledge the results of the 2020 election is at the root of the problem, observers say. Because General Services Administration head Emily Murphy waited until nearly three weeks after Election Day to begin cooperating with Biden’s transition team, the incoming president was delayed in providing the names of prospective nominees to the FBI for background checks."
social justice,"The slow pace of staffing the State Department is particularly worrying for two groups of experts on U.S. foreign policy: the agency’s career staff, and outside national security analysts hoping to help Biden fulfill his promise to bolster diplomacy and improve America’s handling of global affairs."
social justice,"Meanwhile, professionals in the foreign and civil service are watching as key roles go to politically connected figures. Former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is a leading candidate to be the ambassador to China or Japan, for instance, and Cindy McCain ― the widow of Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and one of the few Republicans to endorse Biden ― is certain to get a plum posting."
social justice,"Biden’s own approach to appointing top officials is contributing to the problem, critics say, preventing the State Department from making critical progress."
social justice,Turning Off Talent
social justice,"The president has yet to nominate anyone for the vast majority of posts he needs to fill at the agency, including the 22 assistant secretary positions that oversee State Department bureaus. He isn’t expected to tap his first slate of ambassadors until next month ― a full month later than President Barack Obama. And he has yet to give big jobs or a boost to career State Department employees who felt harassed, demoralized and undervalued under Trump."
social justice,"The upshot is that the procedure became “abnormally long,” even for former officials receiving new positions like U.S. Agency for International Development administrator nominee Samantha Power, said a congressional aide who requested anonymity to discuss the sensitive confirmation process."
social justice,"If Biden chose, he could speed up the process by sending more nominations to Capitol Hill so consideration could begin even before their paperwork was fully completed, the aide added, noting that the president hasn’t yet identified candidates for many senior posts."
social justice,"“It’s frustrating; there is no way around it,” the aide said. “Putting ascertainment delays aside, we wish there were more positions filled at this point.” "
social justice,"“Addressing and filling vital senior leadership positions at the State Department is one of the Secretary’s highest and most immediate priorities, and the Department is working closely with the White House to identify and select qualified candidates.”"
social justice,A State Department spokesperson told HuffPost that Secretary of State Antony Blinken sees the agency’s staff as its “greatest asset.”
social justice,"Biden had said “current career officials would be elevated and empowered under this Administration,” Bruen told HuffPost via email. “Where the heck are they? Not one of them have been named to a leadership position at the State Department.” "
social justice,He noted that only one senior White House national security post is held by a State Department official. 
social justice,"Until the department gets more high-ranking officials who are fully empowered and have the benefit of Senate confirmation, it’s hard for diplomats to map out next steps for their careers and to have influence in crafting Biden’s policies. "
social justice,"“Under Secretary Blinken’s leadership, career experts will always be at the center of our diplomacy, and he is committed to ensuring that they will help to lead it by serving in many of the Department’s most senior positions,” the spokesperson wrote in an email. "
social justice,"Beyond Foggy Bottom, aspiring officials who have cultivated international relations expertise but were reluctant to serve under Trump say the delay in appointments and Biden’s reliance on Obama-era personnel has led to confusion and a sense that it’s futile to continue to focus on government appointments over other opportunities. "
social justice,"Adding to career staffers’ concerns, Biden quickly selected aides for many White House national security jobs that do not require Senate consideration, possibly signaling he will continue the long-running trend of empowering the National Security Council to lead on foreign affairs rather than the State Department."
social justice,"“It’s a black box… [and] it’s especially bad at State,” said one national security analyst who sought anonymity to preserve relationships."
social justice,"Even figures with State Department backgrounds who already have or are expected to get high-profile posts, such as Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Victoria Nuland and Nicholas Burns, have cultivated strong political links apart from serving in government and rising through standard promotion procedures."
social justice,That uncertainty is driving fears that Biden will ignore new approaches to international relations and calls to include a more diverse range of voices in policy-making.
social justice,"The analyst said they and many of their peers were considering taking their skills elsewhere, outside Washington and government work. "
social justice,"The staffing delays may have ripple effects for people all over the world, dashing hopes of a quick and clear turn away from Trump’s disdain for most foreigners."
social justice,The White House did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
social justice,Delaying Dreams
social justice,"“I talk to people all the time who have incredible backgrounds, and they have no idea how to go around getting in,” the analyst continued. “There is going to be a loss of talent at some point if a lot of the new next-generation thinkers get written off.” "
social justice,"In 2019, Mohamed Haggag, a 30-year-old engineer in Egypt, was one of thousands of people worldwide who won the U.S.’s annual visa lottery, which provides a pathway to move to America. But just months later, Trump stopped U.S. embassies from issuing new visas, saying more immigration would harm U.S. workers struggling during the coronavirus pandemic. "
social justice,Haggag said he expected “things under Biden would get better.” And the new president did revoke one of Trump’s pandemic barriers to entry last month. 
social justice,"But that didn’t mean diversity visa hopefuls like Haggag could get back on track. He and others are still fighting in court for the right to even apply for the visa, despite their wins. Meanwhile, Biden’s State Department has said it will not issue visas to people who won the lottery for 2020 “as the deadlines for visa issuance in those fiscal years have expired.”"
social justice,It said that applied to lottery winners going back to 2017 ― confirming that it would not provide U.S. diversity visas to tens of thousands of lottery winners who were unable to obtain the visas they were entitled to because of Trump’s travel ban mainly targeting Muslim-majority countries. 
social justice,"Manar Waheed, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, said there is more the State Department could do."
social justice,"“This does not have to be a closed issue,” she said, arguing that the State Department could offer humanitarian parole to diversity visa winners as a temporary solution, enabling them to begin the process of moving as lawmakers tweak to the lottery rules to permit them to become U.S. citizens."
social justice,"“This once-in-a-lifetime opportunity is something that can allow them to build lives in safety,” Waheed said."
social justice,The American Civil Liberties Union also wants Biden to address other consequences of Trump-era policies to reduce immigration by expediting the processing of visa applications and reopening those that were denied to people simply on the basis of their nationality under Trump’s travel ban.
social justice,"Still, for people hoping for sweeping change from the new administration, a long wait seems inevitable."
social justice,"With a backlog of tens of thousands of visa applications, however, and limited political power at the State Department so far, it’s hard to imagine the Biden administration pulling off a broad redo of Trump’s clampdown."
social justice,"“We continue to have a deep bench of experienced career professionals serving in key positions that are highly capable and able to help the Secretary lead the Department,” the agency spokesperson wrote to HuffPost."
social justice,Rowaida Abdelaziz contributed reporting.
social justice,"“I only do two things in my life: I work and I follow the lottery news in America,” Haggag said."
social justice,"Texas Sen. John Cornyn was slammed on Monday after he dared to criticize President Joe Biden’s immigration policies as, uh, “humane.”"
social justice,"Yes, you read that right. "
social justice,The Republican politician griped about Biden’s compassion via a Twitter thread that started with Cornyn citing the border policies of the previous two Democratic presidents. 
social justice,"By comparison, Cornyn’s lack of enthusiasm for Biden’s border policy came down to the president’s insistence on compassion."
social justice,Many Twitter users immediately took Cornyn to task for being against basic human courtesy.
social justice,"“Saturday Night Live” cast member Bowen Yang began his “Weekend Update” bit against Asian American attacks all attitude and eye rolls, but ended with a powerful message to “fuel up” and keep moving — together."
social justice,Yang first dinged co-anchor Colin Jost for introducing him as the program’s “Asian American cast member.” 
social justice,"“I set your ass up. It feels good,” Yang replied."
social justice,Jost responded: “That’s how you told me to introduce you.”
social justice,"But Yang got serious. “Things for Asians in this country have been bleak for the past two weeks — and all the weeks before that since forever,” he noted."
social justice,"He said he didn’t know what to say to help change “how insanely bad things are. If someone’s personality is ‘punch an Asian grandma,’ it’s not a dialogue. I have an Asian grandma. You want to punch her? There ain’t no common ground, Mama,” said Yang."
social justice,"He added: “I’m just a comedian. I don’t have all the answers. But I’m not just looking for them online. I’m looking around me. The GoFundMe for Xiao Zhen Xie, the grandmother who fought back against her attacker, raised $900,000, which she immediately gave back to the community. That’s where we are as Asians. Now come meet us there.”"
social justice,Yang said he tries to live by a Mandarin cheer that means “fuel up.”
social justice,"“I don’t know what’s helpful to say to everyone, but that’s what I say to myself. Fuel up, do more,” he added. “It’s the year of the metal ox, which basically means a car. So everyone, get in, buckle up. It’s no pee breaks. We ride at dawn, Grandma!”"
social justice,Fox News host Jeanine Pirro indulged in yet another racist diatribe Monday as she railed against the Biden administration’s handling of the migrant surge at the southern border.
social justice,"“The bringing of these children into this country, where they will be forever connected to a cartel, is slavery,” she said. “What we’re doing here is we are promoting a lower level of human being, who will be controlled from other countries.”"
social justice,"On “The Five,” Pirro argued that during a recent trip to the area, she saw that the border was open."
social justice,Check it out in the video clip up top. 
social justice,"“So stop trying to make this about this is who ― not who we are,” she added. “This is about crime coming into this country and it’s a reality. And we’re losing.”"
social justice,"President Joe Biden’s administration has been struggling to deal with an uptick in migrants trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border. It is still expelling most adults and families, however, children have been allowed to stay."
social justice,"A number of critics on social media called out her “lower level of human being” comment as overt white supremacy and likened it to Nazi rhetoric. A key tenet of Nazi ideology was to define and portray Jews as untermenschen, or subhuman. It’s the second time this month Pirro has been compared to Nazis over her remarks on immigration. "
social justice,"Republicans have blamed Biden, saying the reversal of his predecessor Donald Trump’s harsh immigration policies was drawing more migrants to the border. The Biden administration has dismissed that, arguing that they were left with a broken and inhumane system."
social justice,"Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) on Friday blasted Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in a Twitter tirade, accusing him of fearmongering about an increase of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border instead of focusing on issues directly affecting his constituents."
social justice,"“You’re in a Border Patrol boat armed with machine guns,” O’Rourke wrote in response to footage that Cruz had shared of himself at the shores of the Rio Grande, supposedly observing Mexican cartel members on the other side. “The only threat you face is unarmed children and families who are seeking asylum (as well as the occasional heckler). If you’re looking for a crisis to cosplay Senator for, I’m happy to point you in the right direction.”"
social justice,"O’Rourke, who failed to unseat Cruz in a heated 2018 Senate race, went on to highlight a number of other Texas issues that he said Cruz was ignoring in lieu of harping on immigration woes at the border ― including mass shootings, the minimum wage and a lack of accessible health care."
social justice,"“The truth is, the number of individual asylum seekers and immigrants seeking to come to this country is the SAME or LOWER than it was in 2019 when Trump was President (and you were, apparently, Senator),” O’Rourke wrote. “This isn’t any more of a crisis today than it was then.”"
social justice,"O’Rourke has not been the only one to level criticism at Cruz, who’s been touring the U.S.-Mexico border with 18 other Republican senators, including Sen. Lindsay Graham (S.C.), and blaming the Biden administration for a “humanitarian crisis.”"
social justice,"Cruz’s detractors argue that the senator was not nearly as vocal about such conditions when the Trump administration was enforcing family separation at the border. They’ve also highlighted his getaway to Cancun, Mexico, last month when millions of Texans were left without power due to extreme weather."
social justice,"The former representative has acknowledged the large numbers of migrants at the southern border this year, but argued that it is merely representative of a larger problem. He said the U.S. must work more closely with Central American governments and NGOs, and “rewrite our immigration laws to reflect the priority of family reunification, the contributions of millions of hardworking Americans who lack documentation and status in this country, & our desire to ensure a safe, legal path to come to this country.”"
social justice,"O’Rourke, who was one of many Democratic presidential hopefuls in the 2020 cycle, has frequently criticized Texas Republican leadership, arguing that “stupid culture battles” have turned the Lone Star State into a “failed state” and obscured more pressing problems, such as COVID-19 vaccine distribution and the local impact of the pandemic."
social justice,"Migrant numbers at the southern border are currently lower than the peaks reached two years ago, according to an analysis by CNN. That said, in May 2019, 11,475 unaccompanied minors were taken into federal custody, more than in any other month that year ― and in February 2021, more than 9,200 unaccompanied minors were arrested, a sign that this is already a heavy year for minors at the border."
social justice,"Republican lawmakers have been quick to criticize the Biden administration for struggling to handle the increase of people attempting to enter the U.S., though a number of reasons have contributed to this rise ― including COVID-19’s impact on Latin America and Hurricanes Eta and Iota, which struck the region in quick succession in November."
social justice,"CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Texans who were recently left without power due to extreme weather. There were millions of such people, not hundreds of millions."
social justice,"Kamala Harris will lead efforts to control the surge of migrants at the southern border, giving the vice president leadership over one of the administration’s most high-profile challenges. "
social justice,"“This new surge we are dealing with now started in the past administration, but it is our responsibility,” President Joe Biden said Wednesday. He added that he could think of “nobody who is better qualified to do this.”"
social justice,"The migration challenge is the first issue Biden has publicly asked Harris to lead, and it’s one he oversaw while serving as vice president under Barack Obama. "
social justice,"Biden’s administration has been facing criticism from both parties over the unaccompanied children and teenagers coming across the U.S.-Mexico border, particularly for the crowded facilities where they are being held. "
social justice,"There are more than 14,000 migrant children in federal care right now."
social justice,Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas has acknowledged that the U.S. is “on pace to encounter more individuals on the southwest border than we have in the last 20 years.”
social justice,"Harris will oversee the administration’s diplomatic efforts with the “Northern Triangle” countries — El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras — and work with them on both short- and long-term solutions to reduce migration to the United States. Her focus will be addressing the root causes that push people to come to the country."
social justice,"In an interview with CBS on Wednesday before the announcement, Harris said she and Biden will go down to the border “at some point,” emphasizing that solving the problem will not happen overnight. "
social justice,"“Look, we’ve been in office less than 100 days,” she said. “We are addressing it. We’re dealing with it. But it’s going to take some time. And are we frustrated? Are you frustrated? Yes, we are.”"
social justice,"“She comes into this partnership with the goals of trying to enhance prosperity, combat corruption and strengthen good governance and the rule of law. And those are the goals of the countries themselves,” an administration official told reporters. "
social justice,"In March 2020, then-President Donald Trump invoked Title 42, a provision from a 1944 public health law that allowed him to send undocumented immigrants back to their home countries under the pretense of halting the spread of COVID-19. "
social justice,Mayorkas said Sunday that migrants should not be coming to the country without documentation ― but that the Biden administration would not be returning to the Trump policy of sending back children.
social justice,Biden is continuing Title 42 restrictions for most adults and some families ― a policy being challenged in court ― but he is allowing minors to stay in the U.S. That decision has led to unaccompanied minors being detained at the border as they await room in shelters or being placed with their family or sponsors in the United States. 
social justice,"“The border is closed,” he said. “We are expelling families. We are expelling single adults. And we’ve made a decision that we will not expel young, vulnerable children. I think we are executing on our plans. And quite frankly, when we are finished doing so, the American public will look back on this and say we secured our border and we upheld our values and our principles as a nation.”"
social justice,"Asked Tuesday when Biden will make good on his promise to restore refugee admissions, senior Democratic lawmakers said they don’t know when or what the reason is for the delay."
social justice,"“They have consulted with us, talked about the numbers and their dramatic change in the Trump era. But in terms of the actual implementation of that, I don’t know their time table,” Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told HuffPost. "
social justice,"Nearly a month after announcing the administration’s plans to raise the refugee cap, Biden has yet to formally sign off on the higher cap including 125,000 for the next fiscal year and an additional 62,500 refugees to be admitted this year. Without Biden’s signature on it, refugee admissions are forced to abide by the record low cap set by former president Donald Trump and exclude refugees from several Muslim majority countries. "
social justice,"Refugees around the world are in the dark on when Joe Biden’s administration will lift the U.S. cap on resettlement admissions ― and congressional Democrats are, too. "
social justice,"Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a leading critic of the Trump administration’s years-long war on refugee admissions, said she has heard “nothing” from the White House about the matter. "
social justice,"“I think they ought to put out a public assessment of where they are on these issues because people have different views based on different facts,” Feinstein added of the administration."
social justice,"As of March, more than 700 refugees who had been approved and booked to arrive in the U.S. had their flights canceled at the last minute, and more cancellations are expected."
social justice,"“The President is committed to strengthening the operations of the United States Refugee Admissions Program. While no firm numbers have been finalized, the President’s view is clear: This program will reflect the generosity and core values of the United States while benefiting from the many contributions that refugees make to our country,” a White House spokesperson told HuffPost in an email. "
social justice,Many refugees are operating on expiring medical and security clearances that will likely upend a refugee’s admission to the country if they don’t board a plane on time. 
social justice,"Asked about the refugee admissions cap, Ambassador Roberta Jacobson, Biden’s coordinator for the southern border, told CNN, “I’m sure we will be acting on that ... but we’re doing so in a deliberate way.” "
social justice,Refugees across the world sold their belongings and traveled for miles to escape perilous conditions in anticipation of boarding their flights only to be told to go back to refugee camps. Families in the U.S. also bought new apartments and furnishings in preparation for the arrivals of their loved ones who haven’t come.
social justice,The cancellations also reignited severe mental and emotional anguish for families who had their flights canceled several times due to the pandemic and previous legal challenges caused by Trump. 
social justice,"Biden has faced intensifying criticism ― including from some in his party ― over his handling of the surge of migrant children to the U.S.-Mexico border. The administration recently dispatched the Federal Emergency Management Agency to help care for the growing number of children arriving at the border and opened a large convention center in Dallas to house them. Sensing a political opportunity, dozens of congressional Republicans have traveled to the border to highlight the situation, which they blamed on the Biden administration’s immigration policies."
social justice,"When asked if he thought the border influx was a factor in the delay of restarting refugee admissions, Durbin said, “I don’t know what the logic is behind it.” He added he was eager to hear more from the Homeland Security Department. "
social justice,"“Every day the Biden administration lets this directive stand, it perpetuates the harm caused by former President Trump’s unlawful purpose of excluding Muslims,” said Justin Cox, the senior litigation attorney at the International Refugee Assistance Project. “With the stroke of a pen, President Biden could immediately remedy some of the devastating effects the previous administration has had and help Muslim and other refugee families in need of protection.”"
social justice,"But Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), who was a refugee in Kenya before she relocated to the United States, urged the Biden administration to do more to help refugees by lifting the cap. "
social justice,"Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), another leading refugee advocate, said restarting U.S. admissions will be difficult regardless of when the cap is lifted due to the lack of funding for networks dedicated to the resettlement of families, such as nonprofit organizations and faith-based groups. He said the situation “deserves to be redressed and I’m confident that Congress and the administration will work through this together and we’ll change direction.”"
social justice,"But the bills are likely to stall out in the Senate, which Democrats narrowly control ― making the chances for immigration reform unlikely given heavy Republican opposition."
social justice,"The House passed the American Dream and Promise Act in a 228-197 vote, with nine Republicans voting in favor. The bill would provide a path to citizenship for the 2.5 million young undocumented migrants known as “Dreamers,” as well as the 400,000 immigrants living in the country with temporary protected status, or TPS."
social justice,"The House passed two major immigration reform bills on Thursday, securing the first step in President Joe Biden’s plan to grant a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented people."
social justice,"The chamber later approved a second bill, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, in a 247-174 vote. Thirty Republicans voted to approve the bill and one Democrat ― Rep. Jared Golden of Maine ― voted no. "
social justice,That second bill would allow eligible undocumented farmworkers to apply for legal status and is the biggest legalization effort with broad Republican support. A majority of the country’s roughly 2.4 million farmworkers are undocumented.
social justice,Both bills have support from the White House. 
social justice,"The bills would be life-changing for undocumented immigrants. While many Dreamers are currently protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, they remain at risk of deportation and lack permanent status."
social justice,"“Ensuring that Dreamers and TPS recipients have a clear path to citizenship would deliver much-needed economic security and stability to millions of people who currently face perpetual uncertainty and vulnerability as a result of their immigration status,” read a statement from the White House released on Thursday. "
social justice,Biden urged all members of the House to vote in favor of the bills in a tweet and said it was “long past time Congress gives a path to citizenship for Dreamers and TPS recipients who strengthen our country and call our nation home.”
social justice,"It has been more than three decades since Congress enacted broad immigration reforms, and anything proposed since then has struggled to gain enough support. In 2019, both bills passed the House at the time but were never taken up in the then-Republican-led Senate for a vote."
social justice,"But immigration reform is always a heavy lift in Congress ― and particularly now, after former President Donald Trump spent years pushing anti-immigrant and restrictionist policies with the support of most Republicans. "
social justice,"Earlier this week, Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told reporters that he was not optimistic of the legislation garnering enough bipartisan support."
social justice,"The vote comes at a time where the Biden administration is facing scrutiny amid the biggest surge of migrants at its southwestern border in 20 years. More than 100,000 migrants were apprehended at the border with Mexico in February, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Another several thousand unaccompanied minors were also in CBP custody as of last Sunday held in shocking conditions, prompting outrage from lawmakers and activists alike."
social justice,"“I don’t see a means of reaching that,” said Durbin, who has been championing protections for Dreamers for two decades. “I want it. I think we are much more likely to deal with discrete elements” of such a plan."
social justice,"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), an immigration reform supporter-turned Trump ally who co-sponsored the Dream Act with Durbin, said Wednesday that Republicans will not work on immigration measures without changes in border policy. "
social justice,"During the floor vote Thursday, Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) stated that the issue at the border was not an excuse."
social justice,"“The Biden administration is creating chaos where there was order,” Graham said. “The only way we’ll be able to sit down with our Democratic colleagues is for us to regain control of the border.”"
social justice,Members of the House of Representatives plan to vote on two immigration reform bills this week as a part of President Joe Biden’s sweeping agenda to grant a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented people.
social justice,"“I have no doubt that some of my Republican colleagues will stand before us today and use what they claim as a crisis at the border as an excuse not to support this bill,” he said. “But let’s get one thing straight. This legislation is not about the border. This legislation is about finally delivering on our promise to America’s dreamers and others who are equally deserving of our protection.”"
social justice,"The bills are Democrats’ first attempts to see what progress, if any, they can make on immigration under Biden as a wave of migrants and asylum-seekers, many of them unaccompanied children, arrive at the border."
social justice,"It has been more than three decades since Congress enacted broad immigration reforms, and anything proposed since then has struggled to gain enough support. Biden’s proposed reforms would be the largest legislative overhaul of the U.S. immigration system since Republican President Ronald Reagan’s administration. "
social justice,"Biden’s approach begins with the American Dream and Promise Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for the 2.5 million young undocumented migrants known as “Dreamers,” as well as the 4000,000 immigrants living in the country with temporary protected status."
social justice,"The second bill, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, would allow eligible undocumented farmworkers to apply for legal status and is the biggest legalization effort with broad Republican support. "
social justice,Both bills passed the House in 2019 but were never taken up in the then-Republican-led Senate for a vote.
social justice,"Democrats are hoping that by breaking Biden’s immigration plans into several smaller bills, they are more likely to succeed in the Senate. Still, the smaller bills are likely to face roadblocks."
social justice,"Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, told reporters on Tuesday that a comprehensive approach, even with a Democratic majority, “is still a very difficult thing to achieve” and that members of the GOP are likely to prioritize the surge of migrants at the border. "
social justice,"“I’m reaching out on the Republican side. Many of them have said they are focused on the southern border, and I think that has to be part of the conversation,” said Durbin."
social justice,"“Their immigration strategy is exactly the same thing as their Covid strategy. Do nothing. Just let people die. P.S. @GOPLeader stop using my community as your prop,” tweeted Rep. Veronica Escobar (D-Texas), who represents the El Paso district that includes the detention center."
social justice,"On Monday, a dozen GOP House members, including House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (D-Calif.), slammed Biden’s approach after visiting a detention center on the U.S.-Mexico border, an event Democrats and immigration activists dismissed as a political stunt."
social justice,The Biden administration also announced on Monday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency is stepping in to help manage and care for unaccompanied immigrant children at the border. 
social justice,"Meanwhile, on the Hill, the Biden administration faces criticism across the political spectrum."
social justice,"Centrist Democrats are split over the strategy to move forward with a piecemeal legislative approach in order to garner Republic support, while progressives are calling for their moderate colleagues to act decisively and have expressed concern they will accept watered-down immigration bills."
social justice,"“We have a lot of critics, but many of them are not putting forward a lot of solutions,” said press secretary Jen Psaki on Monday."
social justice,"Meanwhile, many immigration activists have turned their criticism to the situation at the border and the Biden administration’s detention of unaccompanied migrant children in crowded cells for longer than is legally allowed. More than 4,000 children were being held at Border Patrol stations and facilities as of last weekend."

social justice,"Sandra Oh is calling for an end to anti-Asian violence in the wake of the shooting rampage in three Atlanta-area spas this week that left eight people dead, including six women of Asian descent. "
social justice,The “Grey’s Anatomy” alum joined thousands across the country who rallied in various cities over the weekend to demand justice for the victims of the shootings and decry the recent surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans. 
social justice,"On Saturday, Oh made a surprise appearance at a Stop Asian Hate rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where she’s currently filming her new Netflix series “The Chair.”"
social justice,"After introducing herself and thanking the organizers for giving supporters the “opportunity to be together, stand together and feel each other,” Oh addressed the crowd with a brief but stirring speech. "
social justice,"“For many of us in our community, this is the first time we are even able to voice our fear and our anger, and I really am so grateful for everyone willing to listen,” Oh, holding a megaphone, said in videos, which have been widely shared across social media. “One thing that I know is that many in our community are very scared, and I understand that. And one way to go through our fear is to reach out to our community.”"
social justice,"“To everyone here … I will challenge everyone here, if you see something, will you help me? If you see one of our sisters and brothers in need, will you help us?” she said, as the people chanted, “Yes!” in response. “We must understand, as Asian Americans, we just need to reach out our hand to our sisters and brothers and say, ‘Help me and I’m here.’”"
social justice,"Oh concluded her speech by yelling, “I am proud to be Asian! I belong here!” before encouraging other community members to do the same. "
social justice,"“Many of us don’t get that chance to be able to say that, so I just wanted to give us an opportunity to be able to shout that,” she said. "
social justice,"Days before the rally, Oh posted on Instagram about the Atlanta shootings with a message directing her followers to support and donate to several organizations benefitting the Asian community."
social justice,"The “Killing Eve” star is one of a slew of celebrities to condemn anti-Asian violence in recent days. Gemma Chan, Lana Condor, Rihanna, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Ariana Grande, Daniel Dae Kim and others have spoken out publicly against the attacks. "
social justice,"“Please pay attention to what is happening. This is the latest in a surge of horrific attacks on the Asian community,” Chan wrote on Instagram earlier this week. “Racism and misogyny are not mutually exclusive. In fact, sexualised racial harassment and violence is something that many of us face regularly.”"
social justice,"“Wake up… your Asian friends and family are deeply scared, horrified, sick to their stomachs, and wildly angry,” Condor added in a separate post. “Please please please check in on us, please please please stand with us. Please. Your Asian friend needs you, even if they aren’t publicly grieving on social media.”"
social justice,"Earlier this week, Kim made an appearance in front of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties to urge lawmakers to pass bills addressing racism and discrimination against Asian Americans."
social justice,"“There are several moments in a country’s history that chart its course indelibly for the future. For Asian Americans, that moment is now,” the Korean-American actor said in his speech. “What happens right now and over the course of the coming months will send a message for generations to come as to whether we matter, whether the country we call home chooses to erase us or include us, dismiss us or respect us, invisibilize us or see us. Because you may consider us statistically insignificant now, but one more fact that has no alternative is that we are the fastest-growing racial demographic in the country. We are 23 million strong. We are united, and we are waking up.”"
social justice,"Rep. Marilyn Strickland (D-Wash.) condemned the mass-shooting deaths of six Asian women in Georgia, saying Wednesday that “racially motivated violence must be called out for exactly what it is.”"
social justice,"A day after police arrested a white man, Robert Aaron Long, for shooting and killing eight people — including six women of Asian descent — at three massage spas in Georgia, Strickland spoke from the House floor to give her “deepest condolences” to the families of the victims."
social justice,"“Racially motivated violence must be called out for exactly what it is, and we must stop making excuses or rebranding it as economic anxiety or sexual addiction,” said Strickland, who is the first ever Korean American woman in Congress and the first Black member from Washington. Four of the women killed were reportedly Korean."
social justice,"“As a woman who is Black and Korean I’m acutely aware of how it feels to be erased and ignored,” she said."
social justice,Law enforcement officials said Wednesday that it was “too early” to say whether the shootings were racially motivated and that Long told investigators he has “sexual addiction” issues and targeted the spas to “take out that temptation.” Law enforcement described Tuesday as a “really bad day” — for the shooter.
social justice,"Strickland noted that the attack was part of a “meteoric rise of violence” against Asian Americans over the past year, and that too often “the default position when violence is committed against people of color or women is to defer from confronting the hate that is often the motivation.”"
social justice,"Since last March, a coalition of Asian American advocacy groups called Stop AAPI Hate has been collecting reports of racist incidents. By the end of last month, it had recorded an alarming 3,795 reports of racist violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders who had been called racial slurs, spat on, physically assaulted and even killed. And women made up two-thirds of those targeted by the reported anti-Asian racism."
social justice,"Since the start of 2020, Asian Americans have reported a surge in racist attacks and harassment, often related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Hate crimes targeting members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community rose by 150% in major U.S. cities last year, per a report by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University."
social justice,"There is a long, ongoing history of Asian women being fetishized and sexualized in the U.S. and globally — and this intersects directly with racism."
social justice,"Gregory Alan Bush pleaded guilty to federal hate crimes on Thursday for shooting and killing two Black people at a Kroger grocery store in Kentucky in 2018, and attempting to murder a third."
social justice,"The 53-year-old white Louisville resident previously pleaded guilty but mentally ill to state charges for murder, attempted murder and wanton endangerment, and was sentenced to a life term in state prison."
social justice,"Bush admitted in his plea hearing Thursday to having shot and killed Maurice Stallard, a 69-year-old Black man, at close range on Oct. 24, 2018. Stallard was shopping with his grandson in the store."
social justice,"After Bush’s first encounter, he exited the store and walked up to a Black woman in the parking lot, shooting and killing 67-year-old Vickie Lee Jones."
social justice,Bush said he had no prior relationship with either individual and targeted both victims because of their perceived race.
social justice,He attempted to murder a third individual ― a Black man armed with a legal handgun who exchanged gunfire with Bush in the parking lot ― but was unsuccessful.
social justice,"After his third encounter, another armed man, who was white, confronted Bush in the parking lot. Bush responded, “Don’t shoot me [and] I won’t shoot you. Whites don’t shoot whites,” according to authorities."
social justice,"Bush attempted to enter a predominantly Black church in the area that day before he drove to the Kroger, but was unable to gain entry, police said at the time."
social justice,"Bush is scheduled to be sentenced in federal court this June, where he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment without parole. "
social justice,"“It won’t bring back two pillars of the Louisville community, whose tragic and senseless deaths we mourn, but we hope it sends the message that the Justice Department will work tirelessly to bring perpetrators of bias-motivated violence to justice,” Karlan said."
social justice,"Asian Americans were already worn down by a year of pandemic-fueled racist attacks when a white gunman was charged with attacking three Atlanta-area massage parlors and killing eight people, most of them Asian women."
social justice,"“Today’s guilty plea will ensure that a violent and disturbed man will never get another chance to target and terrorize the Black community,” Pamela S. Karlan, the principal deputy assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division, said in a statement."
social justice,"Hundreds of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders turned to social media to air their anger, sadness, fear and hopelessness. The hashtag #StopAsianHate was a top trending topic on Twitter hours after the shootings that happened Tuesday evening."
social justice,"“I think the reason why people are feeling so hopeless is because Asian Americans have been ringing the bell on this issue for so long ... We’ve been raising the red flag,” said Aisha Yaqoob Mahmood, executive director of the Atlanta-based Asian American Advocacy Fund, which does political and advocacy work across Georgia."
social justice,"Many were also outraged that the suspect, 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long, was not immediately charged with hate crimes. Authorities said Long told police the attack was not racially motivated, and he claimed that he targeted the spas because of a “sex addiction.” Six of the seven slain women were identified as Asian."
social justice,"Law enforcement needs “some training understanding what a hate crime is. This man identified targets owned by Asians,” said Margaret Huang, president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. The gunman “was very clearly going after a targeted group of people.”"
social justice,"Being Asian American herself, Huang said the shootings felt personal. She is worried that not classifying the attack as a hate crime will “absolutely discourage others from coming forward and seeking help.”"
social justice,"She also cringed at the comments of a sheriff’s captain who said of the gunman, “It was a really bad day for him.”"
social justice,Mahmood said Asian American business owners in the Atlanta area were already fearful because of incidents like graffiti and break-ins. The shootings will raise that worry to new heights.
social justice,"The remark “appeared to be trying to explain and justify” the suspect’s actions. “Hopefully it was a misstatement,” Huang said."
social justice,"“A lot of Asian American business owners in the beauty parlor industry and food service — these are often the most visible front-line faces in the community,” Mahmood said."
social justice,"Her organization is partnering with other groups such as the Atlanta chapter of Asian Americans Advancing Justice to offer resources in multiple languages, including mental health assistance, self-defense training and bystander training."

social justice,"“After the month and year we had, we knew our folks needed the time to come together safely just to grieve and heal and mourn and speak to what’s happening,” said Mohan Seshadri, Asian Pacific Islander Political Alliance co-executive director."
social justice,"As much despair as Asian Americans feel, Seshadri said, the shootings also mark a flashpoint."
social justice,"“Our folks are pissed off and ready to fight,” Seshadri said. “The way we get through this is together by organizing our people and feeling solidarity.”"
social justice,"Numerous Asian American organizations say Trump’s rhetoric has emboldened people to express anti-Asian or anti-immigrant views. Nearly 3,800 incidents have been reported to Stop AAPI Hate, a California-based reporting center for Asian American Pacific Islanders, and its partner groups, since March 2020. Nationally, women reported hate crimes 2.3 times more than men."
social justice,"Arizona Asian Chamber of Commerce CEO Vicente Reid is planning a vigil next week in the Phoenix suburb of Mesa, which has a high concentration of Asian American-owned shops and restaurants. He thinks the slayings have galvanized the local community to go beyond vigils."
social justice,"“I think there is this whole outlet of this younger generation who’s passionate and has the energy. They just need someone to step up and lead them,” Reid said."
social justice,"For the past several weeks, Asian Americans have questioned how to deal with a recent wave of assaults — many on the elderly — that have coincided with the pandemic.

social justice,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Faced with a rising number of migrants at the southwest border and criticism from all sides, the Biden administration’s head of Homeland Security insisted Tuesday that the situation is under control as he defended a policy of allowing teens and children crossing by themselves to remain in the country."
social justice,"“They are vulnerable children and we have ended the prior administration’s practice of expelling them,” Mayorkas said in his most detailed statement yet on a situation at the border that he characterized as “difficult” but not the crisis that critics have portrayed."
social justice,"The increasing number of migrants attempting to cross the border, which is at the highest level since 2019 but is on pace to rise to hit a 20-year peak, has become an early test for President Joe Biden as he seeks to break from his immediate predecessor, President Donald Trump, who waged a broad effort to significantly curtail both legal and illegal immigration."
social justice,"Republicans in Congress have claimed that Biden’s support for immigration legislation and decision to allow people to make legal asylum claims has become a magnet for migrants, but Mayorkas noted that there have been surges in the past, even under Trump."
social justice,"The number of children crossing by themselves rose 60% from January to more than 9,400 in February, the most recent statistics available. The overall increase is blamed on a number of factors, including the economic upheaval caused by the pandemic in Central America and two recent hurricanes in the region. U.S. officials have also conceded that smugglers have likely encouraged people to try to cross under the new administration."
social justice,"Some progressive Democrats and others, meanwhile, have assailed the Biden administration for holding migrant children in U.S. Customs and Border Protection detention facilities longer than the allowed 72 hours as it struggles to find space in shelters run by the Department of Health and Human Services."
social justice,House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy led a delegation of a dozen Republican lawmakers on Monday to the border in Texas and blamed the Biden administration for driving an increase in migrants by actions that include supporting legislation in Congress that would provide a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented people now in the country and halting border wall construction.
social justice,"“The sad part about all of this is it didn’t have to happen. This crisis was created by the presidential policies of this new administration,” McCarthy said."
social justice,"Trump, however, also confronted a similar surge in 2019 even as it rushed to expand the border wall system along the border and forced people seeking asylum to do so in Central America or remain in Mexico. A year earlier he forcibly separated migrant children from their families as part of a zero-tolerance campaign that became one of the most significant political challenges of his administration."
social justice,"After dropping during the start of the pandemic, the number of migrants caught while crossing the border began to rise in April. Some of the increase is due to people who are repeatedly caught after being expelled under the public health order."
social justice,"The total number of people encountered by CBP rose about 28% from January to February to just over 100,000, most of whom were single adults. The last time the number was that high was in June 2019."
social justice,"It has enlisted the Federal Emergency Management Agency to set up new temporary facilities to house migrant children in Texas and Arizona. It is also working with HHS to expand shelter capacity and backing aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador to try to stem the flow of migrants at the source."
social justice,"“The situation we are currently facing at the southwest border is a difficult one,” Mayorkas said. “We are tackling it.”"
social justice,"President Joe Biden’s administration is struggling to deal with an increase in migrants attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border and Republicans who insist it’s all Democrats’ fault, further complicating an already murky path for overhauling the country’s immigration system. "
social justice,"Migrants who are under 18 years old are being allowed to remain in the country while the government decides whether they have a legal claim to residency, either under asylum law or for some other reason."
social justice,"Mayorkas noted that 80% of the children, most of whom are from the three Northern Triangle countries of Central America, have a relative in the U.S. and 40% have a parent."
social justice,"On Thursday, the House passed legislation giving a pathway to citizenship to the young undocumented migrants known as “Dreamers” and to 400,000 immigrants living with temporary protected status, as well as a separate piece of legislation granting legal status ― but not citizenship ― to millions of undocumented farmworkers. "
social justice,"Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas conceded that a surge in the number of children, mostly from Central America, is a challenge for the Border Patrol and other agencies amid the coronavirus pandemic. But he rejected a Trump-era policy of sending them immediately back to Mexico or other countries."
social justice,The Biden administration last week ended a Trump administration policy that made relatives reluctant to contact HHS to retrieve children for fear of being deported themselves.
social justice,"Mayorkas took swipes at the previous administration for dismantling an asylum system that would have enabled a more “orderly” immigration system, cutting aid to Central America and failing to vaccinate Border Patrol agents."
social justice,The U.S. is continuing to expel most single adults and families either to Mexico or to their countries of origin. Mayorkas said exceptions are being made for adults with “certain acute vulnerabilities” that he did not specify or for families when Mexican authorities don’t have capacity in shelters to accept them.
social justice,"But making either of those bills a legal reality ― never mind potentially crafting a large-scale deal with the GOP to grant legalization to millions of other undocumented immigrants ― looks increasingly difficult. Democratic aides, legislators and operatives are divided on what path to take, and most Republicans are more interested in turning the border crisis into a winning political issue than in seeking out compromise."
social justice,"“They are sending the message that anyone who makes the dangerous journey to cross the border will be rewarded,” McCarthy said in a speech on the House floor on Thursday, later accusing Democrats of “wasting time on a bill that could not be less timely or targeted to the issue at hand.”"
social justice,"Biden administration officials have dismissed that argument, instead pointing to the devastation wreaked by two hurricanes that struck Central America this year and noting that 2019 was a record year for migration despite Trump “ripp[ing] over 3,000 children from their parents’ arms,” a senior Biden administration official told reporters. "
social justice,"Republicans, led by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), have blamed Biden’s promises for a more humane immigration system and his administration’s move to end harsh policies targeting asylum-seekers for drawing migrants to the border in larger numbers. "
social justice,"“While the situation at the border does need its proper attention and response, let’s not get distracted here,” said California Sen. Alex Padilla, who has pushed other Democrats to pass immigration legislation since taking office earlier this year. “I think this underscores the urgency for a long-overdue change in immigration policy.” "
social justice,The situation at the border is clearly pulling focus from broader reform efforts. Biden administration officials held a conference call with reporters on Thursday not to discuss the path forward for legislation ― but to address their efforts to deal with a surge of migrants that began under Donald Trump’s presidency.
social justice,"U.S. officials encountered migrants crossing the border with Mexico more than 100,000 times in February, the first time since 2019 that migration was that high, and families and unaccompanied children made up 29% of that mix ― a sharp increase since the end of Trump’s presidency."
social justice,"After the relatively smooth passage of the popular $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan for coronavirus relief, this past week’s actions on immigration show how Biden and Democrats could struggle to make large parts of their agenda a reality as fresh crises appear and their razor-thin congressional majorities fail to overcome a united Republican party. "
social justice,"There are now more than 14,000 migrant children in federal custody, and the Department of Health and Human Services ― which is responsible for caring for child migrants apprehended without their parents ― is struggling to find adequate shelters amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Administration officials said on the conference call it could take months to find them acceptable accommodations."
social justice,"“Deterrence and language alone are not sole factors of migration decisions,” the official continued."
social justice,"“There are many Republicans who don’t want us to fix this broken immigration system,” Castro said on a conference call while reiterating that he hoped many immigration measures could earn bipartisan support. “They’re going to their biggest red meat issue. This was Trump’s play all the time, over and over and over again.” "
social justice,"Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julián Castro, who ran for president on one of the most liberal immigration plans in decades, told reporters that Republicans were using the border crisis to derail the push for immigration reform and to distract from the Biden administration’s popular COVID-19 relief package. "
social justice,"Still, there appears to be some effort from the Biden administration to tell migrants to stay away. Biden himself delivered a message in an interview with ABC News. “I can say quite clearly: Don’t come over,” he said, reiterating that most adults and family are being sent back across the border or to their home countries. "
social justice,Republican operatives say their internal polling points to immigration as a potential weakness for Biden and Democrats ahead of the ’22 midterm elections. A Pew Research Center survey released earlier this month found 53% of Americans had confidence in Biden’s decision on immigration policy ― lower than 65% of Americans who had confidence in his ability to fight the coronavirus or the 56% who had confidence in his handling of the economy. 
social justice,"Republicans are largely unified in their opposition to broader immigration reform, with four years of defending Trump’s hard-line policies under their belts. The GOP, which faces internal splits over how to deal with Trump, national security and economics, sees relatively little dissent on immigration issues. "
social justice,"“The Biden administration is creating chaos where there was order,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of the Republicans who led negotiations during the last major attempt to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill, said during a press conference on Wednesday. “The only way we’ll be able to sit down with our Democratic colleagues is for us to regain control of the border.”"
social justice,"But there are divisions among Democrats on how to move forward on immigration. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, a member of Democratic leadership, told reporters earlier this week he did not think there were votes to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill this Congress."
social justice,"While Democrats were united on both bills that passed Thursday, two Latino members of Congress from South Texas ― Reps. Henry Cueller and Vicente González ― had warned of the pending migrant surge. Other moderate Democrats, like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, have not been shy about calling the situation a “crisis” ― a term White House officials have made a point of avoiding. "
social justice,"The Biden administration sought to make a big splash on immigration, releasing a comprehensive bill ― although one without the improvements to border security Republicans would like to see ― on his first day in office. "

environment,"This year’s Gulf of Mexico “dead zone” — an area where there’s too little oxygen to support marine life — is larger than average, according to researchers."
environment,"Scientists supported by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration determined that the area off Louisiana and Texas’ coasts covers about 6,334 square miles (16,405 square kilometers), the agency said in a news release Tuesday."
environment,"Over the past five years, the average size of the low-oxygen, or hypoxic, zone has been 5,380 square miles (13,934 square kilometers). That’s 2.8 times larger than the goal set by a federal task force to reduce the five-year average to 1,900 square miles (4,921 square kilometers) or smaller by 2035."
environment,This summer’s measurement was larger than the average-sized area that the agency predicted in June based on Mississippi River nitrogen and phosphorous runoff data.
environment,Because year-to-year measurements can vary widely — this year’s zone is about three times the size of 2020’s — NOAA says a multiyear average “captures the true dynamic nature of the zone.”
environment,River discharge that drained into the Gulf of Mexico was above normal for the three weeks before the weeklong survey started on July 25. It was conducted by scientists from Louisiana State University and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium.
environment,"“The distribution of the low dissolved oxygen was unusual this summer,” Nancy Rabalais, the lead investigator, said. “The low oxygen conditions were very close to shore with many observations showing an almost complete lack of oxygen.”"
environment,"
Human activities in urban and agricultural areas throughout the Mississippi River watershed primarily cause the annual “dead zone.” Excess nutrients flow into the Gulf of Mexico and stimulate an overgrowth of algae, which die and decompose. The algae deplete oxygen as they sink to the bottom.
"
environment,"NOAA highlighted efforts to reduce fertilizer runoff and other pollution from contributing to the hypoxic area. Radhika Fox, the Environmental Protection Agency’s assistant administrator for water, said climate change also needs to be considered to make progress."
environment,"“This year, we have seen again and again the profound effect that climate change has on our communities — from historic drought in the west to flooding events,” Fox said. “Climate is directly linked to water, including the flow of nutrient pollution into the Gulf of Mexico.”"

environment,"The COVID-19 pandemic has allowed humpback whales in Alaskan waters to experience a quieter environment than usual, and there has been a marked difference in their behavior."
environment,"The cruise ships that play a big role Alaska’s tourism industry generate loud noises underwater that interfere with the activity of marine mammals. With cruises largely being a no-go during the pandemic, overall marine traffic in the state’s Glacier Bay dropped by about 40%, the BBC reported in a comprehensive piece about the whales in southern Alaska."
environment,"Humpback whales previously stuck close by each other and communicated in less complex ways, similar to people in a loud bar, National Park Service wildlife biologist Christine Gabriele told the BBC. But with fewer ships, whales spread out across greater distances and their whale songs became more varied. Mothers were observed giving their calves more freedom and even sometimes taking naps, she said."
environment,"“Whales use sound in almost every aspect of their daily life,” she said."
environment,"“More needs to be done,” Jason Gedamke of NOAA fisheries’ ocean acoustics program told NPR. “When you have animals that for millions of years have been able to communicate over vast distances in the ocean, and then once we introduce noise and have increased sound levels and they can’t communicate over those distances, clearly there’s going to be some impact there.”"
environment,"The first large cruise ship in 21 months ― a test voyage aimed at gauging how well COVID-19 precautions would work ― returned to Alaska last month, according to the Anchorage Daily News."
environment,Scientists hoped that finding out more about how underwater sound affects whales would be helpful in crafting conservation policy.

environment,Weber reported from Los Angeles. Associated Press writers Stefanie Dazio in Los Angeles and Janie Har and Jocelyn Gecker in San Francisco contributed to this report.
environment,"This natural redistribution of heat has long worked to stabilize regional climate and weather conditions; however, scientists have been warning that the system is slowing down. A 2019 United Nations report concluded that while the current is “very likely” to weaken this century, a total breakdown was unlikely. "
environment,"The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC, a section of the Gulf Stream, transports warm water from the tropics northward and cold water from the North Atlantic to the south."
environment,"But the new study, published Thursday in the journal Nature Climate Change, indicates the situation could be far direr than previously thought. The current changes may be tied to “an almost complete loss of stability of the AMOC over the course of the last century,” the analysis states. "
environment,"“The findings support the assessment that the AMOC decline is not just a fluctuation or a linear response to increasing temperatures but likely means the approaching of a critical threshold beyond which the circulation system could collapse,” Niklas Boers, a researcher at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany and the study’s author, said in a statement. "
environment,"A crippled Atlantic current system could trigger catastrophic, potentially irreversible changes, from rising seas in North America to major disruptions to seasonal monsoon rains in Asia and South America. "
environment,"“The mere possibility that the AMOC tipping point is close should be motivation enough for us to take countermeasures,” Levke Caesar, a climate physicist at Ireland’s Maynooth University, told The Washington Post. “The consequences of a collapse would likely be far-reaching.”"
environment,"But Andreas Schmittner, a climate scientist at Oregon State University, is skeptical of the study’s conclusion. "
environment,"“The method used in the paper has been developed and tested in very simple models of dynamical systems, but then it is applied to observations of sea surface temperatures and salinities,” he told HuffPost in an email. “I think their method is brand new and needs to be tested by different investigators and explored more in complex climate models to see if it works with the data they used. I think it is premature to conclude that the AMOC is on the brink of collapse.”"
environment,"The study comes ahead of a major report from the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, the leading consortium of researchers studying human-caused temperature rise. The assessment, due out Aug. 9 and authored by more than 200 scientists, will provide an up-to-date understanding of the crisis and its current and future effects around the globe."
environment,"There’s no way to pinpoint the level of greenhouse gas emissions that would lock in a total collapse of the AMOC, Boers told The Guardian. “The only thing to do,” he said, “is keep emissions as low as possible. The likelihood of this extremely high-impact event happening increases with every gram of CO2 that we put into the atmosphere.”"
environment,"Just months after Wisconsin hunters killed nearly twice as many wolves as the state allowed, wiping out a third of the entire population, the state proposes the killing of 130 more wolves this fall."
environment,State Department of Natural Resources officials believe culling an additional 130 wolves is a “conservative” approach. The department’s board will consider the recommendation next week.
environment,"Hunters killed 218 wolves in February, 82% more than the quota the state set after wolves were removed from the endangered species list by the Trump administration. The wolves were killed during breeding season (wolves mate for life) by hunters allowed to use dogs, traps and snowmobiles."
environment,The Center for Biological Diversity called the February hunt a “reckless slaughter.” 
environment,"Adrian Wydeven, a retired state wolf biologist and a member of the conservation group Wisconsin’s Green Fire, said the 130 number is “too high, given the unknowns” of the impact from February’s hunt. Neither Michigan nor Minnesota, which also have wolf populations, will allow hunts this year."
environment,University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers warned in a new study that Wisconsin’s plans for another hunt “raise questions about sustainability.”
environment,"A third of the state’s wolves were killed during February’s hunt and in poaching that followed, according to the researchers. That leaves the Wisconsin’s total wolf population at 695 to 751."
environment,"The population decline appears to contradict the state Department of Natural Resources’ “explicit objectives of no change in the wolf population,” the study noted."
environment,"The state’s stated goal is maintaining a stable population of wolves, a top predator that helps sustain ecosystem health, study co-author and Madison environmental studies professor Adrian Treves told The National Geographic."
environment,"In addition, the study warned that February’s killing of more wolves than allowed “raises serious questions about the adequacy of regulatory mechanisms to prevent wolves becoming endangered again.”"
environment,"Treves called plans for a November hunt unwise, particularly since officials have no clear understanding of the impact of the February killings. Hunters often seek out the largest animals, for example, which are frequently pack leaders whose loss could leave entire groups to starve to death. The killing of fertile females would further reduce the population."
environment,"“We caution that science may play little role in wolf politics where the animal has become a symbol for political rhetoric and a symbol of cultural divisions,” the study added."

environment,"“Here we are seeing a process of long-term decrease in precipitation, a mega-drought,” Ricardo Villalba of the Argentine Institute of Snow, Glacier and Environment Science Studies told Reuters. “If you look at the precipitation levels right now for the entire Cordillera [Andes range], they ​​show that it has either not snowed at all or has snowed very little.”"
environment,"Because it’s winter in the Southern Hemisphere, the mountain range should be seeing peak snowfall. Scientists attribute the decade-long drought to human-caused climate change."
environment,A study published in June predicted that droughts and other extreme weather events will become even worse throughout South America if greenhouse gas emissions continue unchecked.
environment,"“South America and Brazil in particular are already showing signs of climate change, including a rise in surface temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, melting of glaciers in the Andes, and more frequent and intense extreme weather events,” Lincoln Muniz Alves, a researcher at Brazil’s National Space Research Institute, said in a news release. “These variations in the characteristics of the climate are forerunners of what will happen in the decades ahead if the unprecedented rise in greenhouse gas emissions continues.”"

environment,"U.S. officials are seeking to list emperor penguins as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act due to climate change, with the request coming as an independent study warns that nearly all of the seabird’s colonies could be nearly wiped out by 2100."
environment,"Melting sea ice is primarily jeopardizing the emperor penguin’s ability to form breeding colonies, forage for food and avoid predators due to their habitat’s destruction along Antarctica’s coastline, officials said."
environment,"“Climate change, a priority challenge for this Administration, impacts a variety of species throughout the world,” Martha Williams, principal deputy director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services, said in a statement. “The decisions made by policymakers today and during the next few decades will determine the fate of the emperor penguin.”"
environment,"“As carbon dioxide emissions rise, the Earth’s temperature will continue to increase, causing large patches of sea ice to melt. The melting ice could affect a variety of species, including emperor penguins, who rely on sea ice for survival,” the FWS said in release."
environment,"The federal agency estimates that though the penguins’ populations are currently robust, their global size will likely decrease by 26 to 47% by 2050. That’s under low and high carbon emissions scenarios, respectively."
environment,"This puts them “in danger of extinction in the foreseeable future in a significant portion of its range,” the FWS said."
environment,"Another study published Tuesday in the journal Global Change Biology painted a more dire picture, however, with it concluding that around 70% of emperor penguin colonies will be endangered by 2050. By 2100, 98% could be on the brink of extinction, the study found."
environment,"The U.S. officially left the Paris Agreement in late 2020 under the leadership of then President Donald Trump. President Joe Biden signed an executive order to rejoin it immediately after taking office in January. By joining the pact, nations agree to limit their greenhouse gas emissions to help prevent global warming."
environment,"This study’s findings were considered by the FWS with its proposal on Tuesday, The New York Times reported."
environment,"The study determined that rapid cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, specifically limiting warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit under the international Paris Agreement, would be “by far the most important action for preventing catastrophic species losses.” Protecting natural habitat, increasing habitat connectivity and reducing non-climate stressors would also increase the species’ resilience to climate stress."
environment,"The FWS said that not all emperor penguin colonies are expected to be affected equally by climate change, with populations in the Ross and Weddell Seas likely to remain stable for the species during its projected timeline. Other colonies ― specifically the Indian Ocean, Western Pacific Ocean, Bellingshausen Sea and Amundsen Sea sectors ― are meanwhile projected to decline by over 90% due to melting sea."
environment,"Though this estimated decline is concerning, the FWS said “there is still time to prevent the species from becoming endangered throughout a significant portion of its range.”"
environment,"Listing emperor penguins under the Endangered Species Act would make it unlawful to harass, harm, or capture the animal without a permit. It would also be illegal to significantly modify or degrade its habitat in ways that kill or injure the animal, including by impairing its essential behavior patterns, such as breeding, feeding or sheltering."
environment,"Though the species is not found within the U.S., this new threatened status could have an impact on fishing regulations. Environmentalists hope it will impact fossil fuel use as well, as the Times reported."
environment,"“The hope is that, with these added protections, approvals of U.S. fossil fuel projects will have to weigh harms to penguins and their Antarctic habitat, ultimately reducing heat-trapping pollution worldwide,” Sarah Uhlemann, international program director at the Center for Biological Diversity, told the Times."
environment,A 60-day public comment period now follows the FWS’s recommendation.

environment,"“As one of the agencies charged with the responsibility to protect and manage America’s wild horses and burros, the BLM is prepared to take emergency action where we can in order to save the lives of these cherished animals,” said Nada Wolff Culver, the bureau’s deputy director for policy and programs."
environment,"The agency is committed to “continuing our efforts to reduce overpopulation across the West and achieve healthy, sustainable herd sizes that are more capable of withstanding severe conditions, including prolonged drought, which are becoming more frequent due to climate change,” she said in announcing the effort Monday."
environment,Horse advocates say the emergency roundups that will continue into September are being driven by pressure from ranchers who don’t want the mustangs competing with their livestock for limited forage and water.
environment,One advocate said she’s especially disappointed the Biden administration is continuing the policies of former President Donald Trump and previous administrations that prioritized removal of horses that are federally protected without reining in the number of cattle and sheep grazing on the same land.
environment,"“Profit-driven interests ravage the landscape, and we blame the horse,” said Laura Leigh, president of the nonprofit group Wild Horse Education."
environment,"“Absolutely nothing has changed under the Biden administration except we are being spoon-fed a dose of greenwash that they ‘care’ about the environment and wild things,” she said."
environment,"The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association said ranchers already have made voluntary changes to reduce and rotate grazing on federal lands during a drought “more pervasive and dramatic than we have seen in years,” said Kaitlynn Glover, the association’s executive director of resources."
environment,"The bureau already has gathered 1,200 animals this year and originally intended to round up about 12,000. The new effort would push the total to about 18,000 across 10 Western states from Montana to California."
environment,"“These removals are critical for the horses as well as the health of the rangelands,” she said in an email to The Associated Press. “Even in times where resources are plentiful, these overpopulated herds cause serious damage to the landscape.”"
environment,"The bureau says the estimated 86,000 free-roaming mustangs and burros on federal lands is three times what the ecosystem can sustain, something that animal advocates dispute."
environment,"About 1,400 that are rounded up would be returned to the range after they receive contraceptive drugs. But the total rounded up would be more than double the 9,181 gathered last year."
environment,"The previous peak over the past decade was 9,749 in 2018. Fewer than 4,100 were gathered annually from 2013 through 2017."
environment,Culver noted that the land agency announced last week that it was taking additional steps to ensure that captured horses made available for public adoption do not end up in the hands of secondhand buyers who ship them to slaughterhouses.
environment,"That move drew mixed reactions from horse advocates, who welcomed efforts to tighten regulations but said the reforms don’t go far enough and that horses will still end up being slaughtered as long as the government offers $1,000 cash incentives to adopt the animals."
environment,"Neda DeMayo, president of Return to Freedom Wild Horse Conservation, said the crisis on the range is the result of the Bureau of Land Management’s “failure to implement solutions that have been available for over 20 years,” including accelerated use of fertility control programs."
environment,"U.S. Rep. Dina Titus, a Nevada Democrat, agreed."
environment,"“This situation further illustrates that the status quo does not work,” Titus said. “That is why I led an effort to provide funding in this year’s Interior appropriations bill for safe and humane birth control.”"
environment,The U.S. on Monday finally reached President Joe Biden’s goal of getting at least one COVID-19 shot in the arms of 70% of American adults ― a month late and amid a fierce surge by the delta variant that is swamping hospitals and leading to new mask rules and mandatory vaccinations around the country.
environment,"“As fast as we are opening up units, they’re being filled with COVID patients,” lamented Dr. Sergio Segarra, chief medical officer of Baptist Hospital Miami, where the Florida chain reported an increase of well over 140% in the past two weeks in the number of people now hospitalized with the virus. “As quickly as we can discharge them they’re coming in and they’re coming in very sick. We started seeing entire families come down.”"
environment,"Louisiana ordered nearly everyone, vaccinated or not, to wear masks again in all indoor public settings, including schools and colleges, and other cities and states likewise moved to reinstate precautions to counter a crisis blamed on the fast-spreading variant and stubborn resistance to getting the vaccine."
environment,Biden had set a goal of reaching the 70% threshold by the Fourth of July. But that target was set well before the highly contagious delta variant enabled the virus to come storming back and undermined the assumptions that were used to arrive at that figure.
environment,"There was was no celebration at the White House on Monday, nor a setting of a new target, as the administration instead struggles to overcome public resistance."
environment,The 70% target marked the low-end of initial government estimates for what would be necessary to achieve herd immunity in the U.S. That has been rendered insufficient by the delta variant.
environment,The U.S. still has not hit the administration’s other goal of fully vaccinating 165 million American adults by July 4. It is about 8.5 million short.
environment,"New cases per day in the U.S. have increased sixfold over the past month to an average of nearly 80,000, a level not seen since mid-February. And deaths per day have climbed over the past two weeks from an average of 259 to 360. Those are still well below the 3,400 deaths and a quarter-million cases per day seen during the worst of the outbreak, in January."
environment,Some places around the country are seeing newly confirmed infections and hospital caseloads reach their highest levels since the pandemic began a year and a half ago. Nearly all deaths and serious illnesses now are in unvaccinated people.
environment,"The surge has led states and cities across the U.S. to beat a retreat, just weeks after it looked as if the country was going to see a close-to-normal summer."
environment,Health officials in San Francisco and six other Bay Area counties announced Monday they are reinstating a requirement that everyone — vaccinated or not — wear masks in public indoor spaces.
environment,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said New York City airport and transit workers will have to get vaccinated or face weekly testing. He stopped short of mandating either masks or inoculations for the general public, saying he lacks legal authority to do so."
environment,"Denver’s mayor said said the city will require police officers, firefighters and certain other municipal employees to get vaccinated, along with workers at schools, nursing homes, hospitals and jails."
environment,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that a nationwide vaccination requirement “is not on the table,” but noted that employers have the right to take that step as they see fit."
environment,"Minnesota’s public colleges and universities will require masks while indoors on campus, regardless of vaccination status. And New Jersey said workers at state-run nursing homes, psychiatric hospitals and other such institutions must get the shot or face regular testing."
environment,"In Florida, it took two months last summer for the number of people in the hospital with the coronavirus to jump from 2,000 to 10,000. It took only 27 days this summer for Florida hospitals to see that same increase, said Florida Hospital Association President Mary Mayhew."
environment,"She noted also that this time, 96% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients are unvaccinated and are far younger, many of them in their 20s and 30s."
environment,"While setting a national vaccination goal may have been useful for trying to drum up enthusiasm for the shots, 70% of Americans getting one shot was never going to be enough to prevent surges among unvaccinated groups. And when he announced the goal, Biden acknowledged it was just a first step."
environment,"It’s the level of vaccinations in a community — not a broad national average — that can slow an outbreak or allow it to flourish. Vaccination rates from region to region differ wildly, and some places are far more vulnerable than others."
environment,Vaccination rates in some Southern states are far lower than they are New England. Vermont has fully inoculated nearly 78% of its adult population. Alabama has just cracked 43%.

environment,"There’s a heightened chance that this year’s Atlantic hurricane season will be above average with more named storms and hurricanes than previously predicted, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Wednesday."
environment,"The latest outlook for the six-month season, which began June 1 and ends Nov. 30, includes 15 to 21 named storms, seven to 10 hurricanes, and three to five major hurricanes reaching a category of 3, 4 or 5, NOAA said."
environment,"So far this year, there have been five named storms, one of which became a hurricane and was the earliest fifth-named storm on record. These past storms are included in the total number of storms forecast for the season."
environment,"“After a record-setting start, the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season does not show any signs of relenting as it enters the peak months ahead,” said Rick Spinrad, NOAA administrator."
environment,"NOAA’s latest forecast is a slight jump from the previous forecast it made in late May, when it predicted 13 to 20 named storms and six to 10 hurricanes. The number of major hurricanes predicted has not changed."
environment,"Overall, the likelihood of an above-normal 2021 season is now 65% ― up from a 60% projection in May. If the prediction is accurate, 2021 would be the sixth consecutive year to feature above-average storm activity in the Atlantic."
environment,"“Now is the time to be vigilant about your preparedness plans and potential actions,” Matthew Rosencrans, lead seasonal hurricane forecaster at NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said at a news conference. “As we have seen in recent years, threats from hurricanes are not limited to damaging winds but also dangerous storm surge and torrential rain and wind flooding.”"
environment,"NOAA last month also issued a La Niña Watch, with a 55% chance of it emerging during the September-November period and lasting through winter."
environment,"Fortunately, due to sea surface temperatures being closer to average across the Atlantic region where storms typically develop, this year is not expected to be as active as last year, said Rosencrans."
environment,"This climate pattern tends to lead to drought in the southern U.S. and heavy rains and flooding in the Pacific Northwest and Canada. While it tends to suppress hurricane activity along the Pacific, it can lead to more and strongerAtlantic storms, particularly in the latter half of the year, according to NOAA."
environment,"The chance of La Niña was factored into NOAA’s hurricane outlook for this year, said Rosencrans."
environment,NOAA’s upgraded forecast comes as the National Hurricane Center monitors two disturbances brewing in the Atlantic. One of the disturbances is said to have the potential to turn into a tropical depression by early next week.
environment,President Joe Biden has repeatedly bragged that the bipartisan infrastructure bill germinating in the U.S. Senate will spur the removal of America’s toxic drinking water pipes made of lead.
environment,"“It will put plumbers and pipe fitters to work replacing all of the nation’s lead water pipes, so every child and every American can turn on the faucet at home or school and drink clean water,” Biden said last week, “including in low-income communities and communities of color that have been disproportionally affected by dangerous lead pipes.”"
environment,"But the bill does not require water utilities to replace lead pipes. Rather, it provides $15 billion to a revolving fund that utilities can use to replace lead pipes if they want ― something that’s only happened in a handful of cities to date."
environment,"“Unless the utilities are required to do it, we’re concerned that a lot of utilities won’t,” Erik Olson, a water policy expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council, told HuffPost."
environment,"Replacing a single service line can cost thousands of dollars, because it typically requires digging up the ground in front of the building to get at the pipe. Water utilities have insisted they’re not responsible for the portions of pipe that lie within someone’s property line, making removal a huge collective action problem."
environment,"Biden originally proposed $45 billion for removing lead pipes as part of what the White House called the American Jobs Plan, an early outline of the infrastructure bill. That sum reflected the expert consensus about how much it would cost to remove the roughly 10 million lead service lines connecting water mains to buildings around the country."
environment,"The infrastructure bill, as drafted, would plow just $15 billion earmarked for pipe replacement into the Environmental Protection Agency’s Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. The bill would not amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to require utilities to replace the pipes."
environment,"“Is it going to be enough to deal with every lead pipe in the country? Probably not, but we’ll make great progress,” Sen. Tom Carper (D-Del.), who chairs the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, told HuffPost."
environment,"But $15 billion is probably not enough to get all the pipes. The Natural Resources Defense Council has estimated there are somewhere between 9.7 million and 12.8 million lead service lines in the 50 states, and the EPA puts the average pipe replacement cost at $4,700 ― meaning $45 billion would be almost enough to get them all."
environment,"Fifteen billion dollars is certainly more than Congress has ever allocated for lead pipe removal. Lawmakers in 2016 allocated $100 million for lead pipe replacement in Flint, Michigan, after the city suffered an egregious spike in water lead ― which state and federal officials initially dismissed, even though the city’s corroded lead pipes were spewing brown water into Flint homes."
environment,"Biden, however, has said almost every day that the bill will get the whole job done with $15 billion."
environment,"“It’s going to eliminate all lead pipes in America, so people have decent drinking water,” Biden said Monday during a Democratic fundraiser. A White House fact sheet on Tuesday said the bill will replace “all of the nation’s lead pipes.”"
environment,"The White House insisted to HuffPost on Tuesday that even with less money than Biden himself originally proposed, the bill will eradicate lead pipes from the U.S. "
environment,"“The bipartisan agreement will eliminate all lead drinking water pipes and service lines in the United States with this unprecedented funding ― full stop,” spokesman Andrew Bates said, noting that the bill would give states an additional $11 billion for general drinking water funding that they could put toward lead pipe replacement. "
environment,"Lead is a deadly neurotoxin, and drinking water that’s flowed through lead pipes can lower young children’s IQs and increase the risk of pregnant women suffering miscarriages. Lead has been known to be unhealthy since Roman times, but it’s a soft metal that’s good for making pipes, and in the 20th century the lead industry encouraged cities to use it for water lines."
environment,"The Safe Drinking Water Act requires utilities to test water samples from people’s homes and treat the water to make it less corrosive to lead pipes. Utilities only have to replace the pipes if the home water samples show excessive amounts of lead, creating a strong incentive for them to avoid testing in homes known to have lead service lines."
environment,"Under Biden, the EPA suspended the Trump administration’s pending revision to its drinking water lead regulation, which has been in limbo for years."
environment,"“These lead lines will last forever unless you take ’em out,” Harold Harrington, a master plumber in Flint, Michigan, said Tuesday during a conference call with the United Association of Union Plumbers and Pipefitters and the green business group E2."
environment,"“Fifteen billion will not get the job done,” E2 executive director Bob Keefe said."
environment,"The groups called attention to an economic impact analysis of Biden’s original lead pipe proposal, which found that it would create and support 56,080 good-paying jobs annually for a decade. The proposal in the bipartisan infrastructure bill would do less."
environment,"Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.Y.) ― the former mayor of Newark, New Jersey, one of the few U.S. cities to replace all its lead service lines ― said the Senate is squandering its opportunity to replace pipes nationwide."
environment,"“This is the moment for America to do it,” Booker told HuffPost. “It actually saves us money in the long run, because children with lead poisoning are far less productive and have far higher medical costs.”"
environment,Booker lamented “the moral obscenity of having our best talent poisoned” in such a preventable way.
environment,"“The heads of agencies shall identify for the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the National Climate Advisor any fossil fuel subsidies provided by their respective agencies, and then take steps to ensure that, to the extent consistent with applicable law, Federal funding is not directly subsidizing fossil fuels,” the order reads. "
environment,"“I live in a community that’s seen and ravages of lead poisoning for decades now with lead paint, lead water,” he said. “We have a moral obligation to do this.”"
environment,"One week after being sworn in, President Joe Biden signed a sweeping executive order aimed at “tackling the climate crisis at home and abroad.” It included seemingly clear language about ending subsidies for the industry most responsible for planetary warming."
environment,"The order also directed the secretary of the interior to “consider whether to adjust royalties associated with coal, oil, and gas resources extracted from public lands and offshore waters, or take other appropriate action, to account for corresponding climate costs.”"
environment,"Squillace noted that Arch reported a net income of $27.9 million in the second quarter of this year, when the cuts were approved."
environment,"“They clearly do not need this relief,” he said."
environment,"At the open-pit Coal Creek mine, which Arch is planning to shut down in fall 2022, the administration agreed to lower the royalty rate from 12.5% to 2% for two years, according to E&E News. At West Elk, an underground mine, the rate dropped from 12.5% to 5% for three years."
environment,The administration has promised aggressive action to rein in planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions. Its explanation of the Arch royalty cuts is as perplexing as the decision itself. 
environment,"Yet Biden’s Interior Department did just that, quietly approving Arch Resource’s request for royalty relief at two of its coal mines, West Elk in Colorado and Coal Creek in Wyoming, as E&E News first reported last week."
environment,No one anticipated that would mean reducing the fees drilling and mining companies pay to extract fossil fuels from federal lands.
environment,"The St. Louis, Missouri-based company made its request for relief last year when the Trump administration was in office, and the Bureau of Land Management approved it in May. Arch Resources, formerly Arch Coal, is the second largest coal supplier in the country. It is also a former client of Interior Deputy Secretary Tommy Beaudreau, though the rate reduction was approved before Beaudreau’s confirmation. "
environment,"“A royalty reduction like this is essentially a subsidy,” he said. “Somebody’s asleep at the switch here.”"
environment,"“The royalty relief process allows the BLM to provide temporary relief for mines to determine if they may remain viable,” a spokesperson for Interior’s Bureau of Land Management told HuffPost by email. The breaks for Arch mines allow “for time to see if potential technological advances, such as methane capture, will work,” the spokesperson said. “Additionally, the reduced rate allows for the recovery of ore that would not otherwise be economic, and thus encourages the greatest ultimate recovery.”"
environment,"Mark Squillace, a professor of natural resources law at the University of Colorado Boulder, called the approval “outrageous” and said he’d like to believe it was some kind of mistake. "
environment,"Biden has come under fire from some of the same climate and environmental groups that largely applauded his early efforts. His administration has worked to uphold a number of Trump-era energy projects, including the previous administration’s decision to approve ConocoPhillips’ massive Willow Project in Alaska’s National Petroleum Reserve last year. The $6 billion project, which is slated to produce 590 million barrels of oil over 30 years, has been a major priority of Alaska’s Republican delegation. "
environment,A horrifying attack by a swarm of bees in an Arizona neighborhood killed a man and injured a number of other people.
environment,"On the campaign trail, Biden vowed to “transition away from the oil industry.” And the Interior Department is in the process of reviewing the federal oil and gas leasing program. Yet permits to drill for oil and gas on public lands have increased under Biden’s watch."
environment,"In a March letter, the Sierra Club and several other environmental groups urged the director of BLM’s Colorado office to deny Arch’s request for royalty relief at the West Elk mine."
environment,"The Interior Department has no obligation to grant companies’ requests for royalty relief. As for promoting the “greatest economic recovery,” Squillace noted that “this argument could be used to justify eliminating royalty payments entirely.”"
environment,Arch Resources did not respond to a request for comment. 
environment,"BLM did not respond to several of HuffPost’s specific questions, including how the decision squares with the administration’s climate goals. The White House, which this week told The New York Times that the administration “has been very clear about marshaling an all-of-government approach that makes climate change a critical piece of our domestic, national security and foreign policy,” did not answer questions and referred HuffPost to the Interior Department."
environment,"“Subsidizing coal mines through ongoing royalty relief directly contributes to the climate crisis, contradicting this administration’s policy,” the organizations wrote at the time. "
environment,"At least six area residents were stung “multiple times“ in the attack Thursday in the Tucson suburb of Marana, according to fire officials."
environment,“How is this reduction going to impact state and federal revenues and how does this decision impact the Administration’s climate policies?” he asked. “Just as the Secretary has the discretion to reduce royalties she has the discretion to refuse to reduce these royalties and I have little doubt that denying this request would have been a better decision both from the perspective of economics and the environment.”
environment,"Three victims, believed to have been stung “hundreds of times,” were transported for medical evaluation. One of them, a man who was not identified by authorities, later died. "
environment,Three firefighters responding to the emergency were also stung several times.
environment,"A large bee hive, weighing about 100 pounds, was located in a tree in the neighborhood and removed."
environment,"“Bee handlers have killed most of the bees and have removed the hive,” according to a statement from the Marana Police Department. “Although the area is much safer, there are still some lingering bees. Please continue to use caution while in the area.”"
environment,"Most Arizona swarms involve Africanized honey bees, a cross between African and European bees, but they are not “killer bees,” according to the Carl Hayden Bee Research Center in Tucson."
environment,"“Africanized honey bees do not fly out in angry swarms to randomly attack unlucky victims,” according to the center."
environment,"A good “safety precaution” is to stay the “width of a four-lane highway” from any African honey bee hive, the center advises. "
environment,"Just days before the Arizona attack, two dogs were killed in a backyard in Los Angeles by an angry swarm of “thousands” of bees, said the homeowner, who was stung multiple times as he tried to save the animals."
environment,"Swarms of bees, which are leaving their parent colony to start a new hive, are “generally docile regardless of type” because they have nothing to protect, the center noted. But the bees can become “highly defensive” when protecting their hives."
environment,"From 2000 through 2017, an average of 62 people died each year from bee, wasp and hornet stings, according to a 2019 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
environment,"As the country’s largest wildfire so far this year burns across Oregon, the state’s Gov. Kate Brown (D) signed a bill Friday that invests another $220 million in the wildfire prevention, preparedness and response needed for “fires of this new age,” she said. "
environment,"As Brown signed the bill, the Bootleg fire in southern Oregon had burned more than 413,000 acres and threatened to grow even bigger in the coming days. It’s just one of many large blazes to have spread across the drought-stricken state this year."
environment,"The $220 million investment builds on an effort Brown started in 2019 when she launched the Wildfire Council to investigate the challenges and solutions to the state’s growing wildfire problem. But the 2019 legislative session ended before lawmakers could pass any of the council’s recommendations for improving wildfire response, fire adaptability in communities and resiliency in Oregon’s landscapes. The bill investing in and implementing those strategies was reintroduced at the start of 2021, and Brown signed it into law Friday."
environment,"Oregon needs to modernize its approach to wildfires, which have grown bigger and more frequent across the western U.S. as climate change exacerbates heat and drought in the region."
environment,"“This year alone, we’ve already had nine major fires burned across Oregon ― twice as many as we had this time last year,” Brown said Friday. “Those on the front line will tell you that the Bootleg fire has behaved like no fire they have ever seen before, doubling in size each of the first several days and creating its own weather pattern.”"
environment,"“As we responded to these fires over the past couple of years ... it was really clear that we were battling with tools used in the last century,” Brown reflected Friday. “We were simply not equipped to fight the fires of this new age, which are faster and more fierce and fueled by the impacts of climate change.”"
environment,Brown was one of several governors to meet virtually with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday to discuss ways the federal government can better assist with wildfire response.
environment,"“We can’t ignore how the overlapping and intertwined factors ― extreme heat, prolonged drought and supercharged wildfire conditions ― are affecting the country,” Biden said. “And so this is a challenge that demands our urgent, urgent action.”"
environment,"Other governors present were Gavin Newsom (D) of California, Brad Little( R) of Idaho, Tim Walz (D) of Minnesota, Greg Gianforte (R) of Montana, Jay Inslee (D) of Washington and Mark Gordon (R) of Wyoming."
environment,"It’s a sharp pivot from former President Donald Trump, who frequently dismissed the role climate change played in wildfires and told Californians they merely needed to “rake” their forest floors better, even though many of the state’s biggest fires have happened on federally managed land. Last year, he turned down California’s request for wildfire disaster assistance. A former official in his administration also revealed that Trump didn’t want to give California any wildfire aid because it was a blue state."
environment,"GREENVILLE, Calif. (AP) — A wind-driven wildfire tore through a Northern California mountain town, leaving much of the downtown in ashes and crews braced for another explosive run of flames in the midst of dangerous weather."
environment,"The Dixie Fire, swollen by bone-dry vegetation and 40-mph gusts, raged through the northern Sierra Nevada town of Greenville Wednesday evening. Fire officials confirmed that some buildings were destroyed but had no details."
environment,"The town, which dates to California’s Gold Rush era, has some buildings more than a century old."
environment,"However, a photographer on assignment for The Associated Press described seeing a gas station, hotel and bar burned to the ground."
environment,"As the fire’s north and eastern sides exploded, the Plumas County Sheriff’s Office issued a Facebook posting warning the town’s approximately 800 residents: “You are in imminent danger and you MUST leave now!”"
environment,The three-week-old blaze was the state’s largest wildfire and had blackened well over 435 square miles and had already burned dozens of homes before making its new run.
environment,"Early in the week, some 5,000 firefighters had made progress on the blaze, saving some threatened homes, bulldozing pockets of unburned vegetation and managing to surround a third of the perimeter."
environment,"“We did everything we could,” fire spokesman Mitch Matlow said. “Sometimes it’s just not enough.”"
environment,"More fire engines and bulldozers were being ordered to bolster the fight, he said. On Wednesday, the fire grew by thousands of acres and an additional 4,000 people were ordered to evacuate, bringing nearly 26,500 people in several counties under evacuation orders, he said."
environment,"Red flag weather conditions of high heat, low humidity and gusty afternoon and evening winds erupted Wednesday and were expected to be a continued threat through Thursday evening."
environment,"The trees, grass and brush were so dry that “if an ember lands, you’re virtually guaranteed to start a new fire,” Matlow said."
environment,"“The fire behavior analyst said every single fire hazard is maxed out,” he added."
environment,"Dawn Garofalo watched the soaring cloud grow from the west side of Lake Almanor, where she fled with a dog and two horses, from a friend’s property near Greenville."
environment,"The blaze was also running parallel to a canyon area that served as a chimney, so hot that it created enormous pyrocumulus columns of smoke that bring chaotic winds, making it “critically erratic” and hard to predict the direction of growth, he added."
environment,"“There’s only one way in and one way out,” she said. “I didn’t want to be stuck up there if the fire came through.”"
environment,"From her campsite on the lake bed, she watched the fire glowing on the horizon before dawn."
environment,"About 150 miles to the west, the lightning-sparked McFarland Fire threatened remote homes along the Trinity River in the Shasta-Trinity National Forest. The fire was only 5% contained after burning through nearly 25 square miles (65 square kilometers) of drought-stricken vegetation."
environment,"Similar risky weather was expected across Southern California, where heat advisories and warnings were issued for interior valleys, mountains and deserts for much of the week."
environment,Heat waves and historic drought tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight in America’s West. Scientists say climate change has made the region much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.
environment,"More than 20,000 firefighters and support personnel were battling 97 large, active wildfires covering 2,919 square miles (7,560 square kilometers) in 13 U.S. states, the National Interagency Fire Center said."
environment,Hundreds of coastal sharks have flocked to a Florida canal in what experts said is an effort to take refuge from a catastrophic algal bloom that has wreaked havoc on ocean life in the region.
environment,"“You literally could have walked across the canal on the backs of sharks — that’s how many there were,” Longboat Key resident Janelle Branower told WFLA-TV."
environment,"In recent weeks, canals in Buttonwood Harbor, near Sarasota, have been teeming with sharks, including bonnethead, black tip, nurse and lemon sharks, leaving area residents stunned."
environment,"Red tide outbreaks, which are caused by the Karenia brevis algae, have been an issue on Florida’s west coast for several years. The organism occurs naturally in ocean water, but runoff from human activities can provide excess nutrients for the algae. That pollution, coupled with warming waters tied to climate change, can lead to uncontrollable algal blooms that kill marine organisms."
environment,"According to conservation groups, this year’s outbreak has been particularly devastating. Dolphins, manatees, turtles and hundreds of tons of dead fish have piled up on shorelines."
environment,"The sharks are likely seeking sanctuary in the canals away from the polluted ocean water, experts said."
environment,"“We don’t know what the trigger might be for those sharks going to those areas, but the changes in the chemistry of the water, the oxygen being pulled out of the water, the toxins, combined with the amount of dead fish around, any of those could cause these big concentrations,” Mike Heithaus, a shark expert and biological sciences professor at Florida International University, told The Guardian."
environment,Scientists are concerned that the heavily-packed waterways will be depleted of resources for the sharks before the red tide subsides.
environment,"If the red tide lasts for long enough, Morris said, the sharks could “run out of food and energy and unfortunately some of them, if not all of them, will die.”"
environment,"“If there’s not enough oxygen, they will overexert themselves trying to get fresh water over their gills so they can exchange their CO2 for oxygen. But with all those animals packed in that space, oxygen is limiting,” Mote Marine Laboratory senior biologist Jack Morris told FOX13 Tampa Bay."
environment,"The area is several miles from the defunct Piney Point fertilizer plant, which experienced a significant spill in April that saw hundreds of millions of gallons of wastewater pumped into Tampa Bay. It’s not yet clear whether the breach exacerbated the algae outbreak. "
environment,"In 2019, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) started the Red Tide Task Force as part of his administration’s efforts to mitigate the blooms in the state. Local communities and conservation groups have called on DeSantis to do more to combat the ecological crisis, including declaring a state of emergency."

environment,"Montana’s exclusive Yellowstone Club is a private playground for the rich and famous: world-class skiing and golfing, luxurious multimillion dollar homes nestled in the mountains, and the company of other elites. "
environment,"But in the near future, the club’s “private powder” — yes, it trademarked that phrase — will be generated in part from treated wastewater. The club and the broader community of Big Sky already use effluent to water four area golf courses, and the Montana Department of Environmental Quality has granted the private resort a permit to use more than 25 million gallons of wastewater for early-season snowmaking. The club’s environmental manager, Rich Chandler, has said the move “will help conserve our limited water supply and protect the watershed” by increasing snowpack and helping sustain river flows late in the season."
environment,"“Your mountain sanctuary awaits,” the club’s website says, alongside revolving videos of people fly fishing on the Gallatin River and skiing fresh lines on empty slopes. Bill Gates, Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen, Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel are just a few members of the Yellowstone Club, where condos start at around $4 million and mansions fetch upward of $25 million. "
environment,"Kinnaur Deputy Commissioner Abid Hussain Sadiq told the Express that it was a bright, sunny day, and the landslide was unexpected. "
environment,"A number of other ski resorts, including Snowbowl in Arizona, have also adopted waste-to-snow reuse, and several environmental and wildlife advocacy groups supported the Yellowstone Club’s effort. But there is something comically dystopian about America’s wealthiest spending a fortune to ski atop each other’s sewage. More seriously, it reflects long-standing water issues in the ritzy, unincorporated resort community of Big Sky, and the environmental costs of the area’s rapid growth."
environment,"The community has been home to Big Sky Resort, a public ski mountain, since the early 1970s, but the population has doubled in a little more than a decade, from around 1,500 in 2010 to 3,000 today. The 1992 film “A River Runs Through It” helped put this area on the map; many of the fly fishing scenes were filmed on the Gallatin River, a headwaters tributary of the Missouri River and a renowned “blue-ribbon” trout fishery that flows out of the northwest corner of Yellowstone National Park. The pandemic has only added to the boom, with people fleeing large cities to establish permanent residency in Big Sky. "
environment,Conservationists fear all this is fueling a crisis on the river. 
environment,"Since summer 2005, neon green algae — a telltale sign of an unhealthy river — has plagued the West Fork Gallatin, which flows directly through the resort town, leaving a “green trail” extending downstream of where the tributary dumps into the Gallatin. "
environment,"More recently, the problem has exploded on the river’s main stem. For the last three summers, the noxious algae has choked a large stretch of water around Big Sky, fouling one of the very resources that’s drawn wealthy Americans to gobble up property there. (See top video of drone footage shot by the Upper Missouri Waterkeeper in August 2020, showing a bloom of green algae along the Gallatin River, several miles downstream from the resort community of Big Sky.) An unprecedented bloom in 2018 stretched along more than 20 miles of the river and its tributaries, covering as much as 75% of the river bottom in some locations. "
environment,"Experts are working to pinpoint exactly what’s driving recent blooms, but chronic algae around Big Sky has been largely attributed to nutrient pollution from the area’s ballooning development. Nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorous occur naturally, but humans contribute even more from our septic tanks and other wastewater treatment systems, fertilizers, and clearing land for development. Pollution from America’s most prosperous is sullying a pristine watershed, with help from climate change-driven increases in air and water temperatures and reduced snowpack and river water levels."
environment,"This summer isn’t expected to be much better on the Gallatin. Montana is experiencing blistering, abnormal heat and drought conditions, and the green gunk is already in bloom."
environment,"This algae is nontoxic, but experts warn it can affect overall river health, reducing oxygen levels in the water and potentially harming fish and the bugs they feed on — never mind its ability to sully an angler’s experience."
environment,"Kristin Gardner is executive director of the Gallatin River Task Force, a community-based organization that monitors water quality and leads river restoration work. She said nutrient pollution remains a major issue in greater Big Sky, but that worsening climate impacts appear to have spurred the flare ups of algae on the main stem of the Gallatin in the last few years. The blooms were primarily concentrated in waters below the resort community; however, algae also appeared on a tributary upstream of Big Sky where there is little development."
environment,"“We have some of the best natural-state streams, and algae blooms are showing they are out of whack,” said Guy Alsentzer, executive director and founder of Upper Missouri Waterkeeper, an environmental group based in Bozeman. “Nutrients load the gun. Temperature and heat pulls the trigger.” "
environment,Water Woes
environment,"Three main streams — the West, Middle and South forks of the Gallatin — flow through Big Sky before draining into the river’s main stem a few miles below the resort town. All three have been designated “impaired” waterways for more than a decade due to nutrient loads that exceed state water standards."
environment,"Whatever the primary driver, stretches of water this clean and cold shouldn’t be clogged with algae. "
environment,"“The big change is not an increase in nutrients necessarily, but an increase in temperature and a decrease in stream flows,” she said."
environment,"“If you’d have told me that 20 years ago, I’d have said, ‘That’s silly. That can’t happen,’” said Toby Swank, president of Fins and Feathers, a Bozeman fly shop and guiding outfit. “What’s going on, it’s scary.” "
environment,"Environmentalists worry the river could soon reach a tipping point, when nutrient pollution and global warming unleash unstoppable changes. In light of the situation, Upper Missouri Waterkeeper is calling for the state to designate the main stem Gallatin as “impaired,” which would free up resources, and for a halt in new development until current sources of pollution are identified and addressed. Alsentzer said it is time for a science-based “pollution diet” in Big Sky: for proactive state policies to be implemented before it’s too late."
environment,"Lazy J South, a 200-acre residential and commercial development, first received a state groundwater discharge permit in 2006, but there’s been no construction. A new owner purchased the property last year and subsequently got approval from the state environmental quality department — or DEQ — to construct a septic system under the 14-year-old wastewater discharge permit."
environment,"“We shouldn’t be piecemeal approaching what’s happening in the greater community of Big Sky,” he said. “We need to take a holistic approach and the best thing to do right now is to hit pause. We need to hit pause on everything to let the science catch up and direct how we can grow without growth becoming a zero-sum game where the river is the loser.” "
environment,"Two projects in Big Sky Canyon Village, located along the Gallatin River several miles east of the Yellowstone Club and Big Sky proper, have come under intense scrutiny. "
environment,"Instead, the state has continued to greenlight new development that conservationists warn is likely to further degrade water quality on the Gallatin."
environment,Development Pressures
environment,"Upper Missouri Waterkeeper and Montana Environmental Information Center filed a lawsuit this month arguing that the DEQ failed to consider the cumulative effects that the development would have on water resources. The groups note in their legal filing that Lazy J South, which will sit less than half a mile from the Gallatin, could result in up to a 20% increase in total discharged septic pollution into area ground and surface water. "
environment,"A second development, known as Big Sky Quarry, is being marketed as a solution to the area’s shortage of workforce and affordable housing, although it’s not yet clear how much the units will cost. Big Sky Rock LLC is behind the 265-unit condo and family home development, which will be located just 800 feet from the Gallatin River."
environment,"“The Montana DEQ is asleep at the switch when it comes to protecting our water from irresponsible subdivisions and poorly planned development,” Derf Johnson, an attorney with the Montana Environmental Quality Information Center, said in a statement."
environment,"Project engineers initially had plans for a single, centralized water treatment system at the Quarry, but suddenly switched gears in 2018 for a series of septic systems that each fall below the gallon-per-day threshold that would require obtaining a discharge permit subject to a more stringent environmental review, according to documents Waterkeeper obtained via state public records requests and shared with HuffPost. "
environment,The emails indicate the developers changed course only after conversations with state regulators. 
environment,"“I was recently contacted by one of the project consultant engineers and told that they may no longer be seeking a discharge permit due to their recent conversation with [DEQ Subdivision Section Supervisor] Rachel Clark,” Chris Boe of the DEQ ’s Water Protection Bureau wrote in an August 2018 email to colleagues. Boe noted that his bureau had been working with Big Sky Rock LLC for more than two years on its abandoned centralized system, an effort that included “discussing discharge permitting options, and their need to analyze for cumulative effects and potential impacts to surface water.”"
environment,"The DEQ insisted that Quarry engineers were considering multiple septic systems long before agency staff sat down with project engineers for a pre-application meeting in November 2018. In response to HuffPost’s inquiry, the department produced an April 2017 memo in which one Quarry engineer notes that systems discharging more than 5,000 gallons per day require permits that “tend to take 12-18 months of review and are subject to public notice,” and that a phased system with each unit falling below that threshold “is an option to consider.”"
environment,"“The engineer came to the pre-application meeting with a proposal for multiple Level 2 septic systems,” DEQ spokesperson Moira Davin said in an email, adding that the planned system treats wastewater better than a standard septic system. "
environment,"Water and Environmental Technologies, an environmental consulting firm based in Butte, Montana, was brought on to assist with the Quarry project in 2018. Michael Nicklin, a senior consultant at the company, told HuffPost he recommended the developer consider using SepticNet, a modular septic system patented in 2006 that reduces nitrogen levels in wastewater to below the drinking water standard. Scott Altman, owner of Big Sky Rock LLC, the company behind the Quarry project, said the decision to use SepticNet was “based on the length of build out and getting the best treatment possible at every stage.” "
environment,"“You’ve got all these grandfathered systems going in that we know are causing water quality problems, but there’s no way to stop them at this point,” he said. "
environment,"Erickson said the problem in Big Sky isn’t the Quarry, which he applauded for its “state of the art treatment proposal,” but rather current development with antiquated septic systems. "
environment,"The Quarry will be the first development in Big Sky to use the technology, according to David Erickson, a co-owner of SepticNet and the founder of Water and Environmental Technologies. "
environment,"For Alsentzer, the bottom line is that the DEQ has the ability to require more of new developers given the existing problems on the Gallatin, but has instead chosen to grant categorical exclusions and ignore cumulative environmental effects. The river and landscape are suffering “a nefarious death by a thousand cuts,” he said. "
environment,"“We have an entire system of government that is corporate captured,” Alsentzer said. “If there’s ever a theme in Montana, it’s that our agencies aren’t looking out for the public anymore. They’re not looking out for the intrinsic value of our rivers or how to protect them from harm. They’re looking at how to incentivize and streamline business. They’re looking at how to make more money.”"
environment,"Among the documents Waterkeeper unearthed via its public records request is a state engineer’s response to Boe’s email about the Quarry’s change of plans. In it, John McDunn flagged a Montana administrative rule that gives the DEQ broad authority to “impose specific requirements for sewage treatment and disposal as are necessary and appropriate to” to protect water quality. "
environment,"Davin, the DEQ spokesperson, said the agency shares concerns about nutrients and algae in the Gallatin River and is supporting the Gallatin River Task Force’s monitoring and river restoration efforts with both state funding and technical assistance. As for DEQ’s authority to implement new safeguards, Davin said that “additional monitoring is needed before we can determine whether any additional requirements or limitations would be part of next steps.”"
environment,"When HuffPost reached John Meyer, executive director of Cottonwood Environmental Law Center, by phone last week, he was at the sewer district watching a hydrologist put fluorescent tracer dye into the wastewater holding ponds. "
environment,"Last summer, his firm and two conservation groups filed a lawsuit against the sewer district alleging that polluted water is leaching from the facility into the West Fork, in violation of the Clean Water Act, and that the district is irrigating a Big Sky golf course with treated wastewater with elevated levels of nitrogen. The dye will determine if wastewater is in fact making its way from the ponds to the West Fork. "
environment,"Meyer’s firm filed a motion in February asking a federal judge to bar the district from adding new sewer hookups, which would essentially impose a de facto moratorium on new development until the sewer district decreases nitrogen levels in its wastewater. The court is scheduled to hold a hearing next month for arguments in the case."
environment,A ‘Glimmer of Hope’
environment,"Big Sky’s water problems have almost certainly been exacerbated by the fact that the community is unincorporated, located in two separate counties and without the kind of central, municipal government that might, for example, enforce building codes. "
environment,"Developers, real estate agents, and resort and land managers sit on the boards of the local resort tax organization, the Big Sky community and recreation nonprofit, the sewer and water district, and the Gallatin River Task Force. "
environment,"People HuffPost interviewed for this story described it, among other things, as the “Wild West,” a sort of “fiefdom,” and a “company town” with little oversight and where residents’ incomes and livelihoods are directly tied to the lucrative development boom. "
environment,"And this isn’t just any boom. From February 2020 to February 2021, the median price of a single family home in greater Big Sky jumped an astonishing 65%, from $1.72 million to $2.85 million. "
environment,"“If anyone could do better, in terms of using technology, investments and science to figure out a way to control its impact on the waterway, [Big Sky] could do it,” Alsentzer said."
environment,"The biggest hurdle to future growth and development is treating and disposing of wastewater. With its nearly 20-year-old sewage treatment facility nearing capacity, Big Sky has had its back against the wall. The Yellowstone Club’s waste-to-snow effort will help alleviate some of the pressure, but not nearly enough. "
environment,"Late last year, the Gallatin County Commission signed off on the formation of a new sewer and water district in Gallatin Canyon ― a first step toward a more centralized system in greater Big Sky. Additionally, the Big Sky County Water and Sewer District is set to begin construction this summer on a nearly $50 million upgrade to its existing water treatment facility. Phase one of the project, slated to be complete in 2023, will increase the plant’s capacity by roughly 50% and significantly reduce nitrogen and phosphorus loads in treated water. A second phase will connect homes and subdivisions in Big Sky Canyon Valley, including the Quarry project, to the upgraded wastewater facility. Sewage from the canyon will be piped to Big Sky and treated, and the district is currently exploring different options for disposal, including groundwater discharge and reuse, according to Ron Edwards, general manager of the Big Sky Water and Sewer District and a member of the Gallatin River Task Force board."
environment,"“Towns of 3,000 people don’t build $50 million treatment plants,” Edwards said. For Big Sky to take on such a project is “a statement of what we believe in” as a headwaters community, he added."
environment,"“It’s the natural resource legacy that we’ve all been able to enjoy,” he said. “That includes clean and cold water. If we don’t have that, it really does cascade negatively to affect our enjoyment of this place, but also the economy.”"
environment,"Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) wants to see these resources forever safeguarded from pollution and special interests. He’s introduced legislation to designate 377 miles of rivers, including a 39-mile stretch of the upper Gallatin, as “wild and scenic,” the highest level of federal protection for waterways."
environment,"Montana state Sen. Pat Flowers (D-Belgrade), who represents Big Sky, called the planned infrastructure upgrades a “glimmer of hope on the horizon” but voiced concern about what will happen to water quality on the Gallatin in the years before the project is complete."
environment,Backward Steps In Big Sky Country
environment,Montana politicians love to recite the old adage that in Big Sky Country “whiskey is for drinking — water is for fighting.” And they’re quick to tout the clean rivers and wild trout that draw so many outdoor enthusiasts to the state each year. 
environment,"“The fishery has never been stronger,” Montana Gov. Greg Gianforte (R) said of the upper Missouri River in a May video about businesses in small towns like Craig gearing up for a busy summer season after a tough year during the coronavirus pandemic. "
environment,"That same week, Upper Missouri Waterkeeper alerted the DEQ to decomposing biological “gunk” extending along several miles of the Missouri River just above Craig. In a May 20 email response, which Waterkeeper shared with HuffPost, DEQ water quality supervisor ​​Darrin Kron wrote that “this condition does seem out of the ordinary for this time of year,” that the substance “could be a combo of last fall’s algae that is dead, and new growth,” but that his section is “very low on technical staffing resources at this time and can’t get out for monitoring or investigation.”"
environment,"Montana’s water woes aren’t limited to Big Sky or even the upper Missouri River. It’s in the middle of a statewide drought emergency declaration; more than one-third of its river miles are impaired by nutrient pollution; scientists have documented a severe decline in brown trout populations across the southwest part of the state; and each summer brings new harmful algal blooms and fish kills. Last week, a coalition of fly fishing businesses and conservation groups sent a letter to Gianforte warning that “Montana’s world-class cold water fisheries are dwindling away.”"
environment,"These mounting threats come as Gianforte plows ahead with a regressive environmental agenda. He has largely dismissed and ignored the threat of climate change, which threatens to devastate cold-water trout fisheries. Two weeks before his video along the Missouri River, the governor signed into law a bill that scrapped the numeric nutrient standards the state adopted just six years ago to better protect its water resources and prevent the kind of nutrient pollution that drives algal blooms, fish kills and other environmental threats. More recently, he withdrew Montana from a bipartisan coalition of more than two dozen states committed to upholding the goals of the Paris climate agreement, then turned around two days later and pleaded for the U.S. Department of Agriculture to declare a drought emergency across his state. "
environment,"“You’ve got to protect habitat if you want healthy fish,” he added."
environment,"“We’re dismantling our water quality laws in Montana. How do you think that’s going to play out for our trout fisheries?” Pat Byorth, a former state fisheries biologist who now works for Trout Unlimited and serves on the state Fish and Wildlife Commission, said on the fly fishing company Orvis’ podcast this week. "
environment,"Meanwhile, Gianforte is appealing to anglers and outdoor enthusiasts, inviting them to come enjoy “the last best place.”"
environment,"“Whether you imagine yourself knee deep in a crystal clear mountain stream, or soaking in the splendor of a Montana sunset on a quiet evening,” he wrote for the state’s tourism website, “Montana-made moments await you.”"
environment,"In the latest heartbreaking wounding of the environment, researchers have linked a deadly coral disease in the Caribbean to ship wastewater."
environment,"The infection, known as stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD), spreads more quickly than other known coral diseases and can travel up to 55 yards in a single day."
environment,"The rampaging blight that first hit Florida’s reefs in 2014 has now swept through the Bahamas, Jamaica, St. Maarten and Mexico, reports The Guardian. It’s also been found in 18 other countries."
environment,It also has an exceptionally high mortality rate among the most vulnerable species — and it may be the most lethal disease to ever infect coral. More than 30 species of coral are susceptible to SCTLD.
environment,"Scientists haven’t yet been able to determine whether the disease is caused by a virus, bacterium, chemical or some other infectious agent."
environment,"But a new study of SCTLD in the Bahamas — where it was first seen in 2019 — found that the coral disease was more prevalent in reefs that were closer to the main commercial ports in Nassau and Grand Bahama, suggesting that ship wastewater may be to blame for the disease."
environment,"“Spatial patterns of mortality and infection rates for the most vulnerable species were greatest close to international commercial shipping ports on both islands, suggesting SCTLD has been present in those locations for a longer time, and the proportion of healthy colonies increased with distance from the port,” noted the research by scientists from the Perry Institute for Marine Science in the Bahamas, which was published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science."
environment,Researchers noted that the “greatest declines” in coral populations in the Bahamas over the past decade may be “attributed to the recent introduction of stony coral tissue loss disease.”
environment,"SCTLD has infected coral off Grand Bahama Island along a 46-mile stretch. “That is a large structure of reef,” said Krista Sherman, senior scientist for the Perry Institute and co-author of the study. “We’re talking about mostly covering the entire southern coastline of the island.”"
environment,The International Maritime Organization implemented the Ballast Water Management Convention in 2017 in response to the spread of deadly pathogens by ships when they discharge ballast water. 
environment,"Under the convention, any ballast water released by ships must be at least 200 nautical miles from shore in water at least 200 meters (656 feet) deep before entering port to ensure the ships do not bring in pathogens."
environment,"Currently, the most effective treatment for the disease is the antibiotic amoxicillin, applied directly to the corals."
environment,The Bahamian government has established a national task force to address the issue in a nation where pristine water and beautiful coral reefs are a huge draw in the mighty tourist industry.
environment,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) — The final victim of the condo building collapse in Florida has been identified, a relative said Monday, more than a month after the middle-of-the-night catastrophe that ultimately claimed 98 lives and became the largest non-hurricane related emergency response in state history."
environment,"Estelle Hedaya, an outgoing 54-year-old with a love of travel, was the last to be identified, ending what her relatives described as a torturous four-week wait. Her younger brother, Ikey Hedaya, confirmed the news to The Associated Press. A funeral was scheduled for Tuesday."
environment,"“She always mentioned God anytime she was struggling with anything,” he said, adding he was drawing strength from God, just as he’d seen his sister do in troubling times."
environment,It comes just days after rescuers officially concluded the painstaking and emotionally heavy task of removing layers of dangerous debris and pulling out dozens of bodies.
environment,"The site of the June 24 collapse at the oceanside Champlain Towers South has been mostly swept flat, the rubble moved to a Miami warehouse. Although forensic scientists and rabbis are still at work, including examining the debris at the warehouse, seeking to recover any additional remains and personal items."
environment,"Search teams spent weeks battling the hazards of the rubble, including an unstable portion of the building that teetered above, a recurring fire and Florida’s stifling summer heat and thunderstorms. They went through more than 14,000 tons (13,000 metric tonnes) of broken concrete and rebar before finally declaring the mission complete."
environment,"In the end, crews found no evidence that anyone who was found dead had survived the initial collapse, Fire Chief Alan Cominsky has said."
environment,"“For the past 33 days they have searched the rubble as if they were searching for one of their own,” Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said during a news conference Monday."
environment,"Miami-Dade Fire Rescue’s urban search-and-rescue team pulled away from the site Friday in a convoy of firetrucks and other vehicles. Officials saluted their bravery, saying they had worked 12-hour shifts while camping out at the site and also dealing with the heavy emotional burden."
environment,The mayor expressed hope that those kindnesses would be “a powerful and lasting reminder of how deeply connected we truly are in the best of times and in the worst of times.”
environment,"The tragedy that befell the tiny town of Surfside prompted an outpouring of love from far and wide where locals donated their homes and apartments to victims, children colored cards for rescuers, piles and piles of food were donated and tens of millions of dollars raised for the victims."
environment,"The dead included members of the area’s large Orthodox Jewish community, the sister of Paraguay’s first lady, her family and their nanny, along with an entire family of four that included a local salesman, his wife and their two young daughters, 4 and 11, who were buried in the same coffin."
environment,"Leah Sutton, who knew Hedaya since birth and considered herself a second mother to her, said she and March were both “forces to be reckoned with.”"
environment,"Linda March, a 58 year-old attorney and fellow former New Yorker, was close friends with Hedaya. Oddly the two were the last three victims to be identified, along with 24-year-old Anastasia Gromova of Canada."
environment,"Meanwhile, it’s unclear what will happen at the collapse site. A judge presiding over several lawsuits filed in the collapse aftermath wants the property sold at market rates, which would bring in an estimated $100 million or more. Some condo owners want to rebuild, and others say a memorial should be erected to remember the dead."

environment,"Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) warned Sunday the state would likely see more devastating wildfires linked to climate change as firefighters continue to battle the mammoth Bootleg Fire, the largest blaze in the United States this year that is still burning near the state’s border with California."
environment,"Brown made the comments on CNN’s “State of the Union,” telling host Jake Tapper that an increase in extreme weather, including heat waves and drought, linked to climate change made it urgently important for wildlife officials to prepare for future blazes."
environment,"“The harsh reality is that we’re going to see more of these wildfires,” Brown told Tapper. “They’re hotter, they’re more fierce, and obviously much more challenging to tackle. And they are a sign of the changing climate impacts.”"
environment,"Oregon has already suffered from several natural disasters in recent months, including the unprecedented “heat dome” that settled over the Pacific Northwest in June. Around 100 people died in the state due to phenomenal temperatures that reached 118 degrees Fahrenheit in some areas, a figure Brown said at the time was only a “harbinger of things to come.”"
environment,"The Bootleg Fire, which began July 6, is the third-largest fire in Oregon since 1900 and is just 46% contained, prompting fire officials to warn Sunday that it could grow due to ongoing hot, dry conditions. It’s already scorched more than 401,000 acres of forest and grassland, and as The New York Times notes, has grown so large it’s creating its own weather patterns."
environment,"She continued: “Climate change is here, it’s real, and it’s like a hammer hitting us in the head. And we have to take action.”"
environment,Officials said the fire spawned a tornado earlier this month.
environment,"Brown added that the federal government had helped support the state as it battled the blaze, but said it would remain a multibillion-dollar issue not just for Oregon, but for adjoining states."

She later added: “We’re going to need to partner throughout the West to tackle these issues. As you well know, wildfire knows no jurisdictional boundaries.”"
environment,“I normally avoid these refs..but WOW. REAL LIFE Sponge bob and Patrick!” tweeted marine biologist Christopher Mah alongside an image of the aquatic pair on Tuesday.
environment,"He added, “Scientific names: Hertwigia (sponge) and Chondraster (starfish).”"
environment,"The image came from a livestream of a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration deepwater expedition. The sponge and sea star were seen about 1,885 meters underwater on Retriever Seamount, which is one of four undersea mountains that make up the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument in the Atlantic Ocean."
environment,"Temperatures in the Columbia River, which originates in Canada and forms part of the Washington-Oregon border, have well exceeded 68 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature at which salmon face an increased risk of stress, disease and mortality, according to Columbia Riverkeeper."
environment,"“This is a decades-long issue for Oregon, Washington and the Columbia River tribes,” Michelle Dennehy of the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife told HuffPost in response to the video. “We do have some mortality every year, but we’re expecting it to be worse this year because we have the record drought and the heat.”"

environment,"SpongeBob and Patrick are famously best friends in the Nickelodeon show. But in real life, Chondraster stars are carnivores that are known to eat sea sponges, Mah told Business Insider."
environment,The underwater video shared by Columbia Riverkeeper on Tuesday shows multiple sockeye salmon with large welts and open sores swimming in Washington state’s Little White Salmon River near the Columbia River Gorge on July 16.
environment,"Sockeye salmon are protected under the Endangered Species Act, and Oregon, among other states, has been working to improve the fishes’ migratory passage and to identify and protect cool-water fish refuges. The state also recently imposed emergency fishing restrictions for certain river areas after 2 p.m. when high temperatures make the fish particularly vulnerable to stress, said Dennehy."
environment,"Oregon, Washington and the Nez Perce Tribe also recently requested that a reservoir in northern Idaho release cold water to help lower temperatures in the Snake River, which runs through Idaho and along the border with Oregon before flowing into Washington. Cold water was released in June to help salmon and steelhead trout ― several weeks ahead of schedule due to extreme heat ― but the federal government declined to do it again, reasoning that it would lead to unsafe boating conditions, Idaho’s Moscow-Pullman Daily News reported."
environment,"That’s because sockeye salmon already face numerous risks while attempting to spawn in freshwater streams, rivers and lakes after migrating inland from the ocean."
environment,"“The state of Oregon has long said that the federal government is failing fish by not providing adequate fish protections in the federally managed river, and that includes adequate water and cool water,” Dennehy said, warning that it’s not just today’s fish at risk, but future generations. "
environment,"Adult salmon lay their eggs in these waterways, and one to three years later, the young fish, called smolt, attempt to migrate out to the ocean, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration."
environment,"A disturbing new video is highlighting the devastating effect of recent heat waves on Pacific Northwest salmon, which are suffering from lesions and fungus due to rising water temperatures, according to a nonprofit organization working to protect the waterways."
environment,"“Sockeye are dying right now because the Columbia and Snake rivers are too hot,” Brett VandenHeuvel, the organization’s executive director, said in a statement that blamed thermal stress for the condition of the fish. “I’m hopeful this tragedy will inspire our elected leaders to take action to restore our rivers before it is too late.”"
environment,"“Smolt may never make it to the ocean due to high temperatures and poor habitat conditions along the way,” said Dennehy. “Poor migratory conditions associated with temperature can also cause returning salmon and steelhead to die before they can reach spawning areas, which will impact the next generation of salmon.” "
environment,"“Regulating water temperature is a huge issue,” said Dennehy. “Unfortunately, with climate change, we are expecting these droughts and heat waves to become more frequent and deadly to fish.”"
environment,Unusually warm temperatures have already been blamed for mass salmon deaths and illness.
environment,"“They can’t even make it to their home, to spawn, to reproduce,” Don Sampson of the Northwest Tribal Salmon Alliance said in a separate video shared by the Columbia Riverkeeper. “They’re suffocating. They’re weakened.”"
environment,"Sampson criticized local dams for slowing the flow of water and creating stagnant reservoirs that can overheat. The larger surface area of the water that’s exposed to the sun raises water temperatures as much as 5.7 degrees, according to a 2020 report by the Environmental Protection Agency, which examined the effects of dams on the Snake and Columbia river systems in the Washington state area."
environment,"The fish in the video were in an area where they do not spawn, according to Columbia Riverkeeper, suggesting that they had yet to reach the destination where they lay their eggs."
environment,"Earlier this month, salmon in Northern California were reportedly dying from rising water temperatures that threatened the entire local population. In 2015, about 90% of sockeye salmon that entered the Columbia River died from a combination of low water and extended extreme heat that hadn’t been seen since at least the 1950s, The Associated Press reported."
environment,"A coalition of climate-focused groups is readying a multimillion-dollar blitz of advertising, organizing and public events over Congress’s recess in August, seeing it as their best and last opportunity to influence members before Democrats start crafting crucial climate legislation this fall."
environment,"This year’s heat waves have also been particularly brutal, with one marine biologist estimating that 1 billion sea creatures recently cooked to death off Canada’s coast. "
environment,"The coalition will host more than 500 events nationally, aiming to engage more than 1 million Americans, with a focus on states represented by moderate Democrats in the House and Senate who could make or break a deal. In total, the groups appear set to spend more than $20 million over the six-week period when members of the House and Senate leave Washington and head home to hear from their constituents. "
environment,"“This is the moment where we have an opportunity to move forward with bold climate policy, to meet the moment, to meet what science calls for and demands,” said Pete Maysmith, the senior vice president for campaigns at the League of Conservation Voters. “And we know that there is deep and strong support for it around the country. And so really what August is about is mobilizing that support.”"
environment,"After bipartisan negotiations whittled down many of the key climate proposals in President Joe Biden’s infrastructure package, climate groups and Democrats now see a separate piece of legislation ― set to be passed using a process called reconciliation that allows Democrats to bypass the filibuster’s 60 vote requirement ― as key to Biden’s pledge to combat the climate crisis. "
environment,"That legislation is set to be shaped over the course of months, with environmental groups and progressives aiming to include a clean-electricity standard and a civilian climate corps, among other climate-focused goals. But some of those provisions could face resistance from moderate Democrats, including Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona."
environment,"In the past, interactions between voters and their members of Congress during the lengthy August recess ― this year’s break is set to run well into September ― have shaped the political mood in Washington, most famously when the so-called tea party Republicans ratcheted up opposition to President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. The coalition’s goal is to make climate action the dominant and defining issue of this recess."
environment,"“We know how popular these investments are,” said Felice Stadler, the vice president of campaigns at the Environmental Defense Fund Action. “But if we take our foot off the pedal and just assume that members know that this is important, we’re going to miss our opportunity.” "
environment,"The coalition is made up of more than 100 groups, including BlueGreen Alliance, Climate Action Campaign, Climate Power, Climate Reality, EDF Action, Environment America, the Green New Deal Network, the League of Conservation Voters, the Moms Clean Air Force and the Sierra Club."
environment,The events will include everything from roundtables with small-business owners to town halls with members of Congress to an electric bus tour and rallies organized by faith groups.
environment,"The League of Conservation Voters is hiring 100 canvassers operating out of 15 offices in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia; and the Climate Action Campaign plans to spend $10 million on local organizing campaigns across 12 states and 19 competitive House districts.

environment,"Still traumatized by 2012’s deadly Superstorm Sandy, New York City has in recent years sued oil giants, divested its pension funds of coal stocks, and outlined lofty plans to protect the coastal metropolis from rising seas and extreme weather. "
environment,And the city’s fire department advanced new codes that could significantly shrink the amount of roof space available for solar equipment and create costly new requirements for building owners looking to add panels. 
environment,Fossil Fuels Drink Solar’s Milkshake
environment,"“There’s no pot at the end of the rainbow for people building and installing solar in New York City,” said Shyam Mehta, the executive director of the New York Solar Energy Industries Association. “It’s very difficult already. These policy issues make it more so.”"
environment,"New York state created its community solar program in 2015 to subsidize the construction of panels to which renters, barred from building atop roofs they don’t own, could subscribe and lower their bills. It took a few years to get off the ground in New York City and its northern suburb of Westchester County, the area served by the private utility monopoly Consolidated Edison. In 2018, the program produced 3 megawatts of panels within the ConEd service area. "
environment,"Yet this year the nation’s largest city became more dependent on fossil fuels for its electricity as the nuclear plant that provided most of its zero-carbon electricity shut down and a plan to build a transmission line to carry hydropower down to the Hudson River from dams in Canada, first proposed in 2008, continued to flounder."
environment,"With limited space to build renewables and political power over its own infrastructure, glazing rooftops across the five boroughs with solar panels is widely seen as the easiest and most affordable way to generate renewable power within city limits ― and a source of jobs and training for an industry set for exponential growth if the U.S. fulfills its climate goals."
environment,But two looming policy changes threaten to make rooftop solar harder and more expensive to build.
environment,"The state program that financed solar projects on the roofs of some of the poorest and most pollution-plagued New Yorkers is poised to run out of money as early as the end of summer, in part because a loophole allowed fossil fuel infrastructure to use up a giant chunk of the funding. "
environment,"A year later, that number swelled more than sevenfold to 22 megawatts. "
environment,"Climate Power plans to spend $10 million on digital, television and newspaper ads in 29 House districts and five states that are expected to have competitive Senate races. And the Green New Deal network is planning to host 60 events across the country on a single day in August. "
environment,"In 2020, however, that number soared to 89 megawatts, making community solar by far the fastest-growing segment of the city’s solar sector. "
environment,"In the meantime, the program has created nearly two dozen temporary jobs, with the majority of workers finding work in solar after installations were completed."
environment,"For residents of New York City’s sprawling public housing complexes, the program brought hope to places that most often offer examples of what happens when a super-rich metropolis fails to protect its poorest residents: Mold and pest infestations, lead-poisoned babies, grandparents left to freeze in winter without heat and roast in summer without air conditioning. "
environment,"Yet as the solar projects ramped up, a loophole allowed natural gas-fired fuel cells to eat up more than 160 megawatts’ worth of funding in the community solar program. By the time state regulators closed the loophole in 2019, the fossil fuel equipment used up about half the funding available for the New York City service area. "
environment,"“I love it,” Bellow told NY1 of the job. “I love every aspect of it.”"
environment,"Kelvin Casimiro, a 22-year-old NYCHA resident, similarly struggled to find work after he was laid off last year until a nonprofit working with the community solar program recruited him to build panels atop the Queensbridge Houses, the largest public housing complex in North America."
environment,"“I have applied for solar jobs before but have not received any positive answers because I had no prior experience in solar installations,” Casimiro said in an official NYCHA newsletter last month. “It is a great opportunity, because solar jobs are on the rise. Everyone is interested.”"
environment,"Lugging cinder blocks across the roof of a public housing development in south Brooklyn in March, Sarah Bellow, a New York City Housing Authority (NYCHA) resident who lost her job during the pandemic, said getting hired to install solar panels offered reprieve from the “mental effect of not working.” "
environment,"In March, the city government, NYCHA, and a handful of solar nonprofits filed a petition with the state Public Service Commission requesting the state extend the program, which was set to run out of funding. At the very least, they asked that the state replace the funding the fossil fuel projects used up so they could go to solar projects instead. Roughly 40 megawatts of funding remain in the program, said Mehta, who estimated those will run out in, at most, three months. "
environment,"Without an extension, Mehta said “most solar projects will become uneconomically viable overnight.”"
environment,"The commission said it was “reviewing all options given the concerns raised by the industry, and we are carefully considering the comments submitted in the community solar program.” The body meets once per month, meaning it likely has no more than two sessions to address the issue before the program suffers a funding shortfall. "
environment,"While advocates and solar installers wait nervously, analysts say the state is likely to keep the program going."
environment,"In a statement, Mayor Bill de Blasio’s office said it was urging the commission to expand the program “given the acute need to transition away from fossil fuels.” "
environment,The New York City Fire Department’s proposed new codes could affect virtually all new rooftop solar projects in the city. 
environment,"“Speculatively, I would not be surprised if they extend it because it’s clearly been clearly effective,” said Pol Lezcano, a solar analyst at the energy consultancy BloombergNEF. "
environment,Firefighters Propose ‘A Hard Pill To Swallow’
environment,"The department called on the city to revise the fire code to leave six-feet-wide openings around roof drains and on the perimeters of smaller buildings, and make expensive upgrades to parapet walls. "
environment,"The most challenging measure proposed in the codes was a requirement for building owners to keep 30% of the rooftop facing the rear or any side of the building with windows completely clear of any panels so firefighters can easily traverse the space. Doing so, the Solar Energy Industries Association calculated, would reduce the available area for panels by roughly 40%, and in some cases more."
environment,"The proposed revisions also include mandates to reinforce parapets on buildings, a requirement solar installers said could make rooftop panels even more expensive. "
environment,"“It’s well understood that New York City’s fire code, as it exists right now, already places more restrictions on rooftop solar construction than any other fire code in the nation,” Mehta said. “Without demonstrating the necessity of these restrictions for firefighters or public safety, it’s a really hard pill to swallow.” "
environment,"In an email to HuffPost, the fire department said it planned to withdraw the 30% proposal and limit “its perimeter access proposal to newly-constructed buildings” over the solar industry’s concerns. "
environment,"“The Department will continue to work with the Mayor’s Office of Climate and Sustainability to address any concerns expressed by clean energy stakeholders,” deputy commissioner Frank Dwyer, the spokesman, said. "
environment,Lezcano said the existing fire code has “prevented a lot of installers from even looking at the city as a potential new market.” 
environment,"“Unless you’re a city installer and you’re able to afford the time to navigate the bureaucracy and administrative permitting, there’s very little reason for you to be in the city,” he said. “I know of multiple installers who have decided not to expand to New York City because of all the additional work it would require in terms of having people with boots on the ground just to deal with the regulatory aspects.” "
environment,The State vs. The City
environment,"The city could not, for example, enact new congestion pricing tolls to limit vehicle traffic into Manhattan without legislation passed by the state. Any changes and investments in the subway and system most New Yorkers rely on must also run through Albany, since the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is under state control. "
environment,New York City’s efforts to curb its greenhouse gas emissions have long been dogged by the state’s unwillingness or inability to deliver on them. 
environment,"Even the city’s landmark 2019 climate law ― a mandate for big buildings, the largest energy users in the five boroughs, to install energy efficiency retrofits ― has faced pushback from the state, as Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) proposed new carve-outs for landlords that critics say would defang the legislation."
environment,"New York state officials say they want the state to rapidly eliminate carbon from its electricity grid. But as the state charges ahead with implementing its 100% by 2040 clean power law, some fear its eponymous city could become an afterthought. That’s because the state can largely hit some of its early renewable electricity targets with big solar farms in the state’s sparsely populated northern regions, where open space and looser regulations make energy development cheaper."
environment,"Two projects in or near the city could balance that regional disparity. The first, a proposal to close the notorious jail on Rikers Island and replace it with solar panels and batteries, could create a central hub for some clean electricity production, conveniently near the 500-acre electrical utility complex in northwest Queens. The second, already underway, is an array of offshore wind turbines expected to come online off the coast of Long Island and New Jersey sometime in the next three to four years. "
environment,"In the meantime, however, a different proposal has consumed the attention of pro-renewable lawmakers and environmentalists in the city: a plan to build new gas-fired generators in Queens and Brooklyn. "
environment,"“The city has to come up with a plan to help us mitigate the situation,” said Charles Callaway, the director of organizing at We Act for Environmental Justice, a Harlem-based advocacy group. “We can help our community put solar on top of buildings in a way that we can reduce the amount of emissions and continue to protect firemen.”"
environment,"HONOLULU (AP) — Hawaii officials wrongly arrested a homeless man for a crime committed by someone else, locked him up in a state hospital for more than two years, forced him to take psychiatric drugs and then tried to cover up the mistake by quietly setting him free with just 50 cents to his name, the Hawaii Innocence Project said in a court document asking a judge to set the record straight."
environment,A petition filed in court Monday night asks a judge to vacate the arrest and correct Joshua Spriestersbach’s records. The filing lays out his bizarre plight that started with him falling asleep on a sidewalk. He was houseless and hungry while waiting in a long line for food outside a Honolulu shelter on a hot day in 2017.
environment,"When a police officer roused him awake, he thought he was being arrested for the city’s ban on sitting or laying down on public sidewalks."
environment,"But what he didn’t realize was that the officer mistook him for a man named Thomas Castleberry, who had a warrant out for his arrest for violating probation in a 2006 drug case."
environment,"It’s unclear how this happened as Spriestersbach and Castleberry had never met. Spriestersbach somehow ended up with Castleberry as his alias, even though Spriestersbach never claimed to be Castleberry, according to the Hawaii Innocence Project."
environment,Spriestersbach’s attorneys argue it all could have been cleared up if police simply compared the two men’s photographs and fingerprints.
environment,"Instead, against Spriestersbach’s protests that he wasn’t Castleberry, he was eventually committed to the Hawaii State Hospital."
environment,"The psychiatrist asked a detective to come to the hospital, who verified fingerprints and photographs to determine the wrong man had been arrested and Spriestersbach spent two years and eight months institutionalized, the petition said, noting that it wasn’t hard to determine the the real Castleberry has been incarcerated in an Alaska prison since 2016."
environment,"All it took were simple Google searches and a few phone calls to verify that Spriestersbach was on another island when Castleberry was initially arrested, according to the court document."
environment,"According to records, a 49-year-old man named Thomas R. Castleberry is in the Spring Creek Correctional Facility in Seward, Alaska. His relatives couldn’t be reached for comment. The Alaska public defender listed for him declined to comment Tuesday."
environment,The Hawaii Innocence Project document also claims Spriestersbach had ineffective counsel: the Hawaii public defender’s office.
environment,"Police, the state public defender’s office, the state attorney general and the hospital “share in the blame for this gross miscarriage of justice,” the petition said."
environment,"“Yet, the more Mr. Spriestersbach vocalized his innocence by asserting that he is not Mr. Castleberry, the more he was declared delusional and psychotic by the H.S.H. staff and doctors and heavily medicated,” the petition said. “It was understandable that Mr. Spriestersbach was in an agitated state when he was being wrongfully incarcerated for Mr. Castleberry’s crime and despite his continual denial of being Mr. Castleberry and providing all of his relevant identification and places where he was located during Mr. Castleberry’s court appearances, no one would believe him or take any meaningful steps to verify his identity and determine that what Mr. Spriestersbach was telling the truth – he was not Mr. Castleberry.”"
environment,No one believed him — not even his various public defenders — until a hospital psychiatrist finally listened.
environment,Hawaii Public Defender James Tabe and spokespersons for the state attorney general’s and health department didn’t immediately return messages seeking comment Tuesday.
environment,"Spriestersbach, 50, who lives with his sister in Vermont, declined to comment for this story."
environment,"Once the fingerprints and photographs were finalized, officials moved quickly, but secretly, to release Spriestersbach in January 2020, the petition said."
environment,"His lawyers think officials didn’t think anyone would believe Spriestersbach or no one would care about the homeless man who fell asleep waiting for food, only to wake up to a living nightmare."
environment,"“A secret meeting was held with all of the parties, except Mr. Spriestersbach, present. There is no court record of this meeting or no public court record of this meeting. No entry or order reflects this miscarriage of justice that occurred or a finding that Mr. Spriestersbach is not Thomas Castleberry,” the court document said."
environment,"His sister, Vedanta Griffith, spent nearly 16 years looking for him. He moved to Hawaii with Griffith when her husband was stationed on Oahu with the Army in 2003. He moved to the Big Island and then disappeared, while suffering mental health issues, she said."
environment,"“Part of what they used against him was his own argument: ‘I’m not Thomas Castleberry. I didn’t commit these crimes. ... This isn’t me,’” she told The Associated Press. “So they used that as saying he was delusional, as justification for keeping him.”"
environment,"After his release, he ended up at a homeless shelter, which contacted his family."
environment,Spriestersbach now refuses to leave his sister’s 10-acre property.
environment,"“And then when light is shown on it, what do they do? They don’t even put it on the record. They don’t make it part of the case,” Griffith said. “And then they don’t come to him and say, ‘We are so sorry’ or, how about even ‘Gee, this wasn’t you. You were right all along.’”"
environment,"It’s then that the already emotional post takes a truly gut-wrenching turn. The ranger hears a stick snap and sees another bear nearby. At first, the ranger thinks maybe the bear is scavenging or is possibly also trying to cross the road."
environment,"The bear turned out to be a cub around 6 months old. The ranger, whose name is not given, carries the cub away from the road to a grassy spot. The ranger notes the cub is female, which “immediately triggers thoughts of the life this bear may have lived ― perhaps she would have had cubs of her own.”"
environment,Yosemite National Park shared a heartbreaking story from a ranger that illustrates the deadly consequences of driving recklessly or too fast in the park.
environment,"The meaning is clear: “This bear is the mom, and she never left her cub.”"
environment,"AP journalist Mark Thiessen in Anchorage, Alaska, contributed to this report."
environment,"“We get this call a lot,” begins the now-viral post, shared on the park’s social media accounts on Friday. “Too much, to be honest. ‘Bear hit by vehicle, dead on the side of the road.’ Sadly, it’s become routine.”"
environment,"“But then I hear it, and it changes my mind completely,” the ranger wrote. “From behind me there’s a deep toned but soft sounding grunt. I immediately know what it is. It’s a vocalization, the kind sows (female bears) make to call to their cubs.”"
environment,"“The calls to the cub continue, sounding more pained each time,” the post reads. “I glance back finding myself hoping it would respond to her call too, but of course, nothing. Now here I am, standing between a grieving mother and her child. I feel like a monster.”"
environment,"“We don’t take this action lightly; we know that it’s going to impose hardships on folks,” she said."
environment,The western United States is in the midst of an historic drought that is emptying reservoirs and contributing to massive wildfires.

Scientists have long warned that the weather will get wilder as the world warms. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years. Special calculations are needed to determine how much global warming is to blame, if at all, for a single extreme weather event."
environment,"The ranger quickly left, but first set up a camera to capture the “sad reality” of animals hit by cars in Yosemite.

environment,"The vast Sakha-Yakutia region of Siberia has had a long spell of extremely hot and dry weather this summer, with temperatures reaching 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) and setting records for several days. The heat wave helped spark hundreds of fires, which so far have scorched more than 1.5 million hectares (3.7 million acres) of land, making it the worst-affected region in Russia."
environment,"Fedot Tumusov, a member of the Russian parliament who represents the region, called the blazes “unprecedented” in their scope."
environment,Monitoring Difficulties
environment,The forests that cover huge areas of Russia make monitoring and quickly spotting new fires a daunting task.
environment,"In recent years, Russia has recorded high temperatures that many scientists regard as a clear result of climate change. The hot weather has caused permafrost to melt and fueled a growing number of fires."
environment,"In 2007, a federal network to spot fires from aircraft was disbanded and had its assets turned over to regional authorities. The much-criticized change resulted in the program’s rapid deterioration."
environment,"The government later reversed the move and reestablished the federal agency in charge of monitoring forests from the air. However, its resources remain limited, making it hard to survey the massive forests of Siberia and the Far East."
environment,Neglect of Fire Safety Rules
environment,"Authorities regularly conduct controlled burns, setting a fire to clear the way for new vegetation or to deprive unplanned wildfires of fuel. Observers say such intentional burns often are poorly managed and sometimes trigger bigger blazes instead of containing them."
environment,"While some wildfires are sparked by lightning, experts estimate that over 70% of them are caused by people, from carelessly discarding cigarettes to abandoned campfires, but there are other causes."
environment,Arson
environment,Farmers also use the same technique to burn grass and small trees on agricultural lands. Such burns regularly get out of control.
environment,Record Heat
environment,Some factors behind Russia’s endemic wildfires and their consequences:
environment,Activists and experts say that fires are often set deliberately to cover up evidence of illegal lumbering or to create new places for timber harvesting under the false pretext of clearing burned areas.
environment,"Activists in Siberia and the Far East allege such arson is driven by strong demand for timber in the colossal Chinese market, and they have called for a total ban on timber exports to China."
environment,"Critics blame the 2007 forest code that gave control over timberlands to regional authorities and businesses, eroding centralized monitoring, fueling corruption and contributing to illegal tree-cutting practices that help spawn fires."
environment,"Officials have acknowledged the problem and pledged to tighten oversight, but Russia’s far-flung territory and regulatory loopholes make it hard to halt the illegal activity."
environment,Controversial Regulations
environment,"Critics have long assailed the provision, arguing it encourages inaction by authorities and slows firefighting efforts so a blaze that could have been extinguished at a relatively small cost is often allowed to burn uncontrolled."
environment,Russian law allows authorities to let wildfires burn in certain areas if the potential damage is considered not worth the costs of containing them.
environment,"“They eventually have to extinguish it anyway, but the damage and the costs are incomparable,” said Mikhail Kreindlin of Greenpeace Russia."
environment,"
Long-Term Consequences
In addition to destroying trees, wildfires also kill wildlife and pose a threat to human health by polluting the air.
Carbon emissions from fires and the destruction of forests, which are a major source of oxygen, also contribute to global warming and its potentially catastrophic impact.
This year’s fires in Siberia already have emitted more carbon than those in some previous years, according to Mark Parrington, a senior scientist at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.
He said the peat fires that are common in Siberia and many other Russian regions are particularly harmful in terms of emissions because peat has been absorbing carbon for tens of thousands of years.
“Then it’s releasing all that carbon back into the atmosphere,” Parrington said.
While pledging adherence to the Paris agreement on climate change, Russian officials often underline the key role played by their forests in slowing down global warming. However, regular wildfires have the opposite effect, dramatically boosting carbon emissions.
“They emphasize that huge areas are covered by forests but neglect the effect of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from fires,” Greenpeace’s Kreindlin said.

environment,A baby orca named Toa has captured the hearts of New Zealanders and sparked a frantic nationwide search for his family after he was found stranded on rocks nearly two weeks ago.
environment,"Orcas don’t typically wean until 1 to 2 years of age, meaning he requires constant monitoring."
environment,"The calf, thought to be 3 to 6 months old, has been receiving round-the-clock care from a massive cast that includes whale rescue groups, volunteers, the local Māori tribe Ngāti Toa Rangatira and the country’s Department of Conservation (DOC)."
environment,"Toa had been staying in a sea-pen in the harbor but was moved to a 8,400-gallon seawater pool in the carpark of a local boating club for several days to protect him and his carers during the rough weather."
environment,He was successfully transferred back into his sea-pen Thursday night in an effort to help with injuries to his fins and an inflamed eye. He had also become more lethargic and stopped vocalizing as much as he had.
environment,"Toa, which means fighter or hero in Māori, was found near Plimmerton, just north of the New Zealand capital of Wellington, on July 11. Since then, the difficult mission to keep Toa safe and healthy has been marred by bad weather. Last week, a violent storm tore through the region, bringing massive swells, flooding and a sewage spill into the harbor."
environment,"“As soon as the calf was back in the sea, he started calling and zooming around the pen,” said Ian Angus, marine species manager for the DOC. "
environment,“We remain focused on trying to find the orca calf’s pod. Our efforts will be focused on the lower half of the North Island and upper half of the South Island.”
environment,"Toa’s primary caregiver is Ingrid Visser, the only person in the country with a doctorate in New Zealand orcas. She’s been with Toa since the start and has been monitoring him on site day and night while directing volunteers on how to help him, according to The Guardian."
environment,"In a Wellington whale watch Facebook group, updates from locals, volunteers and tipsters appear almost hourly as people share images and videos of the little orca and desperately try to locate his family."
environment,"The DOC has opened up a tip line for people to report orca sightings anywhere in the country, given orcas can travel up to 100 miles a day."
environment,"However, as time drags on, experts have raised concern about his welfare. "
environment,"Karen Stockin, a marine biologist, told the NZ Herald that if Toa’s pod can’t be found, there are only two options: euthanasia or putting him into a purpose-built rehabilitation facility, which New Zealand does not have. Other experts have also raised concerns about his ability to reintegrate with his pod the more time he spends in human care."

Five firefighters were injured Thursday when swirling winds blew flames back on them as they worked on the Devil’s Creek fire burning in rough, steep terrain near the rural town of Jordan, in the northeast part of the state."
environment,"They remained hospitalized Friday. Bureau of Land Management spokesperson Mark Jacobsen declined to release the extent of their injuries, and attempts to learn their conditions Saturday were unsuccessful. Three of the firefighters are U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service crew members from North Dakota, and the other two are U.S. Forest Service firefighters from New Mexico."

environment,"“I went back the next day and replaced that,” Crouser said."
environment,"Crouser’s childhood throws in his grandfather’s backyard were unpredictable at times. Once, he lobbed one through the top of the garden shed."
environment,"Time marched on. Eventually, Larry Crouser lost his hearing. Ryan started writing notes."
environment,The last one might have been the most important.
environment,"“They had a letter correspondence going back and forth,” his mother explained."
environment,"Even for the world record-holder and defending champion, the note was something of a leap of faith. But Crouser figured that, at worst, no one would ever find out about it. Turns out, he was spot-on. After the win, he proudly displayed it as he paraded around in his cowboy hat."
environment,Crouser put pen to paper in his room a few days ago to calm his nerves. Not so much about the event — he wasn’t nervous — but about possibly testing positive for the coronavirus. The positive test that knocked pole vaulter Sam Kendricks out of the Olympics rattled him.
environment,Crouser’s grandpa was alive June 18 to see him break a 31-year-old world record at the U.S. Olympic trials.
environment,"“He watched that throw on the iPad, thousands and thousands of times,” Crouser said. “He’s been my biggest fan.”"
environment,"Asked how far that throw might have gone at his grandfather’s place, Crouser laughed and said: “It would have been into the neighbor’s yard. I don’t know if it would have hit a building, maybe a house.”"
environment,The note he wrote after that one was simple: “World-record holder.”
environment,"On a steamy day in Tokyo, Crouser clapped his hands after his final attempt — sending chalk dust into the air. Later, he went over and shared a hug and a handshake with his father, Mitch, who serves as his coach."
environment,"This win, though, was for Grandpa Larry."
environment,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — As drought- and wind-driven wildfires have become more dangerous across the American West in recent years, firefighters have tried to become smarter in how they prepare."
environment,"They’re using new technology and better positioning of resources in a bid to keep small blazes from erupting into mega-fires like the ones that torched a record 4% of California last year, or the nation’s biggest wildfire this year that has charred a section of Oregon half the size of Rhode Island."
environment,"“He always told me to stop and enjoy the moment,” Crouser said. “He knows for me, I’m always super goal-oriented and looking long term. His thing that he always told me was to stop and smell the roses.”"
environment,Catching fires more quickly gives firefighters a better chance of keeping them small.
environment,"There have been 730 more wildfires in California so far this year than last, an increase of about 16%. But nearly triple the area has burned — 470 square miles (1,200 square kilometers)."
environment,"That includes using new fire behavior computer modeling that can help assess risks before fires start, then project their path and growth."
environment,"When “critical weather” is predicted — hot, dry winds or lightning storms — the technology, on top of hard-earned experience, allows California planners to pre-position fire engines, bulldozers, aircraft and hand crews armed with shovels and chain saws in areas where they can respond more quickly."
environment,"That’s helped Cal Fire hold an average 95% of blazes to 10 acres (4 hectares) or less even in poor conditions driven by drought or climate change, she said. So far this year it’s held 96.5% of fires below 10 acres (4 hectares)."
environment,"With the computer modeling, “they can do a daily risk forecast across the state, so they use that for planning,” said Lynne Tolmachoff, spokeswoman for Cal Fire, California’s firefighting agency."
environment,"In another effort to catch fires quickly, what once were fire lookout towers staffed by humans have largely been replaced with cameras in remote areas, many of them in high-definition and armed with artificial intelligence to discern a smoke plume from morning fog. There are 800 such cameras scattered across California, Nevada and Oregon, and even casual viewers can remotely watch wildfires in real time."
environment,"Federal firefighters similarly track how dry vegetation has become in certain areas, then station crews and equipment ahead of lightning storms or in areas where people gather during holidays, said Stanton Florea, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman at the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho."
environment,"“Your job is to manage the fire, and these are tools that will help you do so” with a degree of accuracy unheard of even five years ago, said Char Miller, a professor at Pomona College in California and a widely recognized wildfire policy expert."
environment,"Fire managers can then “start making tactical decisions based on what they can see,” even before firefighters reach the scene, Tolmachoff said."
environment,"Other mapping software can show active fires, fuel breaks designed to slow their spread, prescribed burns, defensible space cleared around homes, destroyed homes and other wildfire damage."
environment,"“It’s all still new, but we can see where it’s going to take us in the future when it comes to planning for people building homes on the wildland area, but also wildland firefighting,” Tolmachoff said."
environment,"Fire managers also routinely summon military drones from the National Guard or Air Force to fly over fires at night, using heat imaging to map their boundaries and hot spots. They can use satellite imagery to plot the course of smoke and ash."
environment,"In California, fire managers can overlay all that information on high-quality Light Detection and Ranging topography maps that can aid decisions on forest management, infrastructure planning and preparation for wildfires, floods, tsunamis and landslides. Then they add the fire behavior computer simulation based on weather and other variables."
environment,"Some experts argue it’s a losing battle against wildfires worsened by global warming, a century of reflexive wildfire suppression and overgrown forests, and communities creeping into what once were sparsely populated areas. Climate change has made the West hotter and drier in the past 30 years, and scientists have long warned the weather will get more extreme as the world warms."
environment,"Cal Fire and other fire agencies have been early adopters of remote imaging and other technologies that can be key in early wildfire detection, said John Bailey, a former firefighter and now professor at Oregon State University."
environment,"Yet, firefighters’ goal is to replicate the outcome of a fire that started Monday in the canyon community of Topanga, between Los Angeles and Malibu."
environment,It had the potential to swiftly spread through dry brush but was held to about 7 acres (3 hectares) after water-dropping aircraft were scrambled within minutes from LA and neighboring Ventura County.
environment,"What firefighters don’t want is another wildfire like the one that ravaged the Malibu area in 2018. It destroyed more than 1,600 structures, killed three people and forced thousands to flee."
environment,"In another bid to gain an early advantage, California is buying a dozen new Sikorsky Firehawk helicopters — at $24 million each — that can operate at night, fly faster, drop more water and carry more firefighters than the Vietnam War-era Bell UH-1H “Hueys” they will eventually replace."
environment,"For all that, firefighters’ efforts to outsmart and suppress wildfires is counterproductive if all it does is postpone fires in areas that will eventually burn, argued Richard Minnich, a professor in Riverside who studies fire ecology."
environment,"It will also soon receive seven military surplus C-130 transport aircraft retrofitted to carry 4,000 gallons (15,140 litres) of fire retardant, more than three times as much as Cal Fire’s workhorse S-2 airtankers."
environment,"“No matter how sophisticated the technology may be, the areas they can manage or physically impact things is small,” he said. “We’re in over our heads. You can have all the technology in the world — fire control is impossible.”"
environment,"Working with wildfires is more realistic, he said, by taking advantage of patches that previously burned to channel the spread of new blazes."
environment,"Timothy Ingalsbee, a former federal firefighter who now heads Firefighters United for Safety, Ethics and Ecology, also said firefighters need to adopt a new approach when confronting the most dangerous wind-driven wildfires that leapfrog containment lines by showering flaming embers a mile or more ahead of the main inferno."
environment,"It’s better to build more fire-resistant homes and devote scarce resources to protecting threatened communities while letting the fires burn around them, he said."
environment,"Associated Press writers Keith Ridler in Boise, Idaho, and Christopher Weber in Los Angeles contributed to this story."
environment,"As of Wednesday morning, the massive blaze in southern Oregon ― currently the largest wildfire burning in the country ― has consumed nearly 400,000 acres, a 625 square-mile swath of land comparable in size to half of Rhode Island. Just 32% of the fire is contained."
environment,"“We have these amazing tools that allow us to map fire spread in real time and model it better than weather predictions,” Ingalsbee said. “Using that technology, we can start being more strategic and working with fire to keep people safe, keep homes safe, but let fire do the work it needs to do — which is recycle all the dead stuff into soil.”"
environment,"The Bootleg Fire in Oregon, which has ruined more than 150 structures and displaced thousands of people, is so big that officials say it may not be fully extinguished until November. "
environment,"The fire is so large that it’s spawning pyrocumulous clouds, super-heated columns of smoke and ash that can reach up to 6 miles high and generate their own lightning and strong winds. Those, in turn, can ignite and spread other fires, creating a destructive cycle."
environment,"“Normally, the weather predicts what the fire will do,” Oregon Department of Forestry spokesperson Marcus Kauffman told CNN on Tuesday. “In this case, the fire is predicting what the weather will do.”"
environment,"Fire officials said Wednesday that lightning or some other natural cause likely ignited the massive fire on July 6, which expanded aggressively thanks to a combination of gusty winds and critically dry fuel. An unprecedented heatwave in late June left 90% of the state in exceptional, extreme or severe drought conditions. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration concluded the heatwave would have been “virtually impossible” without climate change."
environment,"PNW Incident Management Commander Rob Allen warned Tuesday that the fight would be “a marathon, not a sprint.”"
environment,"“We’re in this for as long as it takes to safely confine this monster,” he said."
environment,"No one has died so far, according to The Associated Press. "
environment,"The fire may not be fully extinguished until widespread moisture falls over the area in late October or November, firefighting official Katy O’Hara told The Washington Post."
environment,"However, at least 70 homes and 100 outbuildings have so far been destroyed, with some 2,000 homes evacuated and another 5,000 threatened. (In slightly better news, firefighters confirmed to The Oregonian that a monument to the only U.S. mainland casualties from enemy action in World War II has survived.)"
environment,"“There’s absolutely no question that climate change is playing out before our eyes,” Oregon Gov. Kate Brown (D) said at a news conference Tuesday. “We saw the heat dome event a few weeks ago. We unfortunately lost a lot of Oregonians through that event. In February we saw devastating ice storms. Over a half a million people lost power last fall, as you are well aware. We had unprecedented wildfires.”"
environment,"Almost 80 large fires are currently burning across the American West. They have destroyed more than 1.3 million acres of land, a 2,031 square-mile area bigger than the state of Delaware. Smoke from those fires even darkened the skies of New York City — about 2,000 miles away — on Tuesday. "
environment,"“It’s incredibly important that we ... tackle climate change, from reducing our reliance on fossil fuels to making sure that we transition to clean energy as quickly as possible,” Brown added. "

environment,"Democrats plan to use their slim majorities in Congress to pass a $3.5 trillion spending package that includes mandates to cut 80% of planet-heating pollution from the electricity sector by 2030, fund a new green jobs corps, and make it easier for drivers to swap gas guzzlers for electric vehicles. "
environment,"This week, the Biden administration and its allies in Congress announced plans to pack the federal budget with resources and rules that could jolt a country long paralyzed by corporate obstruction and science denial into finally confronting an unprecedented crisis. "
environment,"Whether enough funding will make it into the final budget to make the programs significant remains unclear. By tacking the proposals to the budget process, which requires only 51 votes to become law, Democrats can circumvent the 60-vote threshold for passing traditional legislation that grants Republicans filibuster power. "
environment,"There’s pull on the other end of Democrats’ ideological spectrum, too, as 16 senators, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), have vowed to vote against any budget that excludes climate provisions. But, as Mother Jones reported, those in the “No Climate, No Deal” contingent have yet to settle on any uniform demands about what kinds of policy they want to see in the budget. "

Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) joined two Republicanas to introduce legislation to give grants to financially imperiled nuclear power plants in hopes of maintaining the supply of the country’s biggest source of carbon-free electricity."
environment,"But doing so gives Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), widely considered the most conservative Democrat in the caucus, kingmaker status, and already he’s signaled his opposition to anything that disadvantages fossil fuels. "
environment,"While negotiators hash out the budget, other lawmakers are proposing standalone legislation that could ultimately appear in the final funding bill."
environment,"“We cannot address a small sliver of our carbon pollution and call it a victory. We have to tackle this problem at scale,” Leah Stokes, an associate professor of political science at the University of California, Santa Barbara, and author of ”Short Circuiting Policy,” wrote in The Atlantic this week. “The last chance we had for a federal climate bill was 12 years ago. I’m afraid that Congress will again fail to pass climate legislation that invests at the necessary level. I’m worried that we’ll keep burning time we no longer have.”"
environment,"Progressives in the House of Representatives, meanwhile, are pitching their own vision for how to legislate on climate. "
environment,"In March, lawmakers announced the THRIVE Act, a $10 trillion spending plan, their banner policy.In April, Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) put forward a plan to give $1 trillion in federal aid to cities, towns and tribes seeking to slash emissions in a bid to circumvent anti-climate mandates on the state level.On Thursday, Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) proposed what he called the “Green New Deal for public schools,” a $1.4 trillion package to fund major retrofits at schools, hire more teachers and help kids living in poverty."
environment,The steeper price tags the left-leaning candidates are seeking may seem big. But the numbers are actually more in line with what economists on the left and right ― from the progressive Roosevelt Institute to George W. Bush-era Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ― say is needed to rapidly scale down the U.S. output of planet-heating gases. 
environment,"Yet President Joe Biden and his treasury chief, Janet Yellen, worry that borrowing more money to justify climate spending poses financial risks for the country, despite warnings from economists and forecasters that failing to invest enough now in decarbonization carries even bigger risks as warming worsens. Under those self-imposed restraints, the White House sought to offset all its infrastructure and climate spending with new taxes."
environment,"And while the Biden administration has faced mounting protests from climate activists demanding more action to curb emissions, pleas for something as wonky as “more deficit spending” have yet to materialize or gain popularity. "
environment,"Facing ferocious blowback from industries and their allies in Congress, the federal policymakers could only come up with $2.4 trillion in direct revenue to offset the program and managed to muster another $1.1 trillion through accounting techniques with the budget. "
environment,"Despite far stricter budget constraints due to its multinational euro currency, the European Union this week took some even more aggressive climate steps, proposing a dozen bills that would, among other things, ban diesel- and gas-powered cars by 2035 and levy new taxes on heating gas. "
environment,"Expanding on those efforts could prove crucial ahead of November’s United Nations climate conference in Scotland. The world is already 1.1 degrees Celsius hotter than in pre-industrial times, and even if every country adheres to its pledged emissions cuts, the planet would still be on pace to warm by at least another 2 degrees this century. Changing that trajectory depends not only on rich nations cutting emissions, but on poorer countries doing the same, and in many cases forswearing the development of heavily polluting industries that helped North America and Europe grow so wealthy. "
environment,"If the U.S. and European Union — home to the people most responsible for the accumulated carbon in the atmosphere today — can’t rapidly slash emissions, convincing the majority of humanity in Africa, Asia and Latin America to do the same will be a tough sell. "
environment,Utah’s shrinking Great Salt Lake could spell disaster for millions of birds that depend on the briny body of water for food.
environment,North America’s largest saltwater lake has been diminishing for years due to people redirecting its water for human use. Climate change-fueled drought ― including the extreme drought currently hammering the western United States ― has made it more severe.
environment,"The southern part of the lake is “just a couple inches above the historic low measurement taken in 1963,” according to a Friday statement from the U.S. Geological Survey. The agency said it anticipates the water will continue to drop over the next several months."
environment,"A comprehensive history of the lake from The Deseret News earlier this year noted that while the size of the lake has “always fluctuated,” an 11-foot drop in water levels ― which is a lot for the wide lake’s relatively shallow lake bed ― has occurred mostly over the last 10 years."
environment,"“Twenty years ago, this was under about 10 feet of water,” Kevin Perry, chairman of the department of atmospheric sciences at the University of Utah, told CNN. As he said that, he was riding a bike across the dry lake bed."
environment,"The lake is an important food source for an estimated 10 million migrating birds, according to a statement this week from the Utah Geological Survey. Those birds eat the lake’s brine shrimp and brine flies that, in turn, feed off of underwater reeflike rock mounds, called microbialites, that are created by microbes."
environment,"Receding water levels can expose the microbialites and threaten the lake’s entire ecosystem, the UGS warned. In the coming months, “a very significant proportion” are expected to be exposed, according to the agency."
environment,"The brine shrimp also play an important economic role for people, who harvest the creatures and sell them as fish food."
environment,"The lake is also an essential breeding habitat for pelicans. Dipping water levels have resulted in new land bridges being exposed between the mainland and the island where the birds nest, The Associated Press reported. Larger animals like foxes and coyotes can then cross to the island, which scares pelican parents away. The eggs and young are then vulnerable to being preyed on by seagulls."
environment,"Human health is also at risk. The lake bed soil is high in arsenic, and when water recedes and the ground dries out, wind blows that dust into the air. While the lake bed has a protective crust that prevents a lot of dust from getting into the area, that crust is getting damaged as people walk and even drive vehicles on it."
environment,Wildlife biologist Jaimi Butler told CNN that thinking about keeping water in the Great Salt Lake is the “biggest thing” that keeps her up at night.
environment,"“The more continued drought we have, the more of the salt crust will be weathered and more dust will become airborne because there’s less of that protective crust layer,” Laura Vernon of Friends of the Great Salt Lake told the AP."

environment,"The charges included one felony count of involuntary manslaughter, along with other felony and misdemeanor counts related to the fire."
environment,"The El Dorado Fire erupted on Sept. 5 when the couple and their young children staged a baby gender reveal at El Dorado Ranch Park in Yucaipa, at the foot of the San Bernardino Mountains."
environment,"Strong winds stoked the fire as it ran through wilderness on national forest land, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) east of Los Angeles."
environment,"A smoke-generating pyrotechnic device was set off in a field and quickly ignited dry grass on a scorching day. The couple frantically tried to use bottled water to douse the flames and called 911, authorities said."

environment,Extremely dry conditions and heat waves tied to climate change have made wildfires harder to fight. Climate change has made the West much warmer and drier in the past 30 years and will continue to make weather more extreme and wildfires more frequent and destructive.
environment,The blaze injured 13 other people and forced the evacuations of hundreds of residents in small communities in the San Bernardino National Forest area. It destroyed five homes and 15 other buildings.
environment,"Because drugs, especially psychedelics, have never been my jam. Sure, I’ve passed around a sketchily-sourced joint on the deck outside a high school party. I was also quick to disappear without goodbyes, wandering down the street back home — my brain at 17 already overactive enough not to need my teenaged paranoias exaggerated."
environment,"So why now? Why, at 44, am I regularly waking up and taking a mid-morning nibble off a stem of Psilocybe cyanescens? My first impulse is to blame Michael Pollan and his book “How To Change Your Mind,” because only a science nerd could have led me to the dark side. But if I’m being honest, the “dark side” was always my favorite side, and it’s just taken me 44 years to come to terms with that."
environment,"Dark, I’d argue, gets an undeserved bad rap. I would go so far as to argue that human society is obsessed, even, with some real bullshit positive psychology — but that’s another essay. When I say “dark side” I mean, for example, the dreams into which we venture every night and then entirely neglect by the light of day. I mean the night sky in which we occupy a single planet of eight around a sun, belonging to a solar system beyond which there might be — according to astronomers — billions of worlds. I am talking about the undiscussed darkness of our impossible existence — and why."
environment,The blaze blackened nearly 36 square miles (92 square kilometers) of land in San Bernardino and Riverside counties before it was contained on Nov. 16.
environment,"The fire was one of thousands during a record-breaking wildfire season in California that charred more than 4% of the state while destroying nearly 10,500 buildings and killing 33 people."
environment,The couple were released on their own recognizance pending a Sept. 15 court date.
environment,"How, exactly, does a modern mom, between work and carpools and book clubs, get her hands on magic mushrooms? That’s an interesting question, but there’s a more important one before it: Where does a modern mother get the idea she wants to get her hands on magic mushrooms?"
environment,"It’s not the ’60s and I’m not a hippie. Neither am I in my experimental teens or 20s. Yet here I am: a mom on mushrooms. Not the cremini I put in my morning omelette or the dried shiitakes I rehydrate in warm water before adding to fresh ramen, but exactly the kind of mushrooms we all know as “magic.”"
environment,Not that it isn’t our first instinct to ask these questions. I field them every day from my children:
environment,"And there were those repeated late ’80s “Public Service Announcements” on TV with that guy with the rolled-up sleeves and bad-cop act, holding a hot cast iron pan, cracking an egg with one hand like a head on cement, leaving viewers with a death stare and the hot snap and sizzle of “your brains on drugs.” I was a rule-follower by nature, and these images left their impressions."
environment,"These questions seem, to me, the most important in our one-of-billions world, and yet I cannot figure out why my 5- and 8-year old children are the only people I know entertaining them. Except that we are always in a rush, and I am just as guilty of pushing these questions aside."
environment,"“Mom, who had the very first baby?” my daughter asks."
environment,"Slowing down might be the very point of my magic mushroom stem-nibbling. And let me be clear, I’m pretty sure “nibbling stems” is a very unprofessional methodology. I started hearing about microdosing, or taking very small doses of a drug or substance, around the same time psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) became decriminalized around Colorado and legalized in Oregon."
environment,"“Mom, what do YOU think God is?” they inquire as they roll their forks in spaghetti on the kitchen island."
environment,"Now, if you are one of those people who pulls over their car when my 8-year-old walks the six blocks between my husband’s office and our house to ask, “Where is your mother?!” then let me assure you, I am not actually tripping on these mushrooms. And though the noticeable immediate effect is for me less than a cup of caffeinated coffee (which I do not drink because it makes me shaky and sleepless), I reserve my nibbles for the slow days after the kids have left for school, when I have hours to drop into my writing (which I feel the psilocybin serves)."
environment,"The goal of microdosing, after all, is not to trip. It’s difficult to define either the exact effects or goals of microdosing psilocybin because the science is still in progress. Researchers have taken up the task only in the last 10 years, and the results aren’t all in."
environment,"I have friends on both ends of therapy (treating and receiving) who chatter excitedly about the early trials showing psilocybin’s symptom relief for depression and anxiety. I’ve even heard of a local girl who does things “properly.” She encapsulates the mushrooms according to precise calculations with precise devices and then organizes very-gentle “guided experiences” for novice experimenters like me. But as I have worked as an experiential education guide for over 16 years, I am entirely sick of guided experiences. So I continue to nibble the psilocybin in my own soft rebellion."
environment,"“Mom, what happens when you die?” my son wants to know."
environment,"Because these questions require me to stop chopping carrots and stop feeding the dog and stop looking at my phone for texts from my husband as to when he’s coming home. These questions require a blanket and a couch or maybe a hammock or a sleeping bag under a night sky. These questions require the extension, trust, and embrace of my full imagination. My quickest cop-out with the kids? “No one really knows love.” And then I keep on chopping carrots."
environment,"A microdosage is generally considered “subtherapeutic,” with no adverse side effects. But anecdotal accounts are showing there may be a cellular response that affects mood and health in similar ways as larger dosages (for which there is plenty of science with startling results). But in my entire psilocybin career, including the last six months I have been regularly microdosing, I have experienced no hallucinogenic effects. (Not yet anyway. Because a macrodose is, in fact, my long-term plan.) But if I have learned anything in my 44 years, it’s to slow down."
environment,"So what is my goal? My goal was inspired by the subtitle in Chapter 6 of Pollan’s book, “Dying.”"
environment,"Under this title, Pollan writes about cancer patients who use psilocybin (in hallucinogenic dosages) to psychedelically approach impending death. And according to preliminary studies, it works: “In both the NYU and Hopkins trials, some 80% of cancer patients showed clinically significant reductions in standard measures of anxiety and depression.”"
environment,"So here’s what I’m wondering: If cancer patients can make peace with their own deaths, can I approach my existential distress about the impending sixth mass extinction on Earth in a similar way? What would happen if I could look deeply into the eyes of my own extinction? Is there a realm where I can make some peace with the quality and quantity of the human years my children and their descendants face in the oncoming climate crisis?"
environment,"If you do not have a child, please imagine for a minute going to bed with this elephant weight on your chest each night. Because this is how it is for me every night: I tuck my daughter in and she closes her eyes and smiles because she thinks she knows peace. And with her eyes closed, with the blankets pulled up to her chin, I think: What have I done. What have we done? This future coming at her... and I don’t know if it’s worth living."
environment,"I don’t know where my daughter’s instinct to become a mother came from (because it was not mine as a child), but she repeatedly says that of all the things she hopes for her future, she wants “to be a mama.” How and when will I tell her the Earth is not stable and already overtasked by the number of humans that live it on it?"
environment,"And then there are the tremors she feels through me. The shift of Colorado weather to “new normal” permanent drought. The tenuous future of the avocados and raspberries that she favors, threatened by hive collapses of the bees that pollinate the fruits. Her mother’s tears for the songbirds that fell out of the sky in their migration south last fall. Yellow warblers and violet-green swallows and flycatchers with bold wing bars that fell dead in starvation by the thousands. They fell in Arizona after their flight across Colorado skies. My daughter’s skies."
environment,"My current microdosing method is to pull off a mushroom, after asking for permission from the fungus, of course (because I was born with that bit of hippie-ness), and nibble the stalk. I like to think we — me and the little forest — have already established a kinship because I love their smell like the pheromones of a first crush: woody with a touch of sweetness and a powdery nuance. I remember kids in high school choking their mushrooms down or cringing over infused mushroom tea, but that has not been my experience. Maybe it is my adult palette or my adult intentions, but I savor my nibbles."
environment,"I recently received my newest batch of mushrooms from a trusted friend of a trusted friend who grows them for therapeutic purposes in Oregon. My husband wanted to crush and encapsulate the cluster, but I would not let him touch them. It’s literally a family of mushrooms: An impossibly large grandmother mushroom three inches in height with her wavy umbrella cap reaching over and protecting 13 or more smaller stems and caps, all of varying heights and bendy stems. This family of stalks shares a porous root system — which I am unsure is even edible."
environment,"I begin with my incisors, pass the little morsel around my mouth, grind it with my molars to take in the deeper flavors on the back of my tongue, and swallow. Then I go about my day. The effect, for me, is so subtle I often forget my nibble entirely except ― except ― when I notice a shimmer in the tall bluestem grasses laced with snow on my hike. Or suddenly hear, at once, all the calls of wintering birds across my path. Or catch myself watching a black-capped chickadee hopping from branch to branch of a blue spruce for five minutes before I snap from the spell. Or notice a pattern or swirl in my prose that I wonder if I’d have seen otherwise."
environment,"It’s those new paths I’m after. A rite of passage. Not a rite that folds me further into human culture, but a passage that folds me into nature. A sacrament. A spiritually significant experience — the way Indigenous peoples of Central American and Mexico have been using psilocybin for centuries."
environment,"When these little things sparkle at me, I’m not hallucinating. I’m just seeing the world. And I suspect the insights, the new neural pathways forming in my brain, are also healing me out of some anxiety ruts."
environment,I know she feels the peace shifting. She felt a tremor in the plumes of black smoke from wildfires she watched burn from the roof of our house last fall. She felt tremors in the cancellation of her 5th birthday because of a global pandemic that has killed 3.8 million and counting.
environment,"I’m not advocating drugs, per se. “Do not do them,” I say (with my sleeves rolled up), if that needs to be said. What I’m advocating is a seismic shift in what we hold meaningful, a conscious exploration of the dark that surrounds us, and an embrace of anything that gets us closer to our nature as nature."
environment,"I have, in my study of psilocybin, learned many new words. Other names for psychedelics include entactogen (“touching within”), empathogen (“generating a state of empathy”), and my favorite: entheogen (”that which causes God to be experienced”). I do not think psilocybin is the only method to achieve these effects, but I do think our neural ruts, chafed by lifetimes of capitalistic conditioning, are in need of a seismic shake. "
environment,"Dr. Robin Carthart-Harris, head of the psychedelic research group at Imperial College London, likened the effects of psychedelics on the brain to shaking a snow globe: “you shake it and there’s disorder there. But then the snow will settle again.” He explains that a brain that has fallen into pathological patterns can benefit from reorganization."
environment,"One NYU study volunteer said of her psychedelic experience, “It is like I know another language,” and I have a feeling that as a species out of touch, out of empathetic connection, out of mystical alignment with all other species on this planet — that a new language might be exactly what we need."
environment,Jung’s afternoon light feels collectively upon us right now.
environment,"I would argue that the search for meaning is even more essential, more expedited in pressing need, in the face of the impending ecological death we will witness in the next five, 10, 20, 50 years. Jung went further and concluded that we are meant to do things in the last half of life for ourselves, for society, for the sake of our souls."
environment,"Since I’ve begun nibbling, the highest frequencies of my existential fears have subsided. And though I do not know if this is normal, I often, in the day after a nibble, experience the briefest flash of alignment. In that second, I do not feel sad or overwhelmed or angry or alone or impossible. In that second, I am at once forgiver and forgiven. The flash ― it’s gone as quick as it came. But it leaves a faint footprint — like a snowshoe hare on snow."
environment,"Carl Jung wrote, “The afternoon of life is just as full of meaning as the morning.” I read in this that the search for meaning is important when we are young and accumulating experience, but just as ripe, as necessary and needed, when we are older. "
environment,"As the kids opened the door to leave for school today, I noticed the entire world shimmering behind them. I was not under the influence of any psilocybin. It was this rare occurrence I hypothesize happens more in Colorado than anywhere else because it was sunny and snowing. The sky was that shock of blue that happens only in dry high altitude where nothing muddles color or distance. And yet, it was snowing. Large flakes, blowing, I suspected, from some black sheep cloud maybe hiding behind the house. I went out on the deck, stood under the falling cubic crystals, and looked for the cloud, but could find no source. "
environment,"The effect of snowflakes in sunshine, if you have not seen it, is something to behold. Imagine every angle of an ice crystal reflecting that blazing largest star in our solar system. And then multiply it by billions. The effect is dazzling. I went inside and steeped my tea without taking my eyes off the window, and then I sat and I watched. "
environment,"It felt like the first time I had sat down since becoming a mother. And it made me wonder if I could, in fact, hold it all. Light and dark, grief and gratitude, sun and snow. I came up with no answer. I just wondered."

environment,"Authorities in the German state of Rhineland-Palatinate said 60 people had died there, including at least nine residents of an assisted living facility for people with disabilities. In neighboring North Rhine-Westphalia state officials put the death toll at 43, but warned that the figure could rise further."
environment,"“We managed to get 50 people out of their houses last night,” said Frank Rock, the head of the county administration. “We know of 15 people who still need to be rescued.”"

environment,"New analysis of campaign disclosures found the six Democratic senators ― Mark Kelly (Ariz.), Maggie Hassan (N.H.), Joe Manchin (W.Va.), Chris Coons (Del.), Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) and Jon Tester (Mont.) ― received a combined total of nearly $333,000 from lobbyists, political action committees and lobbying firms affiliated with Exxon over the past decade."
environment,Exxon Mobil Corp. lobbyist Keith McCoy listed six Democrats the oil giant saw as key allies to push its legislative agenda in the Senate in a secretly recorded sting video Greenpeace UK published late last month.
environment,"But Collin Rees, the senior campaigner at Oil Change U.S. who conducted the analysis, said the donations paint a fuller picture of Exxon Mobil’s influence taking stock of the relationships the company’s money helped cultivate as well as those that may have prompted the oil giant to hire certain lobbyists in the first place."
environment,"Surprisingly, there’s nothing fishy about the practice. Aerial fish stocking has been used in the Beehive State since the mid-1950s, according to the agency’s post. It is also used to repopulate species, because fish don’t reproduce naturally in many of Utah’s lakes. The “planes are just the most efficient way to provide fish for anglers,” Chris Penne, a regional aquatic manager for the wildlife division, told the Times."
environment,"A viral video released by the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources this month shows one of the agency’s planes flying over a lake by Utah’s Boulder Mountain on July 6. Suddenly, the plane’s hatch opens and out tumble thousands of young brook trout and tiger trout (called fingerlings, per The New York Times) in a torrent of water. The creatures twist and turn and flop about until they disappear under the lake’s surface. The airplane holds hundreds of pounds of water and can drop 35,000 fish in a single flight without reloading, according to a Facebook postby the agency."
environment,"“The fish are between 1-3 inches long, so they flutter down slowly to the water,” the agency said on Facebook."
environment,"The analysis of campaign disclosures, which the advocacy group Oil Change U.S. conducted and HuffPost reviewed, found Tester received the most in donations from Exxon Mobil ― $99,783 from seven lobbyists, the company’s PAC and four lobbying firms working for the firm. "
environment,"The agency stocked around 200 high-elevation lakes across the state using this extreme and “effective” fish drop method, per the Facebook post. It is used because many of the lakes in the state are not accessible by vehicle."
environment,The report includes some donations lobbyists at K Street behemoths such as Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld and Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck gave before taking on Exxon Mobil as a client. Spokespeople for Coons and Sinema said including those contributions in the total was “misleading” and “inaccurate.”
environment,"“This is a story about how lobbyists curry favor, and specifically about how Exxon’s current lobbyists have spent decades currying the favor of these six Democrats to position themselves to do things like safeguard fossil fuel subsidies and pare down infrastructure packages,” Rees said. “Exxon has hired these firms and lobbyists because they’ve contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to these Democrats, both before and after they were hired by Exxon.” "
environment,"Counting donations from lobbyists like Arshi Siddiqui, some of which came before Exxon Mobil hired her, makes Sinema the No. 2 recipient on the list, with $70,800 in contributions from eight Exxon Mobil lobbyists, the company PAC and three lobbying firms. "
environment,It’s unclear whether a meeting with Exxon Mobil chief Darren Woods took place. 
environment,"“Inclusion of those contributions would be incredibly misleading,” John LaBombard, a spokesman for Sinema, said of money that came from lobbyists who also work for other clients. “Kyrsten’s work in the Senate is influenced by only one thing: what is best for Arizona.”"
environment,"“One of the other ones that aren’t talked about is Senator Coons, who’s from Delaware, who has a very close relationship with Senator Biden,” McCoy said in the now-viral video, in which he believed he was talking to corporate headhunters in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. “So we’ve been working with his office. As a matter of fact, our CEO is talking to him next Tuesday.”"
environment,"“On the Democrat side, we look for the moderates,” McCoy said. “So it’s the Manchins. It’s the Sinemas. It’s the Testers.”"
environment,"Coons came in third with $68,650 from seven lobbyists, the PAC and four lobbying firms. "
environment,"“That’s Hassan,” he said. “That’s Kelly.” "
environment,"Beyond seeking out right-leaning senators, McCoy said the company looked for “who’s up for reelection in 2022?”"
environment,"A spokesman for Kelly said: “Senator Kelly has not met with the individual in the original Exxon video, and hasn’t spoken with anyone from this company in the Senate. Senator Kelly also does not accept corporate PAC contributions to his campaign.”"
environment,A spokeswoman for Hassan pointed to the senator’s 98% voting score from the League of Conservation Voters and noted that “the video only says that Senator Hassan is up for re-election ... it isn’t for her support of their policies but simply because she is up for re-election.”
environment,"Manchin, meanwhile, received the fourth-most donations, at $64,864, followed by Hassan at $26,699. Kelly, who took office last December and declined all corporate PAC money, accepted just $1,500, which came from two Exxon-registered lobbyists. "
environment,"In the video, McCoy said Exxon Mobil is “playing defense” as the Biden administration and its slim Democratic majority in Congress seek to enact the country’s most significant climate legislation ever, including voting on an infrastructure package with billions of dollars for clean energy and electric vehicles as well as looking to pass a 100% clean electricity standard through budget reconciliation. "
environment,Tester’s office did not provide a comment. 
environment,Exxon Mobil said it “complies with all federal and state regulations and lobbying laws.”
environment,"“We have a responsibility to our customers, employees, communities and shareholders to represent their interests in public policy discussions that impact our business,” said Todd Spitler, an Exxon Mobil spokesman. He said McCoy’s remarks “do not represent the company’s position on a variety of issues, including comments regarding interactions with elected officials.” "
environment,"But influence peddling is nothing new for the $258 billion company, which served as one of the chief financiers of a network of climate denial think tanks throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Today, Exxon Mobil funds trade associations that lobby against climate policies while offering a rhetorical contrast to oil giants that advocate for politically unpopular proposals unlikely to reach fruition in a bid to look like responsible actors. "
environment,"Donations don’t necessarily equal political clout. Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), one of the lead champions of ending fossil fuel use, previously accepted campaign contributions from lobbyists linked to Exxon Mobil. He returned them in 2019, but the incident highlighted just how tightly woven oil companies are into the fabric of American politics and, as a result, how difficult it can be to avoid threads that ultimately lead back to the fossil fuel industry. "
environment,"But a 2017 Ohio State University study indicates the donations have a measurable effect, particularly as they enter the five-figure range. For every $10,000 a lawmaker received from a major industrial polluter like Exxon Mobil, their probability of voting for pro-environmental legislation decreased by 2%, according to the study of donations between 1990 and 2010 published in the journal Environmental Politics. For Democrats, the effect of the donations was even stronger, reducing likelihood of a pro-environmental vote by 3%. "
environment,"The push comes amid cascading climate disasters ― from deadly heat waves on one coast to historic flooding on the other ― that scientists say will grow worse and more frequent if fossil fuel use continues unabated. Even the International Energy Agency, hardly a tree-hugging institution, projects that averting catastrophic warming means “from today, no investment in new fossil fuel supply projects.” "
environment,"Virginia Canter, the chief ethics counsel at the watchdog Citizens For Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said corporate lobbyists “expect something in return” when they make political donations. "
environment,"Regardless of whether it swings votes, firms like Exxon Mobil give “money to secure access to politicians,” said Tyson Slocum, the energy program director at the anti-corruption group Public Citizen. "
environment,"“As a result, when Exxon’s lobbyists, PACs and lobbying firms make donations to particular senators, we have to ask ourselves what do they expect and what did they get in return,” said Canter, a former ethics counsel for the Obama and Clinton administrations. "
environment,"“While securing access doesn’t guarantee results, it ensures the company can influence the thinking and positions taken by the politician receiving the money,” Slocum said, noting that he condemned Greenpeace UK’s “deceptive tactics” to dupe McCoy. “And the result shows that Exxon does indeed appear to influence these and other elected officials to which it contributes.”"
environment,"If Exxon Mobil’s use of PFAS were more widely known, McCoy said in one part of the video, environmentalists would likely “start talking about how this is an Exxon Mobil chemical and Exxon Mobil is poisoning our waterways.”"
environment,"The sting video has prompted new scrutiny of Exxon Mobil beyond its campaign contributions. The New Republic examined the company’s routine six-figure donations to centrist think tanks such as the Brookings Institution. On Monday, the advocacy group Physicians for Social Responsibility published a new report indicating that the oil giant uses so-called forever chemicals ― a family of cancer-causing water contaminants known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS ― to drill at roughly 1,200 wells across six U.S. states."
environment,"But vast majorities of voters across party lines want the federal government to help them buy and install electric stoves, heaters and other appliances that would reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and eliminate emissions. "
environment,Few U.S. voters realize the gas and oil used to power their homes and appliances spew huge amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. 
environment,"Once the public accepts that framing of reality, he said, “the debate is pretty much over.” "
environment,"That’s according to a new survey of 1,264 likely voters from the polling group Data for Progress and the advocacy nonprofit Rewiring America. "
environment,"The findings, from a national poll taken between July 7-9, could buoy support for the new legislation Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) is set to introduce Thursday that would add rebates for new energy-efficient or zero-carbon appliances and heating systems into the federal spending legislation lawmakers are currently negotiating. "
environment,"In reality, that number is closer to 37%, according to data from Rewiring America, a nonprofit founded by a MacArthur “genius” who conducted the first total accounting of all U.S. energy use and emissions. To keep global warming from reaching catastrophic levels, countries, especially rich ones like the U.S., need to rapidly eliminate fossil fuel use ― and that means electrifying virtually every home and automobile. "
environment,"Just 15% of those surveyed estimated that household energy usage produced “a lot” of emissions, with most estimating that decisions made around the proverbial dinner table ― about what car to drive, what stove to buy, and what kind of furnace to heat the water in the shower ― affect, at most, only 20% of the country’s climate-changing pollution. "
environment,"Considering that most people replace equipment in their homes only when it breaks down, roughly every 15 years or so, that mass electrification will likely depend on policies to make efficient, carbon-free appliances the obvious choice over fossil-fueled ones. "
environment,"“The water heater in your basement is going to conk out at some point. When it does, let’s make sure you get the efficient, electric one, because when you do that, you’ve locked in the zero-emissions pathway strategy in your house for the next 15 years,” he added. “Conversely, if you buy the fossil fuel replacement, you lock in that replacement for 15 years.” "
environment,"“We will not solve the climate crisis unless we electrify all the households in the U.S.,” said Ari Matusiak, the chief executive of Rewiring America. "
environment,"The survey suggested American voters, despite the knowledge gap about household pollution, support policies that make the zero-emissions pathway preferable. "
environment,"Just 24% of voters supported rebates for gas appliances, compared to 65% who said they’d prefer the government to offer cost-cutting kickbacks for electric versions, including 72% of Democrats, 65% of independents and 56% of Republicans. "
environment,"When asked if they’d participate in the program, either as homeowners or renters requesting landlords take part, 64% of voters said yes, including 76% of Democrats, 59% of independents, and 54% of Republicans. "
environment,"Asked whether they’d support “a new bill to make it easier and more affordable to purchase electric appliances” through “rebates for the purchase and installation of zero-emission and energy-efficient appliances, 71% of voters said they’d back the legislation. Posed that way, the proposition was even more popular, with 83% support from Democrats, 68% from independents, and 60% from Republicans. "
environment,"Another 51% of voters “strongly agreed” that the federal government should count homes, “including rental units, as part of our nation’s infrastructure when making decisions about new federal investments in infrastructure.” The issue appeared more polarized along partisan lines, with 68% of Democrats in support compared to 41% of independents and 39% of Republicans, though nearly one-fifth of voters in each category responded to that question by stating they “don’t know.” "
environment,"“If we do this right, and we make the right investments to catalyze this market transformation, it will be the thing people decide to do as a matter of course,” Matusiak said. “It will not be an ideological decision, where there are red-state furnaces and blue-state furnaces.” "
environment,"A growing number of cities where Democrats hold power, including San Francisco and Seattle, have banned new buildings from hooking up to gas lines, forcing developers to electrify the structures. But more than a dozen states Republicans control have considered or passed laws to ban such bans."
environment,The fight over emissions from buildings has grown increasingly partisan as industry groups reluctant to cut pollution tighten their grip on the building code rule-making process at the state level. 
environment,"Meanwhile, the private consortium that sets model building codes adopted in all 50 states recently gave gas utilities more power over the next round of energy-efficiency rules, set to come into effect in 2024. Real estate developers’ opposition to electrifying new homes tends to be rooted in concerns over the cost of non-gas appliances. "

You can’t automate or offshore the insulation or furnace installation.” "
environment,"“In the mid-2030s, every U.S. coast will experience rapidly increasing high-tide floods, when a lunar cycle will amplify rising sea levels caused by climate change,” NASA warned in a new report. "
environment,Just one region may escape the threat ― for now. 
environment,"“Only far northern coastlines, including Alaska’s, will be spared for another decade or longer because these land areas are rising due to long-term geological processes,” NASA said. "
environment,"When it wobbles one way, the high tides are lower. When it wobbles the other, however, the high tides are even higher, which could be especially destructive as sea levels rise. "
environment,"“We’re going to have sort of a double-whammy,” National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration oceanographer William Sweet, one of the study’s authors, told The Washington Post. “It means that coastal communities — unless they adapt and fortify — are likely to expect even greater flooding than they might otherwise.”"
environment,"“We’re getting closer and closer to the flooding thresholds or tipping point in these coastal locations,” NASA Sea Level Change Team leader Ben Hamlington told NPR. “The same variability in the past that didn’t cause flooding is now going to cause flooding.”"
environment,"There could even be “clusters” of floods, sometimes lasting a month or more, NASA said. "
environment,"NOAA reported 600 floods caused by high tides along the East Coast and Gulf Coast in 2019 alone. The coming wobble could worsen that, leading to “dramatic increases in flood numbers” in coastal cities around the nation."
environment,"Tidal floods involve less water than those caused by major weather events, such as storms, and are often taken less seriously as a result. "
environment,"“But if it floods 10 or 15 times a month, a business can’t keep operating with its parking lot underwater,” Phil Thompson, an assistant professor at the University of Hawaii and the lead author of the new study, said in a news release. “People lose their jobs because they can’t get to work. Seeping cesspools become a public health issue.”"
environment,"Thank the moon’s 18.6-year “wobble” cycle, which has been observed for some 300 years."
environment,"In response, NASA has created a “Sea Level Portal” to project what could happen in the future, which includes tools to anticipate flooding."
environment,"As a record-breaking heat wave gripped Oregon in late June, a diner at a Red Robin burger joint sent an urgent message to the state’s OSHA office: Every worker in the restaurant appeared to be in danger."
environment,The customer said it was 100 degrees inside the dining area and apparently even hotter in the kitchen.
environment,"“Hot air is pumping out of the vents like the heater is on,” the customer wrote the day after their visit. “I asked my server to move me but she explained that the AC units are not working properly and the owners will not fix them.”"
environment,"The records offer a frightening glimpse of the dangers workers across the country will face as heat waves become more frequent and extreme due to global warming. The conditions can be even more hazardous in mild climates like Oregon, where many workplaces aren’t necessarily outfitted for high heat."
environment,"The heat-related safety complaint was one of more than 100 that Oregon OSHA received during the last week of June, all of which HuffPost obtained through a public records request. The complaints reveal workers around the state feared for their lives as they clocked in amid temperatures as high as 116 degrees, often without sufficient breaks, water or air conditioning. The complaints came from workplaces of all kinds: restaurants, retail stores, car washes, warehouses, construction sites and manufacturing facilities. "
environment,Dozens complained of busted air conditioning units that employers hadn’t fixed. Many said they were required to continue working even when it felt unsafe. Some said they were reprimanded for taking unauthorized breaks in cooler areas of their worksites. 
environment,"The names of complainants were redacted. Although anyone can submit a complaint to OSHA, most appear to have come from employees as opposed to members of the public. In most cases, investigators would not have determined yet whether an employer violated the law."
environment,"“My server told me they were still forced to go to work and the only [extra] compensation they got was Gatorades,” the customer wrote to state Occupational Safety and Health regulators. “This is extremely hazardous.” "
environment,"The hazards were so prevalent that on July 8 Oregon OSHA implemented an emergency heat rule requiring employers to provide access to water, shade and adequate breaks during severe weather, as well as training on heat stress. The state is working on crafting a permanent rule."
environment,"
‘The AC System Is Broken’"
environment,"The fast-food industry drew a large share of the complaints. Pleas for help poured in from McDonald’s, Burger King, Pizza Hut, Little Caesars, Jack in the Box, Carl’s Jr., Subway and Chipotle locations. Again and again, restaurant workers said they were forced to work in scorching-hot kitchens without adequate air conditioning, according to the hazard descriptions in the complaints. "
environment,Extremely hot inside. Employees are being made to work near ovens and wearing masks without air-conditioning working inside the building. It’s extremely dangerous. No modifications are being made to mitigate the high potential for the heat exhaustion.
environment,From another Burger King:
environment,From a Pizza Hut:
environment,"Employees are working in 100 degree or higher heat with no air conditioner in a hot humidity kitchen for two years. In the past, employees have fainted from working in this kind of heat and employees can’t call out if they feel they aren’t able to work."
environment,Thermostat for AC not working and had requested to have this fixed previously and management did not address it.
environment,From a Chipotle:
environment,"110+ Degrees in the kitchen over the past few days. The AC system is broken and the employer will not fix it. This is when it’s been 101+ outside. Employees are forced to work nonetheless, no matter the heat hazard."
environment,"The air conditioning is not working. Employees are exposed to extreme heat conditions and have been experiencing heat related illness symptoms. The business does not have fans, employees are not given extra breaks or a cool place to rest."

environment,From a Burger King:
environment,"The restaurant management is forcing employees to work without air-conditioning in dangerous heat. The temperature in the building is at least 100*F. Employees are covered in sweat, and are showing signs of heat exhaustion."
environment,A Locked Refrigerator Refuge
environment,Plenty of workers wondered why their restaurants were still open while they seemed so ill-equipped to handle such weather. One complaint alleged that management at a pub in Wilsonville threatened to fire anyone who left because of the heat. The complaint claimed the temperature was above 90 degrees in the dining area and above 110 degrees in the kitchen: “They eventually closed but not until someone from the public complained and threatened to make a complaint.”
environment,"One complaint alleged that there was no air conditioning inside a Portland restaurant, leading to temperatures above 90 degrees. Workers ended up retreating to the walk-in refrigerator for relief."
environment,"“But the manager locked the door to keep employees from using the only way that was available for them to cool off,” the complaint states."
environment,"Workers at another Portland restaurant apparently pleaded with managers to close, to no avail: “Many employees almost passed out, and begged the management to close the restaurant, but they were told that the company doesn’t want to lose money.”"
environment,"One worker said a temperature of 95 degrees was recorded near the fryer inside a doughnut shop in Portland, even though the air conditioning was running: “Some employees reported feeling ill from the heat. Symptoms included headache, nausea, bloody nose, and feeling foggy.”"
environment,"At a Eugene restaurant, a complainant reported that “the entire kitchen staff (10-15 people) are feeling ill and exhausted from multiple days working in these extremely hot conditions.”"

environment,‘Employees Are Said To Be Passing Out’
environment,“No fans inside the greenhouse. The employer is not providing a place for employees to cool down. The employees asked management if they could come in early so they could leave early to avoid the heat and were denied.”
environment,"That’s much cooler than the conditions detailed at a greenhouse in McMinnville. A complaint alleged it was 20 degrees hotter inside the greenhouse than outside, and that workers weren’t getting enough breaks:"
environment,"Someone from a cannabis dispensary said it was 104 degrees inside their facility. “No air conditioning in a black building,” the complaint reads."
environment,"A complaint against a car wash in Scappoose alleged that one worker ended up sick with heat exhaustion. “The employer did not respond to employees who tried to bring this problem to his attention,” the complaint reads."
environment,Multiple complaints were filed against a canvassing agency that raises funds for nonprofits. The complaints said workers were going door-to-door or soliciting on the street with little access to shade. It’s not clear if all the complaints came from the same person.
environment,"“Canvasser looked exhausted and chapped and had ran out of drinking water and did not know where to get more,” one stated. “The canvasser did not know how to identify the signs of heat stroke.”"
environment,"Someone reported to OSHA that dancers at a Portland gay club were “prone to heat exhaustion, dehydration, and potentially heatstroke” in the poorly ventilated basement where they got changed."
environment,"A complaint against a warehouse said that workers were struggling to carry out basic tasks, and that the facility was too large for workers to easily step outside for fresh air: “Employees are said to be passing out and dropping things due to the heat.” A complaint against another warehouse said only the break room had air conditioning, but when workers tried to take advantage of it, “they are being reprimanded by the manager.”"
environment,"As if the record-breaking temperatures weren’t enough, some workers were apparently concerned about another byproduct of climate change: increased wildfires. One complaint alleged that roofing and sheet metal workers on a job site in Klamath Falls were working in triple-digit heat while the Tennant and Lava fires burned over the state line in California. They were worried about poor air quality on top of heat stress."
environment,"Factories and warehouses also turned up frequently in the files. One complainant said a worker at a Portland food manufacturer fainted due to heat exhaustion. The air conditioning was inadequate, they wrote, especially near the ovens: “Temperatures can be 10 to 20 degrees warmer on [the] floor than outside.” "
environment,"“Little to no shade and no breaks for a long period of time,” the complaint said."

environment,"In north-central Washington, hundreds of people in the town of Nespelem on the Colville Indian Agency were ordered to leave because of “imminent and life-threatening” danger as the largest of five wildfires caused by dozens of Monday night lightning strikes tore through grass, sagebrush and timber."
environment,Monte Piatote and his wife grabbed their pets and managed to flee but watched the fire burn the home where he’d lived since he was a child.
environment,"Blazes in Oregon and Washington were among some 60 large, active wildfires that have destroyed homes and burned through close to a million acres (1,562 square miles, 4,047 square kilometers) in a dozen mostly Western states, according to the National Interagency Fire Center."
environment,"“I told my wife, I told her, ‘Watch.’ Then boom, there it was,” Piatote told KREM-TV."
environment,"Seven homes burned but four were vacant and the entire town evacuated safely before the fire arrived, said Andrew Joseph Jr., chairman of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation that includes more than 9,000 descendants of a dozen tribes."
environment,The confederation declared a state of emergency Tuesday and said the reservation was closed to the public and to industrial activity. The declaration said weather forecasts called for possible triple-digit temperatures and 25-mph (40-kph) winds on Wednesday into Thursday that could drive the flames.
environment,"In Oregon, the lightning-sparked Bootleg Fire that had destroyed at least 20 homes was raging through lands near the California border on Wednesday. At least 2,000 homes were threatened by the fire."
environment,"“That’s sort of like having a new fire every day,” Enty said."
environment,"Crews were facing above-normal temperatures and bone-dry humidity coupled with afternoon gusts that were expected to create dangerous fire conditions through Wednesday, officials said. Members of the Oregon National Guard were expected to be deployed to help with road closures and traffic control in fire-affected areas."
environment,"The blaze had spread over 315 square miles (816 square kilometers), an area larger than New York City. Firefighters for the third day in a row had to back off occasionally for their safety and “weather isn’t going to change for the foreseeable future,” said Rob Allen, an incident commander."
environment,"Mark Enty, a spokesman for the Northwest Incident Management Team 10 that is working to contain the fire, said that since he arrived to the area last week the Bootleg Fire has doubled in size each day."
environment,The fire disrupted three transmission lines that provide electricity to California and the state’s power grid operator asked for voluntary power conservation Monday. The California Independent System Operator said Tuesday that the grid was stable and with the forecast for cooler temperatures another call for conservation was not expected.
environment,The fire in the Fremont-Winema National Forest was burning through a region where the Klamath Tribes — comprised of three distinct indigenous peoples — have lived for millennia.
environment,"“There is definitely extensive damage to the forest where we have our treaty rights,” said Don Gentry, the chairman of the Klamath Tribal Council in Chiloquin, Oregon, which is located about 25 miles (40 kilometers) west of the Bootleg Fire."
environment,"“I am sure we have lost a number of deer to the fire,” he said. “We are definitely concerned. I know there are cultural resource areas and sensitive areas that are likely the fire is going through.”"
environment,"The Klamath Tribes have been impacted by wildfires before, including one that burned 23 square miles (60 square kilometers) in southern Oregon last September. That fire damaged land where many of the Klamath tribal members hunt, fish and gather. The fire also burned the tribes’ cemetery and at least one tribal member’s house, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported in September."
environment,"“I can’t just buy another house, boom like that. I had insurance. I haven’t heard from them yet. I called them but I haven’t heard nothing.”"
environment,"Scientists say climate change has made the West much warmer and drier, and they warn that weather will get wilder as the world warms. They say extreme conditions are often from a combination of unusually random, short-term and natural weather patterns heightened by long-term, human-caused climate change. However, special studies are needed to determine how much global warming is to blame, if at all, for a single extreme weather event."
environment,"The tribes are struggling with drought-caused problems. In past decades, they have fought to preserve minimum water levels in Upper Klamath Lake to preserve two species of federally endangered sucker fish that are central to their culture and heritage. Farmers draw much of their irrigation water from the same lake that’s critical to the fish. Even before the fire erupted, extreme drought in southern Oregon had reduced water flows to historic lows."
environment,"In California, progress was reported on the state’s largest fire so far this year. The Beckwourth Complex, a combined pair of lighting-ignited blazes, was almost 50% contained after blackening more than 145 square miles (375 square kilometers) near the Nevada state line."
environment,"Damage was still being tallied in the small rural community of Doyle, California, where flames swept in during the weekend and destroyed several homes, including Beverly Houdyshell’s."
environment,"“What chance do I have to build another house, to have another home?” Houdyshell said. “No chance at all.”"

environment,"In fact, they had 18 snakes."
environment,"Trish Wilcher thought she saw a “piece of fuzz” on the floor under the bed in her home in Augusta, but when she reached for it, it suspiciously moved."
environment,"Her husband, Max Wilcher, was able to use a grabbing tool to contain the snakes in a linen bag. He released them outside near a creek, she told WJBF. A wildlife catcher later told the couple that the reptiles in their home were non-venomous garter snakes."
environment,"Georgia has both venomous and non-venomous snakes, according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. The agency notes that snakes are an important part of the ecosystem “because of their major role as both a predator and prey.”"
environment,"The Biden administration moved Thursday to reverse the Trump administration’s dismantling of protections in Alaska’s Tongass National Forest, the world’s largest intact temperate rainforest."
environment,"Snakes coming into people’s homes is relatively common, Georgia DNR biologist Daniel Sollenberger told the Augusta Chronicle, noting that they can come in through “small cracks” or open spaces such as holes around pipes under sinks. It’s common for snakes to come inside if a home has a mouse problem, in which case he noted that the snakes might actually be helpful."
environment,"Non-venomous snakes are safe to shoo outside using a broom and bucket, Sollenberger said. But if you’re unsure whether the snake is venomous, he recommended calling someone licensed to remove wildlife."
environment,"“Once they are gone, these are trees that have stored [carbon] for hundreds of years, it will take that long to gain it back,” Beverly Law, a professor emeritus at Oregon State and an expert on the forest carbon cycle, told HuffPost in May. “It also means that most of that carbon is going to go back to the atmosphere in the next few decades. And that’s not going to help us get any closer to meeting our climate goals. It’s going to make the situation worse.”"
environment,"The U.S Department of Agriculture announced its intent to “repeal or replace” a Trump-era rule that obliterated protections for Tongass by lifting Clinton-era logging restrictions across 9.3 million forested acres and reclassifying 188,000 acres, including 168,000 acres of old-growth timber, as immediately suitable for harvesting."
environment,"The agency also plans to invest $25 million in community and economic development, it said. "
environment,"Many environmentalists see safeguarding the 17-million-acre Tongass National Forest, known as “America’s Amazon,” as critical to fighting against global climate change. It stores about 8% of the total carbon isolated in forests in the Lower 48 states, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and an astonishing 44% of all carbon stored in national forests across the United States."
environment,"The announcement comes one day after Brazilian researchers found that parts of the Amazon rainforest in South America are now emitting more planet-warming carbon dioxide than they absorb, a signal that the world’s largest rainforest may have reached a tipping point. Biden has sought to pressure Brazil’s far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, to curb deforestation in the Amazon, only to have the Brazilian government point out the United States’ own history of intensively logging."
environment,"“With Alaska experiencing climate impacts more acutely than most, we shouldn’t be discussing the continued clearcutting of a natural climate solution that exists right in our own backyard,” Andy Moderow of the Alaska Wilderness League said in a statement Thursday. “Alaskans love their old-growth forests and the timber industry in Southeast is now a relic of the past, and the Biden administration should be commended for looking forward to what kind of world we want to leave to our kids. The Tongass is an unmatched treasure and with smart action now we can properly manage it for future generations.”"
environment,"Thursday’s action stems from an executive order that President Joe Biden signed his first day in office directing the Department of Agriculture to review Trump’s rollback in Tongass. It came as welcome news for conservationists, some of whom had grown frustrated in recent months by the administration’s lack of a strong commitment to halt logging of mature and old temperate forests in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest. "
environment,"While the agency’s announcement was limited on details, it said it will end large-scale commercial logging of old-growth timber within the forest and instead “focus management resources to support forest restoration, recreation and resilience, including for climate, wildlife habit and watershed improvement.” Limited harvesting of old-growth trees would be permitted for community and cultural use, including for constructing totem poles and canoes. "
environment,"“This approach will help us chart the path to long-term economic opportunities that are sustainable and reflect Southeast Alaska’s rich cultural heritage and magnificent natural resources,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said in a statement. "
environment,"June 2021, which saw record-breaking temperatures across the U.S., was the hottest June on record in the country, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced Friday."
environment,"“Exceptional heat waves from coast to coast helped push June 2021 to the No. 1 spot on the list of hottest Junes on record for the U.S.,” the agency said on its website."
environment,"Eight states — Arizona, California, Idaho, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Utah — logged their hottest June ever, NOAA said, while the contiguous U.S. as a whole recorded an average June temperature of more than 4 degrees above average at 72.4 degrees Fahrenheit."
environment,"The Pacific Northwest and parts of Canada endured a deadly heat wave at the end of the month that’s estimated to have killed hundreds. Scientists said in a new study this week that without climate change, the heat wave — which they described as a “once-in-a-millennium” event — would not have been possible."
environment,"If the Earth continues to warm at its current rate, such extreme heat “would go from essentially virtually impossible to relatively commonplace,” study co-author and climate scientist Gabriel Vecchi told The Associated Press. “That is a huge change.”"
environment,"At the end of June, almost half of the contiguous U.S. was considered in drought, NOAA noted."
environment,NOAA also said Friday that the U.S. had experienced eight weather and climate disasters with damages exceeding $1 billion in the first half of 2021.
environment,"Another heat wave descending on California and other parts of the western U.S. is expected to shatter temperature records, strain the power grid and threaten millions of people’s health."
environment,"These disasters included tornadoes in the Southeast in March and severe storms that pummeled Texas and Oklahoma in April, as well as the ongoing heat waves and drought impacting the western United States."
environment,"Temperatures were already approaching the triple digits across much of the region on Friday, and weather officials said people should prepare for it to get even hotter over the weekend. The weather will rival the heat waves that boiled the West andPacific Northwest just a few weeks ago, the latter of which killed nearly 200 people. "
environment,"California’s Death Valley may reach a sizzling 130 degrees on Sunday. That’s dangerously close to the hottest temperature ever recorded on Earth: 134 degrees in that same valley in 1913. Meanwhile, Las Vegas might topple its all-time heat record of 117 degrees this weekend. "
environment,"“Numerous daily high temperature records could be in jeopardy of being broken, particularly for California and Nevada. Highs could approach 115-120 degrees for the lower elevations of Arizona and eastern California this weekend!” the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center warned in its Friday forecast. "
environment,"Nearly the entire state of California is under an Excessive Heat Warning, the NWS’s most severe temperature category. That means there’s a “very high risk” of dangerous heat impacts for everybody in that area, “with little to no relief overnight.” Large swaths of Nevada and Utah and parts of Arizona, Idaho and Oregon are under the same heat warning. "
environment,"California’s power grid manager, the California Independent System Operator, is urging residents to reduce their energy consumption on Friday. From 4 p.m. through 9 p.m., people are asked to set thermostats to 78 degrees or higher; avoid using major appliances such as dishwashers, washing machines and dryers; and turn off as many lights as possible."
environment,"California is also in the midst of a crippling drought, which is exacerbated by the high temperatures. As of Friday, 85% of the state is in an “extreme drought,” the U.S. Drought Monitor has found, while 33% is in an even worse “exceptional drought.” "
environment,"Experts advise taking extra safety precautions when temperatures soar this high. People can protect themselves by wearing lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothing; by generously applying sunscreen and wearing wide-brimmed hats when outside; drinking plenty of water to minimize dehydration risks; and seeking medical help when people show signs of heatstroke ― a deadly response to heat that presents with high body temperature, a strong or racing pulse, hot and dry skin, excessive sweating, headache, nausea, dizziness, confusion and/or loss of consciousness."
environment,"The heat comes as a pair of wildfires deemed the Beckwourth Complex burn in Plumas National Forest, covering nearly 25,000 acres. Fire officials say the heat coupled with low humidity on Friday and Saturday will increase the fire activity."
environment,"Last week, Gov. Greg Gianforte withdrew Montana from a bipartisan coalition of more than two dozen states committed to upholding the goals of the Paris climate agreement, which include net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Brooke Stroyke, a spokesperson for Gianforte, told Montana Public Radio that the governor believes innovation, not government regulation, is the solution to climate change. "
environment,Montana’s Republican governor has made it clear his state won’t be bothered to help in the fight against climate change. But he still wants federal assistance to deal with the climate impacts at Montana’s door.
environment,"Two days later, Gianforte called on the U.S. Department of Agriculture to declare a drought emergency across his state, which would make emergency funds available to farmers who have suffered losses."
environment,"The situation is indeed getting worse. Climate change is exacerbating heat waves and drought across the globe, making events more frequent and extreme. And the sweltering, dry conditions are feeding early season wildfires in Montana."
environment,"“Data from the U.S. Drought Monitor now shows all counties in Montana experiencing abnormally dry to extreme drought conditions, and the situation continues to get worse,” Gianforte wrote on Twitter."
environment,One way to lessen the burden on wildland firefighters would be to take the climate threat seriously. Wildfires are forecast to become increasingly severe as climate change drives up temperatures and fuels drought. 
environment,"Gianforte also shared a tweet from the state’s fire protection program about dangerous fire conditions across western Montana. “Let’s work together to reduce the burden on our first responders and use extreme caution when working and recreating outdoors,” Gianforte wrote. "
environment,"Instead, Gianforte has blamed wildfires on “frivolous lawsuits from environmental extremists” and dismissed the scientific consensus that humans are the primary drivers of global climate change. In letters to at least two constituents while a member of Congress, he wrote that “the climate has been changing for millennia” and that “while the climate is changing, we still do not know how much of that change is due to human activities.” "
environment,"Frank Szollosi, executive director of conservation nonprofit Montana Wildlife Federation, said Gianforte’s actions demonstrate a “cognitive dissonance” and that withdrawing from the bipartisan alliance of governors is “an abdication of state leadership.”"
environment,"“Rivers in Montana are drying up this year, the fisheries are getting smoked, forest fires displace wildlife and there’s wildlife mortality — to say nothing of the personal property impact,” Szollosi said. “It’s just incongruent to try to stand with wildland firefighters when through the abdication of leadership on climate, you’re basically condemning the wildland firefighters of the future.” "
environment,Gianforte’s office did not immediately respond to HuffPost’s request for comment Monday. 
environment,"Gianforte’s wildfire message is as simplistic and incomplete as that of Smokey Bear, the Forest Service icon that for decades has been telling Americans “Only YOU can prevent wildfires” without discussing the benefits of natural fire on ecosystems and how climate change is impacting infernos. Business as usual in oil and gas production is one main reason states like Montana have found themselves choked in smoke every year. "
environment,"“This drought didn’t come out of nowhere, and if the current drought and the last decade of extreme weather across the country don’t convince you we’re in a crisis right now and that we bold action to avert disaster today and for the future, then you’re cementing the risk for the communities in your state,” Michael Kelly, director of communications at Clean Water Action, said via email. "
environment,"It’s not hard to understand how ending Montana’s participation in a bipartisan climate coalition and walking away from its goals risks further harm to Montana residents, including the agricultural producers Gianforte is now asking the federal government to assist. "

environment,"The Interior Department approved about 2,500 permits to drill on public and tribal lands in the first six months of the year, according to an Associated Press analysis of government data. That includes more than 2,100 drilling approvals since Biden took office January 20."
environment,"“They had no choice,” Oregon wildlife rehabber Lynn Tompkins told the East Oregonian. “It was just too bloody hot to survive.”"
environment,"“We’re about 140 birds over this same period last time,” rehab center general manager Rob Hope told CTC News Vancouver. “Unfortunately the little guys, because it got so hot, they had no choice but to try and cool off and they were getting themselves into trouble. They were falling out of the nest, jumping out the nests and a lot of the babies we did get unfortunately there were siblings that had perished within a few groups.”"
environment,Thirteen of the chicks had to be euthanized because their injuries were so severe. A blog post from the rehab center noted that the surviving birds were doing well and “eating an incredible amount of food.”
environment,"He added that the affected birds were primarily falcons, hawks and bald eagles."
environment,"Similar things happened in British Columbia, where OWL Orphaned Wildlife Rehabilitation Society experienced a “new high” when it came to baby birds in distress."
environment,"New Mexico and Wyoming had the largest number of approvals. Montana, Colorado and Utah had hundreds each."
environment,"Biden campaigned last year on pledges to end new drilling on federal landsto rein in climate-changing emissions. His pick to oversee those lands, Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, adamantly opposed drilling on federal lands while in Congress and co-sponsored the liberal Green New Deal."
environment,"But the steps taken by the administration to date on fossil fuels are more modest, including a temporary suspension on new oil and gas leases on federal lands that a judge blocked last month, blocked petroleum sales inthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) and cancellation of the Keystone XL oil pipelinefrom Canada."
environment,"Because vast fossil fuel reserves already are under lease, those actions did nothing to slow drilling on public lands and waters that account for about a quarter of U.S. oil production."
environment,"“Those easy wins don’t necessarily have huge impacts on the market today,” Fawcett said. “He is definitely backing off taking drastic action that would rock the market. ... What you’re going to see is U.S. oil production is going to continue to rebound.”"
environment,"“He’s walking the tightrope,” said energy industry analyst Parker Fawcett with S&P Global Platts, noting that Keystone and ANWR came without huge political costs because they were aimed at future projects."
environment,Haaland has sought to tamp down Republican concern over potential constraints on the industry. She said during a House Natural Resources Committee hearing last month that there was no “plan right now for a permanent ban.”
environment,Interior officials declined further comment on permits issued under Biden.
environment,Further complicating Biden’s climate agenda is a recent rise in gasoline prices to $3 a gallon ($0.79 a liter) or more in many parts of the country. Any attempt to limit petroleum production could push gasoline prices even higher and risk souring economic recovery from the pandemic.
environment,"“Gas and oil production will continue well into the future and we believe that is the reality of our economy and the world we’re living in,” Haaland told Colorado Republican Rep. Doug Lamborn."
environment,"Under former President Donald Trump, a staunch industry supporter, the Interior Department reduced the time it takes to review drilling applications from a year or more in some cases, to just a few months."
environment,"Companies rushed tolock in drilling rights before the new administration. And in December, Trump’s last full month in office, agency officials approved more than 800 permits — far more than any prior month during his presidency."
environment,The data obtained by AP from a government database is subject to change because of delays in transmitting data from Interior field offices to headquarters.
environment,"If the recent trends continue, the Interior Department could issue close to 6,000 permits by the end of the year. The last time so many were issued was fiscal year 2008, amid an oil boom driven by crude prices that reached an all-time high of $140 per barrel that June."
environment,"The pace dropped when Biden first took office, under a temporary order that elevated permit reviews to senior administration officials. Approvals have since rebounded to a level that exceeds monthly numbers seen through most of Trump’s presidency."
environment,"“Every indication is they have no plans of actually fulfilling their campaign promise,” said Mitch Jones, policy director for the environmental group Food & Water Watch. “The result of that will be continued and increasing development of fossil fuels on public lands, which means more climate change.”"
environment,Environmentalists who share the administration’s goals on climate have expressed growing frustration as prospects for a ban on drilling fade. They contend the administration could take executive action that would stop further permits but has caved to Republican pressure.
environment,That’s meant forgoing a drilling ban in hopes of getting bipartisan support for a huge infrastructure package that includes clean energy incentives and other measures to address global warming.
environment,"Decisions on about 4,700 drilling applications remained pending as of June 1, which means approvals are likely to continue at a heavy pace as officials work through a backlog left over from the Trump administration, said Fawcett, the industry analyst."
environment,"Economists and other experts have been skeptical about how much impact a permit ban would have. Companies simply could shift onto private and state lands and keep drilling, said University of Chicago deputy dean Ryan Kellogg."
environment,The administration’s defenders say it’s being pragmatic in the face of a Senate split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans and questions over whether the government could legally stop drilling on leases already sold to companies.
environment,"“It’s the long game. ... You’ve got to appease some of those oil and gas state senators,” said Jim Lyons, who was deputy assistant Interior secretary under Barack Obama and is now an environmental consultant. “It means jobs back home for thousands of workers. You can’t just pull the plug overnight.”"

environment,"Manatees eat about 10% of their body weight in vegetation each day, grazing across large, underwater seagrass meadows. But the plants are particularly vulnerable to water pollution and have declined in the Indian River Lagoon region — a prime manatee feeding zone — due to poor water quality, algae blooms and extreme weather."
environment,"The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission’s preliminary data points to a decline in seagrass that the manatees eat as the main cause. The previous annual record was set in 2013, when 830 manatees died over 12 months due to a toxic red tide."
environment,"At least 841 manatees have died in Florida waters during the first half of 2021, an unprecedented level of mortality that has already shattered the previous record for an entire year."
environment,"“Unprecedented manatee mortality due to starvation was documented on the Atlantic coast this past winter and spring,” the commission said in its report. “Most deaths occurred during the colder months when manatees migrated to and through the Indian River Lagoon where the majority of seagrass has died off. The long-term health effects of prolonged starvation in manatees that survived the Atlantic event to this point are not yet known.”"
environment,"The Associated Press notes that manatees were listed as endangered by the federal government, but rebounding numbers saw them downgraded to threatened in 2017. Some environmental groups have pointed to recent population declines as evidence the mammals should be afforded greater federal protection. "
environment,"In June, a coalition of environmental groups and businesses called on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) to declare a state of emergency to protect manatees, saying the time had come “to act boldly and effectively to rehabilitate our waterways.” "
environment,Boat strikes also remain a significant threat to manatees: 63 have been killed this year due to watercraft.
environment,"In March, scientists warned that manatees were dying at an alarming rate due to a combination of cold weather and the loss of seagrass. The rate of death was significant enough at the time to be declared an unusual mortality event by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service."
environment,"State officials, however, said such an act wasn’t necessary “at this time,”the TC Palm reported."
environment,"There are an estimated 7,520 manatees living in Florida waters."
environment,"The TCPalm website reports that more than half the deaths have died in the Indian River Lagoon and its surrounding areas in Volusia, Brevard, Indian River, St. Lucie and Martin counties. The overwhelming majority of deaths have been in Brevard, where 312 manatees have perished."

environment,Some biologists believe water pollution is killing the seagrass beds in the area.
environment,"“Unprecedented manatee mortality due to starvation was documented on the Atlantic coast this past winter and spring,” Florida’s Fish and Wildlife Research Institute wrote as it announced the record Friday. “Most deaths occurred during the colder months when manatees migrated to and through the Indian River Lagoon, where the majority of seagrass has died off.”"
environment,"Boat strikes are also a major cause of manatee deaths, killing at least 63 this year."
environment,"The manatee was once classified as endangered by the federal government, but it was reclassified as threatened in 2017. Environmentalists are asking that the animal again be considered endangered."
environment,Maximum sustained winds from the storm were 50 mph (85 kph) by late afternoon as the storm moved northeast from Boston toward Maine. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Elsa was no longer considered a tropical storm but still warned of heavy rainfall and gusty winds into Friday evening.
environment,"NEW YORK (AP) — The fast-moving storm Elsa lashed New York City and New England with heavy rain and high winds Friday, flooding streets, toppling trees and hindering some rail service."

environment,"Elsa had been powerful enough to bring about 3.5 inches (9 centimeters) of rain to areas of Massachusetts and Rhode Island by the early afternoon, flooding streets and stranding cars. West of Boston, Framingham police said Route 9 at Route 126 was closed because of high water."
environment,The storm came a day after a deluge flooded some streets and subway stations in New York City.
environment,"“We’re waiting on the water to recede,” said Joe Soto, the city’s emergency management director. “The drainage system was just overwhelmed.”"
environment,"Most of the winds stayed offshore in New England but the eastern tip of Maine expected gusts of 30 mph to 40 mph (48 kph to 64 kph), raising concerns about some localized power outages. Heavy rain — including a projected 5 inches (12 centimeters) along part of the Maine coast — was expected before the storm blew into the Bay of Fundy and Canada late Friday."
environment,"Up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain was possible in some areas Friday, enough to cause flash flooding."
environment,"Despite videos showing flooding in some stations Thursday, “we actually weathered the storm quite well,” interim New York City Transit president Sarah Feinberg said in an email."

environment,"TURNER, Ore. (AP) — The heat wave that recently hit the Pacific Northwest subjected the region’s vineyards to record-breaking temperatures nine months after the fields that produce world-class wine were blanketed by wildfire smoke."
environment,"This cool, rainy part of the country normally experiences plenty of sunny summer days but winemakers are worried about what’s still ahead amid a historic drought tied to climate change: Extremely high temperatures could hit yet again, and wildfires are expected to be ferocious."
environment,"The good news for grape growers, wineries and wine lovers is the historic heat wave came during a narrow window when the fruit suffered little, if any, damage. Earlier or later in the growing season, it could have been disastrous."
environment,"That includes Christine Clair, winery director of Willamette Valley Vineyards in the city of Turner, just outside Oregon’s capital. She watched rare winds last September smother the Willamette Valley, famed for its delicate pinot noir, in smoke from nearby flames."
environment,"“Last year was our first experience in the Willamette Valley with wildfires and smoke impact from them. Though it was considered a once-in-a-100-year east wind event, we believe we are at risk annually now,” Clair said."
environment,"In recent years, wineries worldwide began hedging their bets against global warming and its fallout by moving to cooler zones, planting varieties that do better in heat and drought, and shading their grapes with more leaf canopy."
environment,"At Dusted Valley Vintners, in Walla Walla, Washington, less of the leaf canopy will be trimmed to keep the grapes shaded and prevent sunburn, co-owner Chad Johnson said."
environment,"Similarly, in the wake of the Northwest heat wave, wineries plan to protect their crops from more blistering sunshine."
environment,"Workers, who are restricted to morning work on very hot days, also will leave more grapes on the vine so the fruit ripens slower, Johnson said."
environment,"“It is definitely unusual and unprecedented in my career since I’ve been making wine for 20 years here,” Johnson said."
environment,"He has never seen conditions so early in the summer like those during the heat wave, with the thermometer climbing above 100 F (38 C) for several days in the eastern Washington town near the Oregon border."
environment,"Climate change, Johnson noted, has become a major concern for him and other wine producers worldwide."
environment,"June 29 was the hottest day in Walla Walla’s recorded history, reaching 116 F (47 C) and breaking the previous record by two degrees."
environment,"“If it’s not this early horrible spring frost they’re having over in Europe this year, it’s wildfires in the West, with the drought. It’s always something,” Johnson said. “And it’s getting just more severe every year.”"
environment,"The industry, meanwhile, has been totaling the damage from last year’s wildfires that covered California, Oregon and Washington state in thick smoke."
environment,"The bad news is that extreme weather events and wildfires are apt to become more frequent because of climate change. A less intense heat wave again hit parts of the U.S. West just about a week after extreme temperatures gripped the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia on June 25 and lingered for several days, causing what could be hundreds of heat-related deaths."
environment,So many California growers worried about unpleasant “smoke taint” in the wine produced from their grapes that they tried to get the fruit tested to see if the crops were worth harvesting.
environment,"Industry estimates show California growers had losses of $601 million from wine grapes that went unharvested, Aguirre said."
environment,"“Without question the financial toll on California winegrape growers has proven to be unprecedented,” John Aguirre, president of the California Association of Winegrape Growers, said in an email."
environment,"“The risk of wildfires appears to be greater today than in the past and that is very, very troubling for many growers,” Aguirre said, noting that they also must contend with heat, drought, frost, excessive rain, pests and disease."
environment,The few testing labs were so overwhelmed they couldn’t meet demand. Some wineries opted not to risk turning some of their own grapes into bad wine and hurting their brand and stopped accepting untested grapes from growers.
environment,"A report on California’s harvest by the San Francisco-based Wine Institute said that despite the challenges, many winemakers are excited about the 2020 vintage."
environment,"Wineries can do little to prevent wildfires outside their property, but if they become inundated with smoke, they can try to minimize damage. For example, they may turn some of the grapes with heavier smoke exposure into rosé instead of red wine. That limits contact with the skin of the grape during wine production and can lower the concentration of smoke aroma compounds."
environment,"Corey Beck, CEO and head of winemaking at Francis Ford Coppola Winery in Sonoma County, California, said he is optimistic based on small-batch fermentation trials."
environment,"“It was like, ‘Oh my god, these wines are terrific,’” Beck told the Wine Institute."
environment,Willamette Valley Vineyards also had fermented small samples of grapes to gauge whether smoke would affect the resulting wine. Its Whole Cluster Pinot Noir 2020 vintage received good ratings from Wine Enthusiast magazine.
environment,"But winemaking has become so difficult and competitive that when people ask Johnson for advice about getting into the industry, he tries to dissuade them."
environment,"“The first thing I do is tell them that’s probably not a good idea,” he said. “It’s really, really hard, and it’s getting harder and harder.”"
coronavirus,The president of a leading U.S. teachers union came out in support of vaccine mandates for teachers on Sunday.
coronavirus,"“As a matter of personal conscience, we need to be working with employers on vaccine mandates,” Randi Weingarten, head of the American Federation of Teachers, told Chuck Todd on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”"
coronavirus,"The AFT represents 1.7 million members across the country and is the second-largest teachers union, after the National Education Association. Support from the union’s leadership could make it easier to implement requirements that teachers be vaccinated if they’re going to teach in-person."
coronavirus,"The announcement caps an evolution on the mandate issue for Weingarten. Consistent with her union’s official position, Weingarten had previously said vaccines were the most effective way to deal with the virus, and that all teachers should be urged to get them, but they should not be required to."
coronavirus,But Weingarten said Sunday that she and the leadership within her union had decided to “revisit and reconsider” that policy. In recent days she had signaled a growing openness on mandates as some labor unions came under fire for opposing them. 
coronavirus,"The delta variant of COVID-19 had altered the dynamic, Weingarten explained Sunday."
coronavirus,"“The circumstances have changed,” she said. “It weighs really heavily on me that kids under 12 can’t get vaccinated.”"
coronavirus,"Teachers, on the whole, have embraced the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for emergency use at a higher rate than the general population. According to the White House, almost 90% of educators and school staff are vaccinated. Meanwhile, around 71% of U.S. adults have received at least one dose of the vaccine. "
coronavirus,"However, some 11% of teachers said they do not plan to get vaccinated, according to a recent EdWeek Research Center survey. "
coronavirus,"Until now, teachers unions have generally said carrots were better than sticks when it comes to reaching those holdouts. They said teachers should be nudged to get vaccines but should be allowed to undergo regular testing for the virus instead if they prefer."
coronavirus,"But rising caseloads around the country now threaten to derail in-person classes this fall, leading school districts to consider implementing mandates. The federal government and some states have already moved to institute such requirements, with President Joe Biden announcing late last month that vaccines would be mandatory for federal employees who wanted to continue working."
coronavirus,"The idea of vaccine mandates has put some unions in a tricky spot. Many of their members, just like the general population, do not want the shots despite the dangers unvaccinated workers bring to a workplace. A few unions have come out directly against mandates. Others have said they want to negotiate with employers on how a mandate will be implemented and enforced, since unions typically bargain over health and safety matters."
coronavirus,"Weingarten said if employers want to implement mandates, they would still need to include religious and medical exemptions from vaccination."
coronavirus,"Bars in Portland, Oregon; Seattle; and San Francisco have joined together to create “vax coalitions” that will only allow customers inside who can prove they’ve been vaccinated."
coronavirus,"“There’s ways of which you can do accommodations in all sorts of different ways, which is part of the reason you have to work together on these vaccine policies,” she said. "
coronavirus,Similar groups are already up and running elsewhere on the West Coast. 
coronavirus,"Fifteen bars in Portland have already joined the informal “Vaxx Coaliton,” and an additional 20 are expected to sign up Monday, Teardrop Lounge owner Daniel Shoemaker told Willamette Week. At least one of the establishments is requiring proof of vaccination — or a negative COVID-19 test within 48 hours of bellying up to the bar."
coronavirus,"Late last month, 300 bars in the San Francisco Bar Owners Alliance announced they would require customers to show proof of vaccination or a negative test in order to sit inside. It’s one of the largest pro-vax industry efforts in the nation, Forbes reports."
coronavirus,"“We believe we are obligated to protect our workers and their families, and to offer a safe space for customers to relax and socialize,” the alliance told The Associated Press in a statement. "
coronavirus,"But the group hopes that requesting proof of vaccination “might also influence some who have not yet received vaccinations” to do so as soon as they can, the statement read."
coronavirus,"“We understand that the only way our society (and our businesses) can ever return to true normalcy is through higher rates of vaccinations among our residents,” the alliance added."
coronavirus,Officials report that 69% of San Francisco residents are already fully vaccinated against COVID-19. 
coronavirus,"The only fallout the groups have reportedly experienced so far is from online anti-vax trolls, many of whom have flooded internet sites with negative reviews. Part of the reason for the coalitions is to make it harder to single out a bar taking a pro-vax stance, noted Shoemaker."
coronavirus,"Elsewhere, cities are taking the initiative to require either vaccinations or negative tests in businesses. "
coronavirus,Los Angeles officials are also considering a policy that would require proof of at least one vaccination to enter indoor businesses.
coronavirus,"New York City already passed a regulation that patrons wishing to enter indoor restaurants, gyms and performance spaces will need to show proof of vaccination, starting Aug. 16."
coronavirus,"CNN has fired three employees who were caught going into an office unvaccinated against COVID-19, according to a staff memo from network President Jeff Zucker."
coronavirus,"“Let me clear — we have a zero-tolerance policy on this,” Zucker warned in the email to employees shared on Twitter by CNN media reporter Oliver Darcy on Thursday."
coronavirus,"“You need to be vaccinated to come to the office,” Zucker continued. “And you need to be vaccinated to work in the field, with other employees, regardless of whether you enter an office or not.”"
coronavirus,"CNN’s employees don’t have to provide documentary proof of vaccination, The Wall Street Journal reported. That policy is now reportedly under review."
coronavirus,Details about the firings weren’t revealed. Zucker said CNN was “made aware” of the workers’ vaccination status in the last week.
coronavirus,"In his memo, Zucker also announced the postponement of the company’s planned date for all employees to return to offices."
coronavirus,"The Sept. 7 target was pushed back indefinitely amid the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant of the virus, meaning in-office work remains on a voluntary basis for the foreseeable future, he wrote."
coronavirus,"“I think it is fair to say that we are all feeling a mix of anticipation, anxiety, frustration, confusion, and exasperation … I get it,” Zucker said in the memo.“Continue to take care of yourselves and each other. And I will share more updates just as soon as we have them.”"
coronavirus,"Multiple U.S. companies and federal agencies have mandated that part or all of their workforce be vaccinated, including meatpacking giant Tyson Foods and social media platform Facebook."
coronavirus,"DeChambeau tested positive for COVID-19 and was prevented from competing in Tokyo. In an interview Wednesday at a golf tournament in Memphis, the 2020 U.S. Open champ suggested, inaccurately, the vaccine was in short supply and that he was doing the selfless thing."
coronavirus,"Bryson DeChambeau can drive a golf ball a country mile, but his explanation for not getting vaccinated before the Olympics is full of holes."
coronavirus,"“I’m young enough, I’d rather give it [the vaccine] to people who need it,” he told ESPN. “I don’t need it. I’m a healthy, young individual that will continue to work on my health."
coronavirus,"But experts urge even greater compliance as the delta variant continues spreading, mostly among people who are unvaccinated. "
coronavirus,"“I don’t think taking the vaccine away from someone who needs it is a good thing,” the world’s seventh-ranked golfer added. “My dad is a perfect example. He got it [the vaccine] early on because he’s a diabetic. People like that need to get it. My mom got it. I don’t want to take away that ability.”"
coronavirus,"In another head-slap moment, DeChambeau, 27, appeared to say he would get the vaccine when it becomes popular."
coronavirus,The U.S. reported this week that 70% of eligible adults had received at least one vaccine dose. That seems mainstream. 
coronavirus,"“Now as time goes on, if it [the vaccine] is mainstream, really, really mainstream, then yeah,” he said, per CBS."
coronavirus,The United States has a surplus of vaccines and millions of doses are about to go to waste.

coronavirus,"TOKYO (AP) — Tokyo reported 5,042 new daily coronavirus cases on Thursday, hitting a record since the pandemic began as the infections surge in the Japanese capital hosting the Olympics."
coronavirus,"The additional cases brought the total for Tokyo to 236,138, about a quarter of the national total. Japan reported more than 14,000 cases on Wednesday for a total of 970,000."
coronavirus,"“We need to tackle the situation as we now have a stronger sense of urgency,” Prime Minister Yosihide Suga told reporters, referring to Tokyo’s new record exceeding 5,000 cases for the first time. “The infections are expanding at the pace we have never experienced before.”"
coronavirus,"Tokyo has been under a state of emergency since mid-July, and four other areas have since been added and extended until Aug. 31. But the measures, basically a ban on alcohol in restaurants and bars and their shorter hours, are increasingly ignored by the public, which has become tired of restrictions."
coronavirus,"Instead, Suga on Thursday announced a milder version of the emergency measures in eight prefectures, including Fukushima in the east and Kumamoto in the south, expanding the areas to 13 prefectures. The less-stringent measures allow prefectural heads to target specific towns but cannot order business closures."
coronavirus,"Suga, who has been criticized for insisting on hosting the Olympics despite the coronavirus spreading, says there is no evidence linking the surge in cases to the July 23-Aug. 8 Games. He urged people to firmly stick to the emergency requests and stay home despite the summer vacation."
coronavirus,"Alarmed by the pace of the spread, some experts have called for a current state of emergency in Tokyo and five other areas to be expanded nationwide."
coronavirus,"Experts at a Tokyo metropolitan government panel cautioned that infections propelled by the more contagious delta variant have become “explosive” and could exceed 10,000 cases a day in two weeks."
coronavirus,Suga also pledged to “prevent the further spread of the virus by firmly carrying out vaccinations.”
coronavirus,Experts say people are not cooperating because many feel less of a sense of urgency about the pandemic while the Olympics are going ahead and Suga’s government keeps issuing the same requests for people to stay at home.
coronavirus,"Measures targeting business owners start from requests and increase to orders, and violators can be fined, though this rarely happens. Those who comply can receive compensation, but thousands of eateries still stay open after the requested 8 p.m. closing time. Measures for the general public are only requests, including stay home, wear a mask outside and avoid nonessential trips."
coronavirus,"Japan has managed to keep its cases and deaths lower than much of the world, but testing is still insufficient and Tokyo’s positivity rate stands at 20%, indicating widespread infections."
coronavirus,"In Tokyo, more than 14,000 patients with mild symptoms are currently isolating at home — more than a tenfold increase from a month ago — and about 8,400 others are waiting for beds in hospitals or special hotels."
coronavirus,"As hospital beds start to fill, Suga’s government this week introduced a new policy in which coronavirus patients with moderate symptoms will isolate at home instead of in hospitals, an attempt to save hospital beds almost exclusively for serious COVID-19 patients."
coronavirus,Opposition lawmakers criticized Suga for not increasing hospital capacity sufficiently despite warnings about the fast-spreading delta variant. Coronavirus treatment in Japan is limited to public and university hospitals that have adequate facilities and expertise.

coronavirus,"The event will be held outside. All guests must be fully vaccinated and submit negative test results before entrance, according to reports. An appointed “COVID-coordinator” will oversee the party. It’s not known if masks will be mandatory."
coronavirus,"President Joe Biden will not attend, but “looks forward to catching up with former President Obama soon and properly welcome him to the over-sixty club,” said a White House spokesperson."
coronavirus,"Martha’s Vineyard, in Dukes County, is currently not deemed at high risk of a coronavirus outbreak. But a cluster of COVID-19 cases among vaccinated people in nearby Provincetown last month prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to reintroduce its advice for wearing masks indoors."
coronavirus,The worrying rise in coronavirus cases in recent weeks ― especially among the unvaccinated ― has prompted the reintroduction of some COVID-19 safety protocols.
coronavirus,It’s a moment every athlete at the Olympic Games has dreamed about: standing on the podium and bowing their head to receive a well-earned medal around their neck.
coronavirus,"The United Food and Commercial Workers, a union representing about 24,000 of Tyson’s 120,000 employees, rejects the mandate. In a statement, the union said the company should wait until the Food and Drug Administration grants the vaccines full approval, instead of the emergency use authorization licenses they have right now. "
coronavirus,"“We did not take this decision lightly,” Tyson CEO Donnie King said in a letter to employees. “We take this step today because nothing is more important than our team members’ health and safety, and we thank them for the work they do, every day, to help us feed this country, and our world.”"
coronavirus,"Exceptions will be considered for those workers who seek “medical or religious accommodation,” the company noted."
coronavirus,"Only about half of Tyson’s employees ― or about 56,000 people ― have had their shots so far, said the company, which supplies roughly 20% of the U.S. supply of beef, pork and chicken each year. "
coronavirus,Tyson is requiring all of its office workers to be fully vaccinated by Oct. 1 and all front-line workers to be fully vaccinated by Nov. 1. All new hires will need to be vaccinated before their first day.
coronavirus,"However, things looked a little different in Tokyo this year. Due to COVID-19 protocols, Olympic officials have been presenting medals on a tray for the athletes to don themselves. Ahead of the Games, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach told reporters the policy would mean “that the athlete can be sure that nobody touched them before.”"
coronavirus,"But in a sweet show of sportsmanship, athletes at the Tokyo Games — especially in events with more than one person on a team — have been placing medals on one another, making for some touching, photo-worthy moments. In an Olympics where COVID-19 has forced so much to change, this is one new tradition we wouldn’t mind seeing again."
coronavirus,"Tyson Foods, one of America’s largest meatpacking companies, announced Tuesday that it would require all employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19, a policy change that is expected to affect more than half of its workforce. "
coronavirus,"The meatpacking company is one of many large corporations and institutions across America that have begun implementing vaccine mandates for workers in recent weeks, amid the surge in COVID-19 infections driven by the highly contagious delta variant. "
coronavirus,Employers across the U.S. are legally permitted to require the vaccine of their employees. Read more about vaccine mandates here.
coronavirus,"As a token of thanks, the company said, all front-line meatpacking employees will receive an additional $200 after providing verification of their vaccination status. Tyson has already been offering up to four hours of hourly workers’ pay for getting the shots outside their normal shifts in an effort to encourage more vaccinations."
coronavirus,The 2022 Festival is requiring people attending the festival or Sundance-affiliated events to have received the COVID-19 vaccine.
coronavirus,"Yet, in an article published Monday, the company told The Associated Press that it had held more than 100 vaccination events for its employees and had no plans to mandate the shots."
coronavirus,"“While we support and encourage workers getting vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus, and have actively encouraged our members to do so, it is concerning that Tysons is implementing this mandate before the FDA has fully approved the vaccine,” UFCW International President Marc Perrone said in a statement."
coronavirus,"All participants must be fully vaccinated too, festival director Tabitha Jackson said Tuesday."
coronavirus,"Last year, in the early months of the pandemic, Tyson was besieged by coronavirus outbreaks in its packing plants, which normally require workers to stand close together in order to do their jobs, prompting temporary closures. Other meatpacking plants were hard-hit, as well."
coronavirus,Tyson now says it will collaborate with local health providers and authorities to offer even more inoculation opportunities. 
coronavirus,The 2022 Festival is set for Jan. 20-30.
coronavirus,That means everyone from volunteers to filmmakers and passholders. More details will follow in the coming months.
coronavirus,"Following the largely virtual Sundance earlier this year, organizers are planning to hold in-person events in 2022 with screenings in Park City and Salt Lake City, Utah, as well as some “satellite” screenings at regional theaters throughout the U.S."
coronavirus,Anyone looking to go to the Sundance Film Festival in Utah next year is going to need more than a badge.
coronavirus,"“I understand the concerns of those who are hesitant,” Byrd stated. “To them, I would say COVID is real and it is very dangerous.” "
coronavirus,"Byrd was hospitalized on Dec. 5, the beginning of an eight-month ordeal that included 55 days on a ventilator. After he seemed to be recovering, his liver failed and he needed a transplant. "
coronavirus,"“We congratulate the people of Tennessee for clearly seeing that the mainstream media has sensationalized the reporting on COVID-19 in the service of political agendas,” the resolution said. "
coronavirus,"As the nation battled the coronavirus last year, Byrd was among 55 members of the Tennessee House who advanced a conspiracy-fueled message that downplayed the infection and blamed the media. "
coronavirus,"“It is a disease that wants to kill us,” state Rep. David Byrd wrote over the weekend in a statement cited by NewsChannel 5 in Nashville. “Please take it seriously.” "
coronavirus,"The Tennesseean reported that Byrd attended a state House Republican retreat in November, which included a dinner with dozens present, and he was seen on the House floor without a mask on Nov. 24. "
coronavirus,Byrd was diagnosed with coronavirus one day later. 
coronavirus,"“Foolishly, I believed this virus only seriously affected people who are at high risk,” he stated. “COVID took over my lungs with lightning speed. I developed pneumonia. I got sicker and sicker, and more and more anxious. Every breath was pure agony.” "
coronavirus,A GOP lawmaker in Tennessee who once backed a bill claiming the media sensationalized the coronavirus “in the service of political agendas” has a new message after nearly dying of the infection. 
coronavirus,"Now that Byrd has fought the infection himself, he said the issue should not divide people. "
coronavirus,"Byrd said his family was faced with “the very real prospect of planning my funeral” as the infection took over his lungs “with lightning speed.” And while he was unconscious, his family was traumatized daily by his illness. He is now urging people to get vaccinated. "
coronavirus,"The Washington Post reported that the rate was even lower in Byrd’s district, at 31%. "
coronavirus,The Tennessean reported that he has never publicly denied the allegations. 
coronavirus,Byrd released a statement at the time refusing to resign and apologizing “if I hurt or emotionally upset any of my students.”
coronavirus,"According to data cited by The New York Times, Tennessee has seen hospitalizations more than double over the past two weeks. Just 39%t of the state’s residents are fully vaccinated, well below the national average of 49%."
coronavirus,"“I hope that by sharing my experience it helps others to act against an enemy that knows no skin color, economic status or political affiliation,” he stated. "
coronavirus,"In 2018, three women accused Byrd of sexually assaulted them when they were teenagers and he was their high school basketball coach in the 1980s, leading to bipartisan calls for his resignation. "
coronavirus,"House lawmakers on Friday attempted but, ultimately failed, to pass a bill to extend the moratorium even for a few months. Some Democratic lawmakers had wanted it extended until the end of the year."
coronavirus,The Biden administration announced Thursday it will allow a nationwide ban to expire. It argued that its hands are tied after the U.S. Supreme Court signaled the moratorium would only be extended until the end of the month.
coronavirus,"BOSTON (AP) — Evictions, which have mostly been on pause during the pandemic, are expected to ramp up on Monday after the expiration of a federal moratorium as housing courts take up more cases and tenants are locked out of their homes."
coronavirus,"“Struggling renters are now facing a health crisis and an eviction crisis,” said Alicia Mazzara, a senior research analyst at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities."
coronavirus,"More than 15 million people live in households that owe as much as $20 billion to their landlords, according to the Aspen Institute. As of July 5, roughly 3.6 million people in the U.S. said they faced eviction in the next two months, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey."
coronavirus,"“Without the CDC’s moratorium, millions of people are at risk of being evicted or becoming homeless, increasing their exposure to COVID just as cases are rising across the country. The effects will fall heavily on people of color, particularly Black and Latino communities, who face greater risk of eviction and more barriers to vaccination.”"
coronavirus,Parts of the South and other regions with weaker tenant protections will likely see the largest spikes and communities of color where vaccination rates are sometimes lower will be hit hardest. But advocates say this crisis is likely to have a wider impact than pre-pandemic evictions.
coronavirus,Housing advocates fear the end of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention moratorium could result in millions of people being evicted in the coming weeks. But most expect an uptick in filings in the coming days rather than a wave of evictions.
coronavirus,"The Biden administration had hoped that historic amounts of rental assistance allocated by Congress in December and March would help avert an eviction crisis. But the distribution has been painfully slow. So far, only about $3 billion of the first tranche of $25 billion has been distributed through June by states and localities. Another $21.5 billion will go to the states."
coronavirus,"Sgt. William Brown, who leads the evictions unit for the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office, said he doesn’t know how quickly evictions will ramp up after the moratorium ends. Landlords still have to go through several steps before they can evict. But he said he has no doubt that many more people will be forced out, rattling off statistics that show the steep decline in evictions since the pandemic began: nearly 4,000 in 2018 and 2019, then a steep plunge to about 1,900 in 2020."
coronavirus,"“It frustrates me and scares me,” she said of being evicted. “I’m trying so hard to make it right and it doesn’t seem like it’s enough.”"
coronavirus,"Ashley Phonsyry, 22, who will be in court Thursday for an eviction hearing after falling several thousands dollars behind on her Fayetteville, Arkansas, two-bedroom apartment, said her landlord has refused to take rental assistance. She left her job after being hurt in a domestic violence incident and suffering from depression and anxiety. The eviction hearing is a day after her domestic violence case goes to court."
coronavirus,"“The scales of justice are just at this incredible imbalance,” Camp said."
coronavirus,"Lee Camp, an attorney with the St. Louis legal group ArchCity Defenders, said the vast majority of tenants facing eviction don’t have lawyers, often because they can’t afford them. Meanwhile, he said, eviction cases move through the courts quickly in Missouri, often in a matter of weeks."
coronavirus,"Around the country, courts, legal advocates and law enforcement agencies are gearing up for evictions to return to pre-pandemic levels, a time when 3.7 million people were displaced from their homes every year, or seven every minute, according to the Eviction Lab at Princeton University."
coronavirus,"“It’s the most challenging position that I’ve ever been in, because at the end of the day I have an empathy and sympathy. I’m required by state statute to execute this,” he said. “You have to feel for these people ... watching small kids go through this, this entire process.”"
coronavirus,"“We already know that we have about 126 evictions already lined up. What we’re planning on doing is tripling our two-man team,” he said. “Right off the bat we want to clean up that 126 evictions.”"
coronavirus,"In St. Louis, the sheriff’s office handles court-ordered evictions. Sheriff Vernon Betts said 126 evictions have been ordered and are just waiting for the moratorium to end. His office plans to enforce about 30 evictions per day starting Aug. 9."
coronavirus,"Betts knows there will be hundreds of additional orders soon. He’s already been contacted by countless landlords who haven’t yet filed for eviction, but plan to. And he expected to increase his staffing."
coronavirus,"In Wisconsin, Heiner Giese, legal counsel for the Apartment Association of Southeastern Wisconsin, said his trade association for rental property owners in the Milwaukee area has been “very strong in urging our members and all landlords not to evict.”"
coronavirus,"“Absolutely. Absolutely,” he said. “I think that once evictions are there fully, there’s no more moratorium in place, it’s going to get really bad.”"
coronavirus,Associated Press writers Jim Salter in St. Louis and Doug Glass in Minneapolis contributed to this report.
coronavirus,"Still, Colleen Foley, executive director of the Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee, said she “certainly” expects an uptick. She said 161 evictions were filed last week, a significant increase from prior weeks where filings tended to hover around 100 to 120. She said she was waiting to hear when those cases would go to court."
coronavirus,"“I pretty strongly believe from the feedback we get from our members in the Milwaukee area … there will not be this giant tsunami of (evictions),” Giese said."
coronavirus,"“I feel like I have a sinus infection and at present time I have mild symptoms,” he tweeted. “I am very glad I was vaccinated because without vaccination I am certain I would not feel as well as I do now. My symptoms would be far worse.”"
coronavirus,"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced Monday that he has tested positive for COVID-19 and is showing symptoms of the disease, while expressing gratitude that he has been vaccinated."
coronavirus,Graham said he will quarantine for 10 days.
coronavirus,The 66-year-old said he started having flu-like symptoms on Saturday night and went to see a doctor Monday morning. He was seen at the U.S. Capitol on Monday wearing a mask before making his announcement on social media.
coronavirus,"It’s extremely rare for vaccinated people to contract the virus, though it is still possible because no vaccine is 100% effective."
coronavirus,"CNN’s Manu Raju tweeted that over the weekend, Graham attended a houseboat party hosted by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.). A spokesperson for Manchin declined to confirm Graham’s attendance to HuffPost, but said that Manchin, 73, is fully vaccinated and is following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines for people exposed to someone who has tested positive for COVID-19."
coronavirus,"Health officials ask that people who feel sick stay at home, unless they are seeking medical care, to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. They should separate themselves from other people, wear a face mask if possible, and call ahead before visiting their doctor."
coronavirus,"Graham was vaccinated in late December and had publicly encouraged others to get the shot, saying in a social media post: “If enough of us take it, we will get back to normal lives.”"
coronavirus,"Fewer than 45% of residents in South Carolina, a reliable Republican stronghold, have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to the state’s Department of Health and Environmental Control. This is less than the overall U.S. rate, which is just under 50%, according to the CDC."
coronavirus,"Several prominent conservatives have only recently started to speak outin support of vaccines, including Fox News host Sean Hannity, who’d previously called COVID-19 a “hoax,” and House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.)."
coronavirus,Recent polls have shown that Republicans are more likely to express vaccine skepticism than people who identify as Democratic or independent. Vaccination rates have also largely been lower in counties that voted Republican in the 2020 presidential election.
coronavirus,"Goodwyn was charged in January with entering the Capitol during the violent Jan. 6 riot, and has been released on home confinement before his trial. The government said Goodwyn tried to chew through a mask and spit it out when arrested in January, forcing the FBI to go through about five masks during his arrest. Then in June, Goodwyn again refused to wear a mask in the pretrial services office. "
coronavirus,"A federal judge came down hard on accused Capitol rioter Daniel Goodwyn for refusing to wear a mask when in contact with officers before his trial, telling the member of the far-right group the Proud Boys: “We have a virus that is killing people — why is it so hard to wear a mask?”"
coronavirus,"In a virtual hearing Friday, U.S. District Judge Reggie Walton slammed Goodwyn for his attempts to reject a mask after his January arrest and for continuing to refuse to wear one since with pretrial services officers. "
coronavirus,"“We have a virus that is killing people,” the judge said Friday, noting that if Goodwyn continued to not comply, he would be arrested and jailed. “Why is it so hard to wear a mask?”"
coronavirus,"After Goodwyn responded that it “stresses [him] out” to wear one, the judge said he wouldn’t “be a part of other people dying because of what you don’t believe.” "
coronavirus,"Then when Goodwyn said he didn’t believe masks reduced virus transmission, Judge Walton asked: “When did you go to medical school, sir? Do you have a medical degree?”"
coronavirus,"Goodwyn’s lawyer said his client was not vaccinated and claimed Goodwyn was autistic. Goodwyn’s mother said her son saw an autism specialist and she believes he has Asperger’s syndrome. The judge said he wants proof of the diagnosis, and he was holding off on issuing an arrest warrant given the potential diagnosis."
coronavirus,"Goodwyn is one of more than 400 people that federal authorities have arrested and charged in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, in which hundreds of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election, which President Joe Biden won. Five people died in the riot, including a Capitol Police officer."
coronavirus,"Coronavirus cases are on the rise across the country as the highly contagious delta variant spreads, with cases overwhelmingly among people who are unvaccinated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged people to wear masks indoors, even if vaccinated, in areas of substantial or high transmission. "

coronavirus,"Everyone loves to complain about work, but no one outside the office really cares about your gripes. "
coronavirus,"Saunders, who goes by the nickname “The Hulk,” has been wearing a mask that looks like the mouth of the Joker in “Batman.”"
coronavirus,"Yet that’s what many Republican lawmakers have been doing for the last three days, breathlessly, since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) reimposed a mask mandate for members, staff and visitors. The move, ordered by the congressional physician, comes in response to the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus spreading around the country. "
coronavirus,"And if you’re a member of Congress, you have far more important things to talk about anyway than how hard it is for you to wear a mask during a pandemic."
coronavirus,"House and Senate Republicans have complained on Twitter, in conservative media outlets, on the House floor, in press conferences and even in the courts about having to wear a mask at work. They have called Pelosi a dictator, a tyrant, an ”authoritarian lame-duck speaker” (what?) and dared the Capitol Police to arrest them. "
coronavirus,"While they have also complained about mask mandates in general, their public outrage this week is more focused on how inconvenient it is for them."
coronavirus,"Pelosi’s mask rule came after Dr. Brian Monahan, the attending physician of Congress, wrote a memo Tuesday saying that all House members and staff ― regardless of vaccination status ― must wear a “well-fitted, medical grade, filtration face mask” at work. The Senate’s mask policy is largely voluntary for now."
coronavirus,"“Madam Speaker, you are not God,” Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.) said in a floor speech, referring to Pelosi. “Your will does not bend the forest or shake the mountains. And let me assure you, your will does not bow the knee of millions of my countrymen who refuse to heed your callous command. To threaten arrest on others for their own personal medical decisions is nothing short of a medical apartheid, and I will not let it stand.”"
coronavirus,"The rule has only been in effect since Wednesday, which means Republican lawmakers will have only had to wear masks for three days before they adjourn for a long summer recess. When they leave Friday, they are not scheduled to be back in Congress until Sept. 20. The House mask rule could ― and likely will ― be the same when they return, but with the ever-changing pandemic, it could also be altered. "
coronavirus,"To be clear, the House rule does not affect “millions” of Americans. It affects only House lawmakers, aides and visitors to House buildings. "
coronavirus,"As GOP lawmakers fume about how hard it is for them to wear a mask, millions of Americans are facing the possibility of losing their homes starting Saturday, when a federal eviction moratorium is set to run out (and which President Joe Biden decided not to extend). Yet for many Republican members, their top issue was whether or not they personally have to wear a mask at work."
coronavirus,"“We have a crisis at our border and we are playing footsie with mask mandates in the people’s house. It’s absolutely absurd what this body is doing, the people’s house. It’s an embarrassment. It’s a mockery. And the American people are fed up,” Roy said in an impassioned floor speech, implying that the public cares whether lawmakers have to wear masks at work. "
coronavirus,"Republicans went big on dramatic flair, too. On Wednesday, Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) tried to force the House to adjourn for the day in protest of the mask mandate."
coronavirus,"That same day, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) reportedly threw a mask back at a House floor staffer who tried to give her one."
coronavirus,"Republican Reps. Thomas Massie (Ky.), Ralph Norman (S.C.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.) vowed to sue Pelosi over the $500 fines they incurred in May ― before the mask rules were lifted ― for going maskless."
coronavirus,"On Thursday, a group of Republican staffers partied maskless in the Rayburn House Office Building, cramming together in a tight space to play corn hole and beer pong (minus the beer). "
coronavirus,That was the same day that about 40 House Republicans walked over to the Senate side of the U.S. Capitol in protest of the House mask rule since the Senate doesn’t have the same rule. Massie said they were there for a “taste of freedom.” Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Mike Lee (R-Utah) have been parroting the complaints of their House colleagues. 
coronavirus,"And House GOP leaders used their final, major press conference before going on recess to ― you guessed it ― complain again about wearing masks at work. Standing behind a sign that read “Country in Crisis,” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) touched on topics like crime and gas prices but kept coming back to how hard it was to wear a mask. "
coronavirus,"For her part, Pelosi called McCarthy a “moron” in response to his claim that the new House rule is not driven by science and public safety precautions. "
coronavirus,"House Republicans also made a show of outrage over a U.S. Capitol Police flyer telling officers that if visitors to House office buildings or the House side of the Capitol refused to put on a mask, they should be denied entry. "
coronavirus,"“This is not the America we know,” he said. “This is not Pelosi’s house. This is the people’s house.”"
coronavirus,"“Any person who fails to either comply or leave the premises after being asked to do so would be subject to an arrest for Unlawful Entry,” read the flyer, making clear they wouldn’t be arrested but would be “reported to the House Sergeant at Arms’ Office.”"
coronavirus,"Pelosi’s office said it had no control over the Capitol Police’s actions, and the department later clarified that it saw “no reason it should ever come to someone being arrested.” "
coronavirus,"A likely reason Congress’s attending physician recommended that House lawmakers mask up again is because, even as the delta variant of the coronavirus rapidly spreads, dozens of GOP lawmakers are either not vaccinated or won’t say if they are, according to a CNN survey in mid-May. "
coronavirus,"Every single Democratic lawmaker has been vaccinated, according to the same survey."
coronavirus,"Adm. Brett Giroir, the Trump White House’s COVID-19 testing czar, on Friday spelled out what unvaccinated people should expect from the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus."
coronavirus,"“If you are not vaccinated and if you have not had COVID before, you’re going to get the delta variant,” Giroir told CNN’s Chris Cuomo."
coronavirus,"“On average, one person will transmit this to nine people, unlike the original virus, which got transmitted to two or three,” he explained."
coronavirus,Giroir expressed concern over people relying on natural immunity from a previous infection as their sole protection from the disease.
coronavirus,"“Natural immunity is real and it provides protection,” he acknowledged. “But there is more and more accumulated evidence that that immunity wanes and it’s not so good against delta.”"
coronavirus,Giroir’s comments came after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned in internal documents of a change in “the war” against COVID-19 because of the highly infectious delta variant that’s spread nationwide.
coronavirus,"“So I’m very concerned and I do support the recommendations that even if you had COVID, you need to get vaccinated as well,” he added of the shots proven to safely and effectively curb transmission and prevent serious illness."

coronavirus,"In the end, Hadzic was allowed to compete, albeit with certain restrictions: USA Fencing, the sport’s governing body, created a “safety plan” to keep Hadzic away from female competitors and out of the Olympic Village, as first reported by BuzzFeed News. He is staying instead at a hotel 30 minutes away from his teammates, according to BuzzFeed, and flew in on a separate plane. He is also not allowed to practice alongside the women."

coronavirus,TOKYO (AP) — Japan expanded a coronavirus state of emergency to four more areas in addition to Tokyo on Friday following record spikes in infections as the capital hosts the Olympics.
coronavirus,"Tokyo has reported a record increase in cases for three days in a row, including 3,865 on Thursday, before logging another 3,300 on Friday. The cases have doubled since last week, although officials say the surge is unrelated to the Olympics."
coronavirus,"Five other areas, including Hokkaido, Kyoto, Hyogo and Fukuoka, will be placed under less-stringent emergency restrictions."
coronavirus,"Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga declared an emergency in Saitama, Kanagawa and Chiba, near Tokyo, as well as in the western city of Osaka, effective Monday until Aug. 31. Emergency measures already in place in Tokyo and the southern island of Okinawa will be extended until the end of August, after the Olympics and well into the Paralympics which start Aug. 24."
coronavirus,"Officials said 2,995 are hospitalized, about half the current capacity of 6,000 beds, with some hospitals already full. More than 10,000 others are isolating at home or in designated hotels, with nearly 5,600 waiting at home while health centers decide where they will be treated. Tokyo is also setting up a facility for those requiring oxygen while waiting for hospital beds."
coronavirus,"“Infections are expanding in the Tokyo and western metropolitan areas at an enormous speed that we have never experienced before,” Suga said as he declared the expansion of the state of emergency. If the spike continues at the current pace with the spread of the more contagious delta variant, Japan’s medical system could collapse, he said."
coronavirus,"Nationwide, Japan reported 10,687 cases Thursday, exceeding 10,000 for the first time. It has recorded 15,166 fatalities from COVID-19, including 2,288 in Tokyo, since the pandemic began."
coronavirus,"Japan has kept its cases and deaths lower than many other countries, but its seven-day rolling average is growing and now stands at 28 per 100,000 people nationwide and 88 per 100,000 in Tokyo, according to the Health Ministry. This compares to 18.5 in the United States, 48 in Britain and 2.8 in India, according to data from Johns Hopkins University."
coronavirus,"The emergency measures focus on an alcohol ban at eateries and karaoke bars and their shortened hours, but have become less effective because people are only requested to remain and work at home. Many have been defying the measures as they become tired of restrictive life."

coronavirus,"Dr. Priscilla Frase, the chief medical information officer at Ozarks Healthcare in West Plains, said in a video released by the organization this week how one pharmacist leading its vaccine effort told her of several people “who have tried to sort of disguise their appearance” while getting the shot."
coronavirus,"They’ve even gone “so far as to say, ‘Please, please, please don’t let anybody know that I got this vaccine. I don’t want my friends to know. But I don’t want to get COVID. I want to get the vaccine,’” Frase said in the clip."
coronavirus,"Frase told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Thursday that the people she was talking about “had some experience that’s sort of changed their mind” in spite of what family, friends or co-workers think, “and they came to their own decision that they wanted to get a vaccine.”"
coronavirus,"“They did their own research on it, and they talked to people and made the decisions themselves,” Frase continued. “But even though they were able to make that decision for themselves, they didn’t want to have to deal with the peer pressure or the outbursts from other people about them, ‘Giving in to everything.’”"
coronavirus,Daily infections in the state have risen over the last week amid the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus. 
coronavirus,Watch the CNN interview here.
coronavirus,"Missouri has one of the lowest U.S. vaccination rates, with some 41% of its population now fully inoculated. Public health experts and scientists have declared all of the vaccines available in the U.S. as safe and effective, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
coronavirus,President Joe Biden has called on state and local governments to give $100 to those who opt to get a COVID-19 vaccine.
coronavirus,The White House announced the new plan Thursday as the dangerous delta variant continues to spread across the U.S. and some states lag behind in vaccination rates.
coronavirus,The White House said the new plan will incentivize the vaccine-hesitant to go get their shots.
coronavirus,"“When the grocery store Kroger started offering $100 to their associates to get vaccinated, it saw vaccination rates increase from 50% to 75%,” the White House said in a statement. “States like New Mexico, Ohio, and Colorado have piloted $100 incentive programs that have also helped move the dial on vaccinations.”"
coronavirus,"Along with offering $100 to get vaccinated, Biden also announced that small- and medium-sized businesses will be reimbursed for offering paid leave to employees who still need to get vaccinated. "
coronavirus,"“I think less of people who are not vaccinated. I think that it is an arrogant, selfish, reckless act,” Rivera said on Wednesday’s episode of “The Five” during a conversation about so-called vaccine passports and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s revised advice that fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors again amid the spread of the more transmissible delta variant."
coronavirus,Fox News’ Geraldo Rivera called for COVID-19 vaccine mandates during a panel discussion that saw him tell “The Five” co-host Greg Gutfeld that he’d kick him “in the ass” if he went into his grandchildren’s home unvaccinated.
coronavirus,"“I think it is absolutely so selfish, that it is appalling,” he continued. “Sometimes government has to tell, not ask. The government has to tell right now. I want people to have to show, when I go to the bar, I want to know everybody is vaccinated. Or have the test. Here is my negative test, here it is, and every week it has to be updated.”"
coronavirus,"“I have five grandchildren, all under the age of 12, who are susceptible to someone sneezing on them,” said Rivera, referencing his relatives who are too young to receive the shot."
coronavirus,"For all of 2021, the economy is expected to expand about 7%. That would be the strongest calendar-year growth since 1984. And it would mark a sharp reversal from last year’s 3.5% economic contraction — the worst in 74 years — as a result of the pandemic."
coronavirus,"“You know what? Too bad. Too bad. Too bad,” Rivera responded. “If you come into my grandchildren’s house and you are not vaccinated, I’m going to kick you in the ass.”"
coronavirus,"For now, the economy is showing sustained strength. Last month, America’s employers added 850,000 jobs, well above the average of the previous three months. And average hourly pay rose a solid 3.6% compared with a year earlier, faster than the pre-pandemic annual pace."
coronavirus,Gutfeld later told Rivera that “when you call people names” it “doesn’t persuade anybody.”
coronavirus,"Thursday’s report from the Commerce Department estimated that the nation’s gross domestic product — its total output of goods and services — accelerated in the April-June quarter from an already robust 6.3% annual growth rate in the first quarter of the year. The quarterly figure was less than analysts had expected, but the economy was likely held back mainly by supply shortages in goods, components and labor."
coronavirus,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Fueled by vaccinations and government aid, the U.S. economy grew at a solid 6.5% annual rate last quarter in another sign that the nation has achieved a sustained recovery from the pandemic recession."
coronavirus,"“It’s your house. Don’t let them in,” replied Gutfeld."
coronavirus,"Yet overhanging the rosy economic forecasts is the possibility of a resurgent coronavirus in the form of the highly contagious delta variant. The U.S. is now averaging more than 60,000 confirmed new cases a day, up from only about 12,000 a month ago. Should a surge in viral infections cause many consumers to hunker down again and pull back on spending, it would weaken the recovery."
coronavirus,"“The fundamentals for consumers and businesses are still very good,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial, who said he had so far seen no effects from a rise in confirmed viral cases."
coronavirus,"Consumer confidence has reached its highest level since the pandemic struck in March 2020, a key reason why retail sales remain solid as Americans shift their spending back to services — from restaurant meals and airline trips to entertainment events and shopping sprees. Businesses are also showing renewed faith in the economy, with orders for manufactured goods pointing to solid corporate investment."
coronavirus,"The economy is also receiving substantial support from the Federal Reserve. On Wednesday, the Fed reaffirmed that it will maintain its key short-term interest rate at a record low near zero to keep short-term borrowing costs low. It will also continue to buy government-backed bonds to put downward pressure on long-term loan rates to encourage borrowing and spending."
coronavirus,"Underpinning the recovery have been trillions in federal rescue money, ranging from stimulus checks to expanded unemployment benefits to small business aid to just-distributed child tax credit payments. And millions of affluent households have benefited from a vast increase in their wealth resulting from surging home equity and stock market gains."
coronavirus,"The recovery, in fact, has been so rapid, with pent-up demand from consumers driving growth after a year of lockdowns, that one looming risk is a potential spike in inflation that could get out of control. Consumer prices jumped 5.4% in June from a year ago, the sharpest spike in 13 years and the fourth straight month of sizable price jumps."
coronavirus,"But at a news conference Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell underscored his belief that recent inflation readings reflect price spikes in a narrow range of categories — from used cars and airline tickets to hotel rooms and auto rentals — that have been distorted by temporary supply shortages related to the economy’s swift reopening. Those shortages involve items like furniture, appliances, clothing and computer chips, among others."
coronavirus,"Some economists have warned that by choosing not to begin withdrawing its extraordinary support for the economy, the Fed may end up responding too late and too aggressively to high inflation by quickly jacking up rates and perhaps causing another recession."
coronavirus,"Magnifying the supply bottlenecks is a rise in viral cases at transportation ports in Asia that have caused some manufacturing plants to shut down. Those bottlenecks could, in turn, continue to obstruct the flow of goods to retailers in the United States."
coronavirus,"A shortage of workers, too, has made it harder for restaurants, retailers and many other service-industry employers to fill jobs as consumer demand surges — even employers that have been raising wages. Despite the job market’s steady gains, unemployment, at 5.9%, is still well above the 3.5% rate that prevailed before the pandemic struck. And the economy remains 6.8 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic total."
coronavirus,"Should the economy’s shortages persist well into the future, the economy would likely struggle to maintain its current robust pace of growth."
coronavirus,Kendricks’ dad posted on social media that his son had no symptoms but was informed while in Tokyo that he tested positive and was out of the competition.

coronavirus,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) appeared to call House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) a “moron” on Wednesday, and the name instantly began haunting him on social media."
coronavirus,One common image making the rounds was a doctored C-SPAN screenshot that made one small tweak to the lawmaker’s name: 
coronavirus,McCarthy complained that a new mask mandate in the House to prevent the spread of the coronavirus wasn’t about science. He claimed it was a “decision conjured up by liberal government officials who want to continue to live in a perpetual pandemic state.”
coronavirus,"As the nickname took off, #MoronMcCarthy began trending on Twitter:"
coronavirus,"Earlier this week, Dr. Brian Monahan, Congress’ attending physician, ordered all lawmakers ― vaccinated and unvaccinated ― to wear face masks in office buildings, on the House floor and during hearings and meetings. Many Republicans protested against the request."
coronavirus,But it got weird in a hurry when Cuomo asked him if the sign was just a stunt.
coronavirus,"When reporters asked Pelosi about McCarthy’s remarks, she said: “He’s such a moron.”"
coronavirus,"“You’re a smart guy,” Roman said."
coronavirus,"“It’s an IQ test. And like I say to people when they ask me, if they’re so blinded with their rage and their hate I tell them, ‘You know what, if you still don’t understand it, maybe we should put up a sign up that says you’re too stupid to come into the restaurant.’ I mean it’s very simple. Just like you said, I think you figured it out, am I right?”"
coronavirus,"It got even weirder from there, as footage posted online by Raw Story showed: "
coronavirus,"“I don’t even know what you’re saying right now,” Cuomo said. "
coronavirus,"When Cuomo asked if Roman and his family were vaccinated, he admitted they weren’t, then tried to turn the interview back on Cuomo, asking him the same. When Cuomo said he and his family were vaccinated, Roman replied: “You’re failing the IQ test.” "
coronavirus,CNN’s Chris Cuomo tried to interview California restaurant owner Tony Roman on on Wednesday night about the sign he posted telling diners they need to prove they’re not vaccinated to eat at his establishment.
coronavirus,American world champion pole vaulter Sam Kendricks will miss the Olympics after testing positive for COVID-19.
coronavirus,Roman capped his evening by bragging about his bizarre interview on Fox News: 
coronavirus,"Roman ignored coronavirus protections throughout the pandemic and allowed diners to eat inside his restaurant without masks last year at the height of the pandemic, Cerritos Community News reported."
coronavirus,"He’s bragged about fighting the government as well, even though he collected nearly $58,000 in Paycheck Protection Program funds from the government, according to the website."
coronavirus,"“The Daily Show” team is about as sick of the delta variant of the coronavirus as you are, and they’re fighting back the best way they can ― with jokes."

coronavirus,"He jumped from topic to topic to suggest a crisis ― crime, gas prices, border security ― before turning to new guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about wearing masks as the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus spreads around the country. He called the nation’s top public health agency “a political arm” of the Biden administration and said it “wants to control every element of our life.”"
coronavirus,"“We stand out here in front of the Capitol by the chambers of the House, but as you look across on the other steps is the Senate. I’m not quite sure where the CDC got, but somewhere in the middle of that dome, the science changes,” McCarthy said to chuckles from his caucus."
coronavirus,House Republican leaders held a press conference on Thursday to deliver a powerful parting message to America before they head home for a two-month recess: We hate wearing masks at work.
coronavirus,"“The Republican Congress will not allow this to happen,” McCarthy declared."
coronavirus,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) reimposed a mask mandate on Tuesday after Dr. Brian Monahan, Congress’ attending physician, issued new recommendations saying that all House members and staff ― regardless of vaccination status ― must wear a “well-fitted, medical grade, filtration face mask” at work. The Senate’s mask policy is still largely voluntary for now, which House Republicans say isn’t fair since they have to wear masks."
coronavirus,"And then, McCarthy shared how hard it has been for Republicans to put their masks on when they go into the House."
coronavirus,"“We have a country in crisis,” said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.), gathered with GOP lawmakers in front of the Capitol."
coronavirus,"“This is not the America we know,” he added. “This is not Pelosi’s house. This is the people’s house.”"
coronavirus,Rep. Tony Gonzales (R-Texas) said Pelosi wants Republicans to talk about how they have to wear masks at work ― and then went on to talk about it.
coronavirus,"McCarthy said House Republicans “have had enough” and pledged that they will “not allow the CDC to be political,” referring to the agency recommending that people in certain areas wear masks indoors again to protect themselves and others from the delta variant."
coronavirus,"“She wants us to talk about this ridiculous mask mandate,” Gonzales said. “She wants to divide us. But we’re not going to be divided.”"
coronavirus,"Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-Ohio), who reminded people that he is a doctor (he is a podiatrist), complained that he has to wear a mask in the Capitol while residents of Washington, D.C., don’t have to wear masks around the city."
coronavirus,"House Republicans have been melting down ever since the mask requirement was reimposed on Tuesday. Some erupted in yelling and verbal altercations. Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) even tried, unsuccessfully, to get the House to adjourn for the day on Wednesday because he didn’t want to wear a mask."
coronavirus,"Every House and Senate Democrat is vaccinated, according to the same survey."
coronavirus,"For all their complaints, House Republicans will only have to wear masks at work for three days. The House is adjourning on Friday until Sept. 20, so they are going home for nearly two months and will be subject to whatever mask guidelines are in place in their districts."
coronavirus,"A likely reason Congress’ attending physician recommended that House lawmakers wear masks again is because dozens of House Republicans are either not vaccinated or won’t say if they are, per a CNN survey in mid-May."
coronavirus,"“The CDC guidelines and mask mandates being inflicted on the House of Representatives doesn’t match guidelines for D.C.,” said Wenstrup, motioning to people at the GOP’s outdoor event. “Look at you, you’re not wearing masks. Because D.C. is not requiring it because of the CDC guidelines. Yet that is somehow being ignored once you walk into this side of the building.”"
coronavirus,TOKYO (AP) — A Dutch Olympic skateboarder who was put in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19 called the conditions at the hotel “inhuman” on Wednesday.
coronavirus,"“Not having any outside air is so inhuman,” the 31-year-old Jacobs said in a video message posted on Instagram. “It’s mentally super draining ... definitely more than a lot of humans can handle.”"
coronavirus,"Candy Jacobs has been in isolation for eight days and missed the street event in skateboarding’s debut as an Olympic sport. She said she had to force officials to allow her a supervised short break for some fresh air away from her room, where the window doesn’t open."
coronavirus,"Jacobs was removed from the Olympic Village and put in a quarantine facility for people at the Tokyo Games infected with the virus. On her seventh day of isolation, she said she refused to move."
coronavirus,"“Having that first breath of outside air was the saddest and best moment in my life,” Jacobs said."
coronavirus,"After more than seven hours, she said, officials agreed she could stand at an open window under supervision for 15 minutes."
coronavirus,"Although Jacobs didn’t get a chance to compete on Monday, she praised 13-year-old gold medalist Momiji Nishiya of Japan, and said watching the event on TV was “a super-cool distraction” from quarantine."
coronavirus,"“This ride has been the wildest I have ever been on and hopefully never have to go through something like this again,” said Jacobs, who added she is still testing positive for COVID-19."
coronavirus,"Huffman and Donalds got into a yelling match outside the House floor earlier, CNN reported. Huffman, who was wearing a mask, told Donalds that he was selfish for not wearing one."
coronavirus,An in-person clash between Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) and Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) escalated online Wednesday following the Florida Republican’s refusal to adhere to a reinstated mask mandate to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. House.
coronavirus,"Later, on Twitter, Huffman said he had to take a different elevator because an “unvaccinated, defiantly unmasked GOP colleague doesn’t give a sh*t about anyone but himself.”"
coronavirus,The International Olympic Committee and Tokyo organizers did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
coronavirus,"Donalds is unvaccinated and therefore at a much higher risk of contracting, transmitting and becoming seriously ill from COVID-19."
coronavirus,Donalds tweeted five minutes later accusing Huffman of patronizing him for being a “free-thinking American.” He confirmed that he’d told him to mind his business.
coronavirus,"“No, just for being selfish,” Huffman fired back."
coronavirus,"Donalds reportedly yelled back, “Don’t be worried about me! Mind your business!”"
coronavirus,"Donalds declared that the “real epidemic in America” was liberals telling people how to think. The COVID-19 pandemic has killed more than 611,000 people in the U.S. so far."
coronavirus,House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) reimposed the mask mandate Wednesday on the advice of the congressional physician. It followed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation Tuesday that all people wear masks when indoors in high-risk areas. 
coronavirus,"Coronavirus cases have been on the rise again in the U.S., escalated by the delta variant, which makes up more than 80% of cases now, according to the CDC. Though the vast majority of infections are occurring in unvaccinated people, who also account for most of the hospitalizations and deaths, there have been some breakthrough infections in vaccinated people."
coronavirus,"Nonetheless, the change to House policy on masks prompted tantrums from multiple Republican lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.)."
coronavirus,The CDC said it updated its guidance for fully vaccinated people to wear masks in high-risk indoor settings due to new evidence on the effects of the delta variant.
coronavirus,"“He’s such a moron,” the California Democrat told reporters after an event on climate legislation Wednesday."
coronavirus,"Asked to respond to Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy’s rejection of the reimposed mask mandate in the House of Representatives, Speaker Nancy Pelosi didn’t mince words."
coronavirus,"Dr. Brian Monahan, Congress’ attending physician, on Tuesday ordered that all lawmakers, vaccinated and unvaccinated, wear a “well-fitted, medical grade, filtration face mask” in office buildings, on the House floor and during hearings and meetings, after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention once again recommended masks indoors."
coronavirus,"Republicans like McCarthy, the House minority leader, have decried Monahan’s decision to reinstate a mask mandate in the chamber."
coronavirus,Pelosi granted McCarthy the title of “moron” after the California Republican tweeted that the mask mandate was not based in science.
coronavirus,"“Make no mistake — The threat of bringing masks back is not a decision based on science, but a decision conjured up by liberal government officials who want to continue to live in a perpetual pandemic state,” McCarthy said on Tuesday."
coronavirus,"Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff subsequently tweeted that he could not verify Pelosi’s exact comments, but added, “I can confirm that the Speaker believes that saying a mask requirement is ‘not a decision based on science’ is moronic.”"
coronavirus,"“That’s the purview of the Capitol physician, the official capacity, a mandate from him. I have nothing to say about that except we honor it,” Pelosi said Wednesday."
coronavirus,"“If she’s so brilliant, can she explain to me where the science in the building changes between the House and the Senate,” McCarthy told reporters."
coronavirus,"The rise of the delta variant of the coronavirus, which is proving significantly more transmissible than past strains of the virus, has caused a serious increase in cases across the country, particularly ravaging unvaccinated people."
coronavirus,"McCarthy responded to Pelosi’s comment, asking why the mandate is only in the House and not in the Senate."
coronavirus,"Some Republicans are refusing to comply with the mask mandate. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) refused to wear one on the House floor Wednesday, even after a House floor aide offered her one, according to CNN’s Manu Raju. Boebert staff told reporters that she will not “comply with Speaker Pelosi’s anti-science, totalitarian mask mandate.”"
coronavirus,The CDC issued guidance Tuesday recommending that both vaccinated and unvaccinated Americans return to wearing masks in certain public indoor areas.
coronavirus,"Already, members of the House of Representatives and their staff — including vaccinated staffers in Pelosi’s office — have caught the strain."
coronavirus,"Like with past mandates, lawmakers who refuse to wear masks in the House will receive a fine or be denied entry onto the House floor."

coronavirus,"“We know that the Delta variant came into this country and delayed the lifting of some of the restrictions and caused infections here. We need to make sure that we’ve got proper data-driven analysis, and that we look at an international passport for vaccines."
coronavirus,The White House cited the need to keep out the Delta variant of the virus that has swept across the UK and the rest of Europe.
coronavirus,"“And we also know that people who have had the vaccine, of course, can still get the virus, so a testing regime is very important and crucial as well.”"
coronavirus,There is a hope that the shift in recognizing American certification will pave the way for a reciprocal deal that allows fully vaccinated Brits to travel to the U.S. from later this year.
coronavirus,"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has previously pointed out that the U.S.’s lack of a national digital COVID passport presents challenges, especially with several individual states having paper-based records instead."

coronavirus,"“Every American should take advantage of this miracle, and get vaccinated,” McConnell says in the ad, according to a script obtained by HuffPost. “It’s the only way we’re going to defeat COVID. This is not complicated. 97% of people hospitalized for COVID are not vaccinated.”"
coronavirus,"“If you haven’t been vaccinated, do the right thing for you ― for your family ― and get vaccinated right now,” the senator continues. "
coronavirus,McConnell has been one of the most outspoken GOP senators on getting vaccinated to protect against the coronavirus. He was an early voice on the right hailing the vaccine as a lifesaver even as some of his fellow Republicans took a more cautious approach by stressing the decision of whether to get a shot should be left up to individuals.
coronavirus,"A growing number of Republican lawmakers and conservative media personalities have been urging Americans to get vaccinated in recent weeks as the highly contagious delta variant has surged across the country, particularly in red states."
coronavirus,But vaccine hesitancy and skepticism continue to be rampant among a segment of the population. Some GOP lawmakers have stoked opposition to the vaccines by questioning their efficacy and their effects on some people. 
coronavirus,"Asked Tuesday about new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance directing all Americans, regardless of vaccination status, to wear masks in public indoor settings in areas with a high likelihood of virus transmission, a decision some Republicans are protesting, McConnell reiterated his message. “Everybody needs to get vaccinated,” he told HuffPost."

coronavirus,"Experts have warned that the more contagious delta variant could cause a surge during the Olympics, which started Friday."
coronavirus,"Experts noted that cases among younger, unvaccinated people are rising sharply as Japan’s inoculation drive loses steam due to supply uncertainty. Many serious cases involve those in their 50s. They now dominate Tokyo’s nearly 3,000 hospitalized patients and are gradually filling up available beds. Authorities reportedly plan to ask medical institutions to increase their capacity to about 6,000."

coronavirus,President Joe Biden said Tuesday that his administration was mulling the possibility of requiring COVID-19 vaccines for all federal employees.
coronavirus,"Asked during a press conference whether he would impose a vaccine mandate on the federal workforce, Biden said, “That’s under consideration right now.”"
coronavirus,The CDC had previously said that fully vaccinated people could eschew masks — despite World Health Organization advice urging otherwise. But CDC officials said the agency was changing its guidance because of “worrisome” new science about the delta variant.
coronavirus,"“But if you’re not vaccinated, you’re not nearly as smart as I thought you were,” the president added."
coronavirus,"Biden will announce the mandate on Thursday, the network reported. It will require all federal employees and contractors to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo regular testing and other measures, CNN said."
coronavirus,"Biden’s remarks on Tuesday came on the heels of a reversal in mask guidance by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, which said earlier in the day that it now recommended vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas with “substantial” and “high” transmission of the coronavirus. Those descriptions currently apply to more than 60% of all U.S. counties."
coronavirus,"“In recent days, I have seen new scientific data from recent outbreak investigations showing that the delta variant behaves uniquely differently from past strains of the virus that cause COVID-19,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told reporters. “This new science is worrisome and unfortunately warrants an update to our recommendations. This is not a decision that we or CDC has made lightly.” "
coronavirus,"When later pressed as to whether the shifting CDC advice would “sow confusion,” Biden said it was the unvaccinated who were fueling uncertainty."
coronavirus,"“We’d be in a very different world” if unvaccinated Americans chose to get the vaccine, he said."
coronavirus,"“So get vaccinated,” he said."
coronavirus,"CNN, citing a source with direct knowledge of the issue, reported that a vaccine mandate for federal workers was imminent."
coronavirus,"The VA’s move came on a day when nearly 60 leading medical and health care organizations issued a call for health care facilities to require their workers to get vaccinated. No federal law stands in the way of employers requiring vaccinations, but like mask mandates, the issue has been politicized in a society that’s divided on matters of public health."
coronavirus,"“With more than 300 million doses administered in the United States and nearly 4 billion doses administered worldwide, we know the vaccines are safe and highly effective at preventing severe illness and death from COVID-19,” Dr. Susan Bailey, immediate past president of the American Medical Association, said in a statement. “Increased vaccinations among health care personnel will not only reduce the spread of COVID-19 but also reduce the harmful toll this virus is taking within the health care workforce and those we are striving to serve.”"
coronavirus,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The Department of Veterans Affairs on Monday became the first major federal agency to require health care workers to get COVID-19 vaccines, as the aggressive delta variant spreads across the nation and some communities report troubling increases in hospitalizations among unvaccinated people."
coronavirus,"Although vaccination among physicians is nearly universal — 96% according to an AMA survey — that’s not the case for many other people working at health care facilities. In nursing homes, only about 60% of staffers are vaccinated, compared with about 80% of residents, according to recent numbers from Medicare. And COVID-19 cases are rising."
coronavirus,"At the VA, vaccines will now be mandatory for certain medical personnel — including physicians, dentists, podiatrists, optometrists, registered nurses, physician assistants and others who work in departmental facilities or provide direct care to veterans, said VA Secretary Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough."
coronavirus,"“It’s the best way to keep veterans safe, especially as the delta variant spreads across the country,” McDonough said in a statement. “Whenever a veteran or VA employee sets foot in a VA facility, they deserve to know that we have done everything in our power to protect them from COVID-19."
coronavirus,Employees will have eight weeks to be fully vaccinated.
coronavirus,"In addition to the AMA, the medical and health care groups calling for mandatory vaccines for health workers included the American Academy of Nursing, the American Public Health Association, the American Pharmacists Association and, for the first time, a nursing home industry group. LeadingAge, which represents nonprofit nursing homes and elder care facilities, had previously advocated educating nursing home employees about the benefits of getting their shots. Also joining the call was the National Medical Association, the leading professional group representing Black physicians."
coronavirus,"It was unclear what would happen to VA employees who refuse to be vaccinated. The agency said vaccination will be required “absent a medical or religious exemption.” The longstanding policy in the health care industry is for staff to stay up-to-date with vaccinations, such as annual flu shots. Exceptions for medical reasons include known allergies."
coronavirus,"“With this mandate, we can once again make — and keep — that fundamental promise,” he added."
coronavirus,"To make matters more complicated, the COVID-19 vaccines have yet to win full approval from the Food and Drug Administration. They continue to be provided under emergency use authorization and the lack of a full approval has fed into hesitancy among some people."
coronavirus,"“Unfortunately, many health care and long-term care personnel remain unvaccinated,” the groups said in a statement. “We stand with the growing number of experts and institutions that support the requirement for universal vaccination of health workers.”"
coronavirus,"The COVID-19 vaccines were not brewed overnight, either. They were the fruit of more than 10 years of behind-the-scenes research and huge injections of funding that laid the groundwork for them to be rolled out so quickly."
coronavirus,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has heavily promoted vaccinations as a way to slow the pandemic and save lives. However, the agency has not recommended that state or local officials, or employers, mandate vaccinations for their employees."
coronavirus,"Earlier this year, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission said current federal laws do not prevent an employer from requiring employees physically entering the workplace to be vaccinated against COVID-19."
coronavirus,"“The politics is really tricky because President Biden hasn’t ordered mandatory vaccinations for federal workers,” said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University. “And it would seem hypocritical if CDC made that recommendation” to businesses or state and local officials, he said."
coronavirus,A CDC spokeswoman would not comment.
coronavirus,"Katie Smith Sloan, CEO of LeadingAge, said it’s time to go beyond the power of persuasion. “As COVID-19 variants emerge and proliferate, we can start saving more lives today by ensuring staff are fully vaccinated,” she said."
coronavirus,AP writers Hope Yen in Washington and Mike Stobbe in New York contributed.
coronavirus,"Still, the FDA’s emergency approval process was thorough and didn’t skip the extensive testing required of any vaccine. Of the three manufacturers of vaccines approved in the U.S., Pfizer and Moderna have applied for full approval, and a Pfizer decision is expected soon."
coronavirus,SAN DIEGO (AP) — An unvaccinated snow leopard at the San Diego Zoo has contracted COVID-19.
coronavirus,"However, Ramil had not been vaccinated before his infection."
coronavirus,"In January, a troop of eight gorillas at the zoo’s sister facility, San Diego Zoo Safari Park, contracted COVID-19 from a keeper who had the virus but showed no symptoms."
coronavirus,It’s unclear how Ramil got infected.
coronavirus,"There is no vaccine mandate for the staff, but unvaccinated employees are required to wear masks at all times, the zoo said."
coronavirus,"The gorilla troop, which has since recovered, became the first known example of the virus infecting apes."
coronavirus,"The case prompted the zoo to request an experimental COVID-19 vaccine for animals for emergency use. The vaccine from Zoetis, animal health company that was once part of Pfizer, was administered to species most at risk of contracting COVID-19, including several primates and big cats."
coronavirus,"Caretakers noticed that Ramil, a 9-year-old male snow leopard, had a cough and runny nose on Thursday. Later, two separate tests of his stool confirmed the presence of the coronavirus, the zoo said in a statement Friday."
coronavirus,"Ramil is not showing additional symptoms, the zoo said, but because he shares an enclosure with a female snow leopard and two Amur leopards, the staff assumes they have been exposed. As a result, the animals were quarantined and their exhibit was closed."
coronavirus,"Just three states ― Florida, Texas and Missouri ― accounted for 40% of all new cases over the past week, White House COVID-19 response coordinator Jeffrey Zients said Thursday. All have comparatively low inoculation rates. "
coronavirus,"“The threat is now predominantly only to the unvaccinated,” Zients said."
coronavirus,"One in five new cases was in Florida alone, for the second week in a row. The Sunshine State recently documented its highest daily number of new cases since late January, with 12,647 recorded on Wednesday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
coronavirus,"“People in these states are feeling the impact of being unvaccinated and responding with action,” Zients said. "
coronavirus,"The SBT Brasil journalist commentated as he received the shot as if it was a soccer game. And he celebrated the needle going into his arm as if it was an epic goal, to the laughter of the woman administering the jab. "
coronavirus,"The vast majority of new infections, hospitalizations and deaths are now occurring in unvaccinated people; infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said earlier this month that more than 99% of recent deaths are among the unvaccinated."
coronavirus,"The Biden administration said Thursday it would be sending an additional $100 million to rural health clinics to help support vaccination efforts; the administration sent $400 million to around 1,500 rural hospitals to increase testing."
coronavirus,"Zients credited the effectiveness of the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines ― all currently available under an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration ― for changing the course of the pandemic."
coronavirus,"In Alabama, which is also recording new cases at the same rate as it did in late January, Republican Gov. Kay Ivey declared Thursday that “it’s time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks, not the regular folks” for “letting us down.”"
coronavirus,"Ivey appeared frustrated when a reporter asked what could be done to encourage more Alabamans to get their shots, saying, “I don’t know. You tell me. Folks supposed to have common sense.”"
coronavirus,"Driving the surge is the delta variant of the coronavirus, which is even more transmissible than the original variant. It is believed to have evolved during unchecked COVID-19 spread in India. The more a virus spreads, the more opportunity it has to mutate ― potentially leading to more harmful versions. "
coronavirus,"Overall, states in the Northeast are doing the best job distributing the shots ― Vermont is approaching 70% of its population being fully vaccinated ― while the South and parts of the West struggle to convince people to get the jab. Texas and Missouri lag behind much of the country in vaccinations, with 43% and 40% of their respective populations fully inoculated. Florida is squarely in the middle, with 48% fully inoculated, according to CDC data."
coronavirus,"He noted one positive trend: In places where cases are increasing more rapidly than the national average, vaccination rates are also increasing more rapidly than average, namely in Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Missouri and Nevada. "
coronavirus,Brazilian sportscaster Leandro Chaves put a match-winning spin on his COVID-19 vaccination.
coronavirus,"And she revealed how she now flips the vitriol back on the conspiracy theorists who think the public health crisis isn’t real and doubt the efficacy of the vaccines, even as cases again rise with the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant and 99.5% of American deaths are now among the unvaccinated."
coronavirus,"It was the “most important and emotional” commentary of his life, Chaves wrote on Twitter, where he also hailed Brazilian science, journalism and the country’s publicly funded health care system."
coronavirus,"“I’ve made about $100,” she claimed."
coronavirus,"“I get called a crisis actor all the time. It’s my thing now to respond to hate comments with, ‘For just $10 into my Venmo account I’ll tell you the truth about COVID-19 and crisis acting,’” Sunny told CNN’s Elle Reeve."

coronavirus, And the truth that she’s promised?
coronavirus,"“I’m just like, ‘Crisis acting isn’t real and COVID is real, so, like surprise,’” Sunny said. “Said I’d tell you the truth, not the truth you want to hear.” "
coronavirus,"In a segment that aired on Friday’s broadcast of “Anderson Cooper 360” on CNN, the health care worker called Sunny recalled just some of the abuse she has received while working in a coronavirus unit on the front lines of the pandemic."
coronavirus,"Hospitalizations in some areas increased at the fastest rate since the start of the pandemic, according to data analyzed by the Wall Street Journal."
coronavirus,"“All of those things together are a recipe for the data that we’re seeing,” Jason Salemi, an epidemiologist at the University of South Florida, told the Journal. “It’s a cause for concern ... the speed with which the indicators are going up.”"
coronavirus,"The astonishing uptick in Florida cases — from some 46,000 to 73,000 this past week to Thursday — was linked to the state’s lackluster vaccination rate, dropped health protocols requiring masks and social distancing, and more people moving indoors to escape the summer heat, according to epidemiologists."
coronavirus,Florida once again led the nation this week in the number of soaring cases of COVID-19 as the dangerous delta variant sweeps through the country.
coronavirus,"The age of those hospitalized in Florida is also ticking downward: 53% are under age 60, compared with 30% at the start of the year, the Journal reported."
coronavirus,Florida was still racking up one of every five cases in the country — just as it did the previous week when the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned of the rising “pandemic of the unvaccinated.”
coronavirus,Experts continue to emphasize that vaccinations are the most effective weapon against COVID-19. A British study published Wednesday found that the Pfizer vaccine was 88% effective against symptomatic cases of the delta variant.
coronavirus,"The state’s governor, Republican Ron DeSantis, also consistently resists safety measures and downplays the threat of the disease. Florida is among a handful of states cutting back on how often it reports cases. The state has joined Nebraska, Iowa and South Dakota in only reporting cases weekly, rather than daily, as most other states do. Some states are expanding reporting, such as specifying the number of cases for the vaccinated vs. unvaccinated. Hospitalizations in Florida hit 3,849 on July 17, the highest since late February, according to the Journal."
coronavirus,The study reportedly involved a relatively small sample of cases. Yet the range of figures is raising some fears that vaccines’ efficacy may be fading over time — or that the delta variant is presenting a powerful challenge to vaccinations. The increasing number of cases is also raising discussions about the need for a booster.
coronavirus,"“We have to be mindful that, with time, the effectiveness of these vaccines may wane,” Dr. Isaac Bogoch, an infectious disease professor at the University of Toronto, told CNBC."
coronavirus,"But troubling figures from Israel’s Health Ministry concluded Thursday that the Pfizer vaccine was only 39% effective in warding off all COVID-19 infections (40% against symptomatic cases) between June 20 and July 17. That compares to a 95% rate from January to April. Pfizer, however, remained 91% effective in both time frames in preventing severe cases."
coronavirus,"“We have to be prepared ... that people may need a booster at some point,” he added. “This close surveillance that’s happening in countries like Israel, the U.K. and other parts of the world is going to be very helpful in driving policy if and when we do need boosters.”"
coronavirus,White House chief medical officer Dr. Anthony Fauci has already encouraged fully vaccinated people to consider wearing masks indoors as a precaution against the delta variant.
coronavirus,"
“The longer we go with large numbers of people unvaccinated, the greater and greater the risk that a new variant will develop that will evade vaccine-induced immunity,” warned Mayo Clinic Dr. Gregory Poland, one of the nation’s top vaccine experts. “We are our own worst enemies here.”
World Health Organization officials have also warned that the longer people remain unvaccinated as social mixing continues, the higher the risk of an even more dangerous variant.
There were 360,000 new cases of COVID-19 nationwide last week, a 65% increase over the previous week, and nearly triple the number the week before that, CNBC reported. Cases are up in all 50 states.

coronavirus,"Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, issued a stark warning Thursday about the spread of the delta strain of COVID-19, saying the variant is one of the “most infectious respiratory viruses” scientists know of."
coronavirus,"The dire message comes amid urgency from public health officials that Americans get vaccinated. The CDC said earlier this week that cases of the delta strain now make up about 83% of new infections in the U.S., and a majority of deaths from the disease are among unvaccinated people. "
coronavirus,"The strain is much more transmissible than the alpha strain, or the initial version of COVID-19, and has led to surging case numbers in every state in the nation. The number of new cases has risen almost 250% since the beginning of July, and states with low vaccination rates, including Florida, Texas and Missouri, are experiencing some of the worst outbreaks."
coronavirus,"“Compared to the virus we had circulating initially in the United States at the start of the pandemic, the delta variant is more aggressive and much more transmissible than previously circulating strains,” Walensky said at a press briefing. “It is one of the most infectious respiratory viruses we know of and that I have seen in my 20-year career.” "
coronavirus,"Vaccination remains the best defense against severe illness and death from COVID-19, even for those infected with the delta variant. But less than half of the nation is fully vaccinated, and the rise in new infections has prompted several counties to reinstate mask mandates in an attempt to stop the spread of transmission."
coronavirus,"Walensky said last week about 97% of people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 have not been vaccinated, describing the situation as a “pandemic of the unvaccinated.” "
coronavirus,"She added Thursday that, despite gains in vaccination and a return to normal in many states, the country was “not out of the woods yet,” and citizens still needed to make thoughtful decisions to protect themselves and their families."

coronavirus,"TOKYO (AP) — Disputed, locked down and running a year late, the Tokyo Games begin at last on Friday night, a multinational showcase of the finest athletes of a world fragmented by disease — and an event steeped in the political and medical baggage of a relentless pandemic whose presence haunts every Olympic corner."
coronavirus,"As the first pandemic Games in a century convene largely without spectators and opposed by much of the host nation, the disbelief and anger of those kept outside the near-deserted national stadium threaten to drown out the usual carefully packaged glitz and soaring rhetoric about sports and peace that are the hallmarks of the opening ceremony."
coronavirus,"“‘The festival of peace’ is now starting in an unimaginably disastrous state,” the Asahi newspaper said in an editorial, citing “confusion, distrust and unease.”"
coronavirus,"Hand in hand with this feeling of calamity is a fundamental question about these Games as Japan, and large parts of the world, reel from the continuing gut punch of a pandemic that is stretching well into its second year, with cases in Tokyo approaching record highs this week: Will it be enough?"
coronavirus,"“It,” in this case, is the product that’s being packaged and sold, the commodity that has saved past Olympics when they’ve become mired in problems: the deep, intrinsic human attachment to the spectacle of sporting competition at the highest possible level."
coronavirus,"Time and again, previous opening ceremonies have pulled off something that approaches magic. Scandals — bribery in Salt Lake City, censorship and pollution in Beijing, doping in Sochi — fade into the background when the sports begin."
coronavirus,"But with people still falling ill and dying each day from the coronavirus, there’s a particular urgency to the questions about whether the Olympic flame can burn away the fear or provide a measure of catharsis — and even awe — after a year of suffering and uncertainty in Japan and around the world."
coronavirus,"The sports have already begun — softball and soccer, for example — and some of the focus is turning toward the competition to come."
coronavirus,"Can the U.S. women’s soccer team, for instance, even after an early, shocking loss to Sweden, become the first to win an Olympics following a World Cup victory? Can Japan’s Hideki Matsuyama win gold in golf after becoming the first Japanese player to win the Masters? Will Italy’s Simona Quadarella challenge American standout Katie Ledecky in the 800- and 1,500-meter freestyle swimming races?"
coronavirus,"For now, however, it’s hard to miss how unusual these Games promise to be. The lovely national stadium is an isolated militarized zone, surrounded by huge barricades. Roads around it are sealed and businesses closed."
coronavirus,"Inside, the feeling of sanitized, locked-down quarantine carries over. Fans, who would normally be screaming for their countries and mixing with people from around the world, have been banned, leaving only a carefully screened contingent of journalists, officials, athletes and participants."
coronavirus,"Olympics often face opposition, but there’s also usually a pervasive feeling of national pride. Japan’s resentment centers on the belief that it was strong-armed into hosting — forced to pay billions and risk the health of a largely unvaccinated, deeply weary public — so the IOC can collect its billions in media revenue."
coronavirus,"“Sometimes people ask why the Olympics exist, and there are at least two answers. One is they are a peerless global showcase of the human spirit as it pertains to sport, and the other is they are a peerless global showcase of the human spirit as it pertains to aristocrats getting luxurious hotel rooms and generous per diems,” Bruce Arthur, a sports columnist for the Toronto Star, wrote recently."
coronavirus,How did we get here? A quick review of the past year and a half seems operatic in its twists and turns.
coronavirus,"A once-in-a-century pandemic forces the postponement of the 2020 version of the Games. A fusillade of scandals (sexism and other discrimination and bribery claims, overspending, ineptitude, bullying) unfolds. People in Japan, meanwhile, watch bewildered as an Olympics considered a bad idea by many scientists actually takes shape."
coronavirus,"“We will continue to try to have this dialogue with the Japanese people knowing we will not succeed 100%. That would be putting the bar too high,” said IOC President Thomas Bach. “But we’re also confident that once the Japanese people see the Japanese athletes performing in these Olympic Games — hopefully successfully — that then the attitude will become less emotional.”"
coronavirus,"Japanese athletes, freed from onerous travel rules and able to train more normally, may indeed enjoy a nice boost over their rivals in some cases, even without fans. Judo, a sport that Japan is traditionally a powerhouse in, will begin Saturday, giving the host nation a chance for early gold."
coronavirus,"Still, while it’s possible that “people may come out of the Olympics feeling good about themselves and about Japan having hosted the Games against all odds,” Koichi Nakano, a political science professor at Sophia University in Tokyo, believes that such a scenario “is way too optimistic.”"
coronavirus,"For a night, at least, the glamor and message of hope of the opening ceremonies may distract many global viewers from the surrounding anguish and anger."
coronavirus,"The reality, for now, is that the delta variant of the virus is still rising, straining the Japanese medical system in places, and raising fears of an avalanche of cases. Only a little over 20% of the population is fully vaccinated. And there have been near daily reports of positive virus cases within the so-called Olympic bubble that’s meant to separate the Olympic participants from the worried, skeptical Japanese population."
coronavirus,"“But for the Japanese people, who will have a much more direct experience and feel more viscerally the empty stadiums and the strange contrast between this spectacle and their own continued struggles with controlling the pandemic, it may not have the same impact,” said Daniel Sneider, a lecturer in East Asian Studies at Stanford University."

coronavirus,"He added: “This is a serious, current and present danger to you and your families’ health if you are not vaccinated.”"
coronavirus,"Poland, who wears a mask indoors and outside in crowded conditions, warned the unvaccinated: “Do not be deceived that ‘I got this far and I’m OK.’ This is a very different variant. It will find you. This virus will find everybody who is not immune.”"
coronavirus,"Though the major risk is to the unvaccinated, continuing numbers of those who don’t get the protection present a risk to everyone, he warned."
coronavirus,"“The longer we go with large numbers of people unvaccinated, the greater and greater the risk that a new variant will develop that will evade vaccine-induced immunity. So we are our own worst enemies here,” Poland told KARE-11 TV. in Minneapolis."
coronavirus,"He strongly agrees with the recommendation of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week that children should wear a mask when they return to school, whether they’re vaccinated or not."
coronavirus,"Poland is especially worried about children too young to get the vaccine — as well as for teens whose parents are on the fence about vaccinations, especially because “we are seeing rises in severe disease and hospitalization among young people,” he said."
coronavirus,"“A mask is not a political symbol. It is a medical symbol of taking care of yourself and others,” he said."
coronavirus,"Over the week ending Tuesday, the U.S. has averaged 239 deaths per day from the virus — which is nearly a 48% increase from the prior week."
coronavirus,"The significantly more transmissible delta variant now makes up about 83% of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S., with the majority of deaths occurring in unvaccinated people. The variant is driving cases up in every state in the nation."
coronavirus,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) wouldn’t reveal on Wednesday if she had been vaccinated, claiming even asking her was a violation of her HIPAA rights. Seth Meyers wants her to know “that’s not a thing.”"
coronavirus,Greene accused a reporter of violating her HIPAA rights during a press conference when he asked her if she had been vaccinated for the coronavirus.
coronavirus,Check out a clip of Poland’s interview with WCCO-TV below. An extended interview with KARE-11 TV is up top.
coronavirus,The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) applies to health care entities that have access to medical records. It gives individuals the right to decide who can access their health information. It doesn’t stop a reporter from asking about vaccination status or prevent a person from answering the question.
coronavirus,"“I doubt she even knows what HIPAA is or what it stands for. She probably doesn’t even know it’s an acronym,” he said."
coronavirus,"“She probably also thinks Miranda rights means she doesn’t have to visit her friends in Manhattan anymore after she moves to Brooklyn with Steve,” added Meyers, who is apparently a “Sex and the City” fan."
coronavirus,She never answered the question. 
coronavirus,"“A reporter asking you if you’ve been vaccinated doesn’t violate your HIPAA rights any more than a neighbor needs a warrant to enter your house for a barbecue,” Meyers said on “Late Night.”"

coronavirus,"In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, many states and local governments temporarily suspended debt collection to ease the financial burden on struggling businesses and families. But one little-known practice has continued mostly unabated: deducting money from tax refunds to collect delinquent debts."
coronavirus,"Last year, seven of the most populous states in the country — California, Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania — collected more than $728 million combined from state tax refunds, according to garnishment data obtained by the Center for Public Integrity."
coronavirus,"The garnishments take a huge toll on marginalized communities, said Shama Mounzer, executive director of integration at the Wayne Metropolitan Community Action Agency, a Detroit-based nonprofit that serves low- and moderate-income residents with financial needs."
coronavirus,"Michigan, which collected $136.5 million in 2020, had the highest garnishment rate of $13,546 per 1,000 residents — followed by Ohio, which collected $10,161 per 1,000 residents. In three states — Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio — more state tax refunds were garnished last year than in 2019, a Public Integrity analysis shows."
coronavirus,"And the garnishments appear to have been hitting the poor and people of color the hardest, trapping them deeper in the cycle of debt."
coronavirus,"In virtually all states that levy a personal income tax, this practice, known as the “garnishments,” has been deployed on thousands of tax refunds — along with lottery winnings and stimulus checks, among others — during the pandemic-driven recession."
coronavirus,"A case in point: In 2020, the Illinois state comptroller’s office collected nearly $11.5 million from state tax refunds from Chicago residents at the request of the city. A Public Integrity analysis of census and Illinois tax refund data found that the garnishment rate was higher in ZIP codes with higher Black populations or more people living below the poverty threshold."
coronavirus,"“They look forward to their tax refunds every single year and already have plans for [how to use] them,” Mounzer said about many of Wayne Metro’s clients. “When they see the garnishments, it’s a big hit for them.”"
coronavirus,"With the court’s approval, private parties can also have tax refunds garnished on their behalf."
coronavirus,"The bulk of the debts collected by the garnishments are owed to the states and, in some cases, to local governments and courts — ranging from unpaid taxes, child-support obligations and overpayments of unemployment benefits to parking tickets, traffic fines, and other court-related fees and fines."
coronavirus,"“In the face of the pandemic, trying to collect money now from people — when this is the exact same population that has been harmed both in terms of COVID-19 and the economic crisis — is not just cruel but impossible,” Weiss said. “There simply is no more money.”"
coronavirus,"Across the country, many states, local governments and courts have long turned to the fee-and-fine system as a handy revenue source that can help fill budget gaps, even in lean times."
coronavirus,But studies have shown that fees and fines disproportionately strain the lives of people in marginalized communities — even leading to the suspension of their driver’s licenses for nonpayment.
coronavirus,"In Michigan, the garnishment of tax refunds has proved so popular and effective that a local court official has even created a step-by-step guide to help others request it from the state’s treasury department."
coronavirus,Struggling to make ends meet
coronavirus,"Given its “regressive” impacts, the garnishments should be stopped, said Joanna Weiss, co-director of the Fines & Fees Justice Center, a New York-based nonprofit that calls for monetary sanctions reform in the criminal justice system."
coronavirus,"Still, the trend has accelerated, especially in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis in 2008. In the process, the garnishment of tax refunds has emerged as one of the most reliable ways to collect delinquent debts."
coronavirus,"In February, the California Franchise Tax Board announced it had suspended the practice, except for collecting child-support obligations. The move is similar to the temporary suspension the agency put in place at the beginning of the pandemic last year."
coronavirus,But the pandemic prompted officials in two states to rethink the whole idea.
coronavirus,"“The ongoing public health emergency continues to have a severe economic impact on many Californians,” State Controller Betty Yee said in a statement announcing the suspension, which lasts through July 31. “We hope this suspension will offer additional relief for taxpayers.”"
coronavirus,"According to Mendoza’s office, the suspension would spare some 41,000 households an estimated $15 million this year."
coronavirus,"In announcing her decision, Mendoza noted the disproportionate impacts the garnishments have on the poor. “Although families qualifying for the state earned income tax credit are only about 15% of the state population, they account for 36% of the money withheld from income tax refunds,” she said in a statement. “So, yes, these fines and fees hit them harder.”"
coronavirus,"The suspension, which lasts until the end of this year, came after months of lobbying by local advocates — and stories by The Chicago Reporter and Type Investigations that examined the garnishments’ impacts in Illinois."
coronavirus,"“Our drive now is to make this permanent,” Grillier said. “The whole premise of this work is to not build municipalities’ budgets on the backs of people who are already struggling, particularly the poor or people in financially challenged communities.”"
coronavirus,"In Illinois, State Comptroller Susana Mendoza followed suit in March with a limited suspension that applies to “working class” taxpayers who qualify for the state’s earned income tax credit — amounting to income of up to $56,844 a year for a family of four or $15,820 for an individual."
coronavirus,"Local advocates see the suspension as something to build on. “My initial reaction was, ‘This is a great place to start.’ And I emphasize ‘start’ because it’s just a start,” said Rose Grillier, co-president emeritus of POWER-PAC IL, a membership group organized by Community Organizing and Family Issues, a Chicago-based nonprofit that has spearheaded the efforts to reform the fee-and-fine system in Illinois."
coronavirus,"Advocates in other states are pushing for a similar suspension, but some see it as an uphill battle at a time when COVID-19 infection rates are down and the economy shows signs of recovery."
coronavirus,"But Mounzer of Wayne Metro said many people are still as desperate as ever for help. “I do not see a decrease in needs. It’s an increase in needs for every program we’re running here,” she said. “We have a long list of applicants waiting to be processed every day. I’m talking about thousands of applications, just for rental assistance.”"
coronavirus,"“Those needs are probably even greater because what we’re now facing is the accumulation of debts,” said Brown, who lobbied state officials — albeit unsuccessfully — to prevent stimulus checks from being garnished in Michigan. “We have so many people who are behind in rent in our eviction diversion program. It’s unbelievable.”"
coronavirus,"Lorray Brown, co-managing attorney at the Michigan Poverty Law Program, said many of her clients are expecting tax refunds to help with their rent or mortgage."
coronavirus,"If the garnishments must continue, there should at least be a system in place that takes into account people’s ability to pay, said Elisa Della-Piana, legal director at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area."
coronavirus,"But some officials say that, unlike their counterparts in California and Illinois, they have no authority to unilaterally suspend the garnishments in their states."
coronavirus,"Ron Leix, spokesman for the Michigan Department of Treasury, noted that many garnishments are based on court orders. “We don’t have the authority to decline to execute or enforce them,” he said. “So any relief from the garnishment process would have to come from the Legislature, and they’ve taken no action.”"
coronavirus,"Weiss of the Fines & Fees Justice Center wants to see alternatives to fees and fines, particularly in the criminal justice context, to reduce the debt burden. Community service, for instance, could be imposed in lieu of fines, she said."
coronavirus,"“We have so many people who cannot afford these fines and fees that we have to do more and more draconian things to try to collect money from people who don’t have any,” Weiss said. “That makes no sense. We should be ending any collection practices that are causing more harm than good.”"
coronavirus,"“In North Carolina, the Department of Revenue administers the tax law as enacted by the legislature and the governor and, as a matter of policy, does not take policy positions,” said Schorr Johnson, spokesman for the North Carolina Department of Revenue. “The department does not have the authority to suspend refund garnishments under current state law.”"
coronavirus,"“With wage garnishments, at least here in California, there are some protections that people can get. Their money won’t be taken out of their wages if they need the money for basic life necessities — for housing, for food or for a family,” Della-Piana said. “But that inquiry is wholly absent from tax refund intercepts — which is a significant problem.”"
coronavirus,“Why is she trying to do the work of the Chinese communist party in covering this up?” asked Scalise.
coronavirus,"When the Republican lawmakers did talk about the need to get vaccinated, they framed it as a personal decision rather than an imperative in the midst of a deadly pandemic."
coronavirus,"Several high-profile Republicans have recently embraced the coronavirus vaccine, finally getting their shots or encouraging others to get theirs. "
coronavirus,"Fox News host Sean Hannity, who previously called COVID-19 a “hoax,” promoted the vaccine on his show this week. House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (La.) received the shot this week after saying months ago that he would be getting it “soon.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been urging Floridians to get vaccinated. And Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) has repeatedly encouraged vaccinations in recent days. "
coronavirus,"House Republicans gathered for a news conference with doctors Thursday morning, which was billed as a push to get more Americans vaccinated and to discuss the new delta variant, which is more contagious and spreading rapidly around the country. But they spent most of their time blaming China for creating an “evil virus,” as Scalise put it, and criticizing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) for not doing enough to examine its origins."
coronavirus,And some other Republicans aren’t quite ready to ditch the doubt and skepticism they’ve sown in the public about the danger of the virus and the effectiveness of the vaccines. 
coronavirus,"“I don’t think we shifted in our tone,” he said, explaining that the rapid development of the vaccine has always been a top Republican achievement under former President Donald Trump. "
coronavirus,"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that anyone eligible for the vaccine get the shot as soon as possible, not just people who are at higher risk of illness. "
coronavirus,"“We urge all Americans to talk to their doctors about the risks of COVID, talk to their doctors of the benefits of getting vaccinated and then come to a decision that’s right for them about the vaccine,” said Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), a doctor and co-chair of the House Republican Doctors Caucus. “If you are at risk, you should be getting this vaccine.”"
coronavirus,But House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) rejected the idea Thursday that Republicans have been speaking differently about vaccines.
coronavirus,"Rep. Richard Hudson (R-N.C.), who got the shot as soon as he could earlier this year, said he didn’t think there was necessarily more enthusiasm for the vaccine within the House Republican conference because of the delta variant. "
coronavirus,"Scalise told HuffPost he hadn’t gotten vaccinated until now because he’d previously tested positive for antibodies ― meaning he thought he had some protection from COVID-19 from a mild or asymptomatic prior infection ― but with the new variant spreading, he decided to get vaccinated."
coronavirus,"Republicans have been far less likely to get vaccinated than Democrats, according to survey data. Polling also shows that doctors are the most trusted source of vaccine information and that unvaccinated adults put relatively more trust in doctors than in the government, which is likely why elected Republicans are telling people to talk to their doctors when they promote the vaccine. "
coronavirus,"Though Scalise attended the news conference that strayed from its advertised vaccine-boosting message, earlier this week he posed for a photo while finally getting his shot. "
coronavirus,"“I’ve talked to the hospital directors in my state, and over 98% of the people that are being admitted to hospitals right now for COVID are unvaccinated,” he said, “and I just felt this was the right time to get that extra level of protection and also thought it was important to publicly encourage people.”"
coronavirus,"“If you weren’t scared of the original COVID, you shouldn’t be scared of the delta,” Hudson told HuffPost. “I think most of the outbreak we’re seeing is non-vaccinated people, but even among the non-vaccinated, the hospitalization and death rates are extremely low.”"
coronavirus,"“Ultimately it’s everybody’s choice and, you know, if they have questions, talk to their doctor, but at the same time it’s safe and effective and I’m glad I got it,” he added. "
coronavirus,"Rep. Joe Wilson (R-S.C.) also said he didn’t think there’s been any increase in pro-vaccine sentiment among Republicans, though he said he had gotten his shot immediately. "
coronavirus,"Hudson added: “I do see, from the left, kind of a growing hysteria about the variant, which is concerning.” "
coronavirus,"“It’s no change. I’m still thrilled,” he said. “It’s the success of Mike Pence and Operation Warp Speed.”"
coronavirus,"“Seems to me both Republican elected officials and some conservative news people are talking about having vaccines that weren’t a couple of weeks ago,” Blunt told reporters. "
coronavirus,"The Clark County Commission voted on Tuesday to require masks for all employees who work in indoor public places, regardless of whether they’ve been vaccinated. Commissioners reached the decision after they considered the virus’s potential effects on local business and hospitals if cases were to rise."
coronavirus,"Even if most Republicans aren’t publicly admitting that there’s a shift, the highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus seems to have people nervous, according to GOP strategists. The stock market recently tumbled amid concerns about the virus’s resurgent spread, and there are fears of returning to the lockdowns and restrictions of the past year. "
coronavirus,Cases are also on the rise in unvaccinated areas ― including many districts represented by Republicans in Congress. That reality may be prompting some lawmakers to push vaccinations with more urgency.
coronavirus,Blunt suggested the rise of the delta variant could explain the rhetorical change and noted the available vaccines work well against the newer strain of the virus. 
coronavirus,"For example, in Plaquemines Parish in Scalise’s district, there has been a 929% increase in COVID-19 cases over a recent 14-day stretch and a 57% jump in hospitalizations. "
coronavirus,Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said there indeed had been a shift. 
coronavirus,"“One of these days, if we’re not careful,” he said, “we’re going to get a variant that isn’t something that we can handle with the vaccine we’ve already got.”"
coronavirus,"Las Vegas workers are being ordered to mask up as coronavirus cases once again rise across the region largely due to the more contagious delta variant, while tourists and other members of the public are controversially omitted from the requirement."
coronavirus,CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified Richard Hudson as from New York rather than North Carolina. It also referred to Mitch McConnell as the Senate majority leader; he is minority leader.
coronavirus,"“You don’t just let the crisis just linger for a while until you come up with the perfect solution,” Commissioner Jim Gibson said during the emergency meeting that featured heated comments from pro- and anti-mask community members. “We’ve got to do something.”"
coronavirus,"The delta variant currently makes up the majority of southern Nevada’s new COVID-19 cases, and vaccination rates are plateauing, “which is driving the increase in cases here,” Dr. Cort Lohff, chief medical officer at the Southern Nevada Health District, told commissioners at Tuesday’s meeting."
coronavirus,"As cases again rise throughout the country, the White House recently identified the Las Vegas metro area as the fourth worst in the nation for coronavirus transmission among metro areas containing more than 1 million people. There, 16% of lab tests from July 10-16 were positive for the virus, according to the White House COVID-19 team’s latest community profile report. The top three metro areas were all in Florida: Jacksonville, Orlando and Miami."
coronavirus,"Lohff said requiring everyone to wear a mask “might obviously be more effective” than only requiring indoor workers to, but that “either way, either one of those two measures, I think, will be effective in terms of being able to mitigate the transmission of this virus.”"
coronavirus,"Since March of last year, 140 members or family members of the Culinary and Bartenders Union, which represents 60,000 workers in Las Vegas and Reno, have died from the virus and 1,392 have been hospitalized. The Culinary members work as guest room attendants, cocktail and food servers, porters, bellmen, cooks, bartenders, and laundry and kitchen workers. They’re just as concerned about the virus as everyone else is, said Argüello-Kline."
coronavirus,"The state’s largest workers union was not entirely happy with the new rule, however, telling HuffPost it doesn’t go far enough."
coronavirus,"“The protection has to be for all, not one side,” Geoconda Argüello-Kline, secretary-treasurer for the local Culinary Union, said in a phone interview Thursday. “The members feel like, OK, they wear their masks but what about everyone else? I think the right thing to do is to be fair with everyone. Employees wear their masks but everyone else too, who are inside.”"
coronavirus,"Under the county’s order, county workers will not have to wear a mask while in a private office or cubicle but will have to put one on when they come out and remain indoors. This new mask rule will remain in place until Aug. 17, which is when the board of commissioners plans to revisit these requirements."
coronavirus,"“This virus is looking for you,” Collins, who has led NIH since 2009, said on MSNBC’s “All In with Chris Hayes.”"
coronavirus,"Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, on Wednesday delivered a stark message for people who haven’t gotten the COVID-19 vaccine."
coronavirus,Coronavirus infections are again rising nationwide with the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant. But 99.5% of deaths from COVID-19 in the United States are now among the unvaccinated.
coronavirus,"People who are fully vaccinated will probably not be impacted by the spread of the delta variant and rising case numbers, said Collins."
coronavirus,"“Come on folks, if this is the reason that you are still deciding not to get immunized, this is a pretty flimsy one,” Collins said. “This is definitely the case that these vaccines have been proven in lots and lots of public data as being safe already. We really don’t need that full FDA approval to accept that.”"
coronavirus,"Collins didn’t buy the argument some cite against vaccination ― that the Food and Drug Administration has authorized vaccines for emergency use, but has not yet fully approved the shots. (Read here to see the difference between FDA emergency use authorization and full approval.)"
coronavirus,"“But if you’re unvaccinated, this virus is looking for you. And this is the moment it seems for everybody to hit their reset button, if they’ve been hesitant about getting immunized,” he added."
coronavirus,"“This is one of the most remarkable scientific achievements that humankind has put together ― vaccines that are this safe and this effective,” Collins said. “It’s astounding, and I got to say disheartening, that still we have some 85 million Americans who are resistant to taking advantage of this gift.” "
coronavirus,"Jackson, who previously served as Donald Trump’s presidential physician, apparently didn’t like reporters asking whether he was vaccinated against the coronavirus on Thursday morning. So he accused the questioners of political bias."
coronavirus,"Thoughts and prayers are in order for Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas), the former White House physician who has just contracted a terrible case of “whataboutism.”"
coronavirus,"The question came up because COVID-19 cases have tripled in the U.S. over the last few weeks with the spread of the delta variant. At the same time, a large percentage of the population remains stubbornly resistant to vaccination amid an onslaught of misinformation ― some of it spread by allies of the former president publicly supporting vaccine conspiracy theories."
coronavirus,"“I think you as a press have a responsibility to ask questions of the Democrats as well,” Jackson complained. “How many of the Democrats are willing to say whether or not they’ve been vaccinated?”"
coronavirus,"The first-year lawmaker, it turned out, made a rookie mistake by asking a rhetorical question without knowing the answer."
coronavirus,Jackson didn’t spout conspiracy theories. 
coronavirus,Some people pointed out Jackson’s dubious past.
coronavirus,"Instead, he asked why reporters were picking on him instead of other politicians."
coronavirus,Democratic politicians chimed in.
coronavirus,"As CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale noted, every Democrat in the House and Senate told the network back in May that they had been vaccinated, hence no need to raise the question again."
coronavirus,Others diagnosed Jackson’s “whataboutism.”
coronavirus,"
In March, the Department of Defense inspector general released a scathing report that concluded Jackson made “sexual and denigrating” comments about a female subordinate, violated the policy against drinking alcohol on a presidential trip and took prescription-strength sleeping medication that prompted worries from his colleagues about his ability to provide proper medical care.
"
coronavirus,Jackson’s time as White House doctor was marked by controversy.
coronavirus,He became a target of ridicule when at a news conference he praised Trump’s “incredibly good genes” and said he told the president “that if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years he might live to be 200 years old.” 
coronavirus,"Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-Texas) on Thursday tried to shame Democrats for not saying whether they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19 ― except every Democratic lawmaker is vaccinated and has confirmed as much, unlike a huge portion of Republicans who either aren’t vaccinated or won’t say."
coronavirus,"“I think you as a press have a responsibility to ask questions of the Democrats as well,” Jackson said. ”How many of the Democrats are willing to say whether or not they’ve been vaccinated?”"
coronavirus,"Jackson, a former White House physician, was trying to deflect a question from a reporter about whether it hurts Republicans’ efforts to urge the public to get vaccinated when so many of them won’t disclose their own status."
coronavirus,"In fact, as of mid-May, House and Senate Democratic lawmakers have had a 100% vaccination rate, according to a CNN survey of all lawmakers."
coronavirus,That same survey found that at least 44.8% of House Republicans and 92% of Senate Republicans are vaccinated. But 112 GOP offices did not respond to multiple CNN inquiries on their vaccination status.
coronavirus,"Jackson went on to raise questions about the vaccination status of the more than 50 Texas Democratic legislators who are in Washington, D.C., this month. They are hunkered down in the nation’s capital through early August to break a quorum in the Texas state House to stop a voter suppression bill. In recent days, six of them have tested positive for the coronavirus, despite being vaccinated."
coronavirus,"“Well, they’ve said that, including the six that tested positive. Do we have any evidence of that?” he asked. “I highly doubt that all six people were vaccinated and tested positive for this virus. So, you guys need to hold their feet to the fire.”"
coronavirus,"“What about the Texas delegation?” asked Jackson. When a reporter pointed out they are all vaccinated, he suggested some may be lying."
coronavirus,"HuffPost reached out to one of those Texas Democrats, state Rep. James Talarico of Round Rock, to confirm they are all vaccinated."
coronavirus,“Yep!” said Talarico. “So are all our staff members.”
coronavirus,"In March 2021, the Department of Defense inspector general released a scathing report about Jackson’s conduct in the White House, concluding that he made “sexual and denigrating” comments about a female subordinate, violated the policy on drinking alcohol on a presidential trip and took prescription-strength sleeping medication that prompted worries from his colleagues about his ability to provide proper medical care."
coronavirus,"None of the COVID-19 vaccines is 100% effective, and with the new and more contagious delta variant of the virus taking hold, there will be more instances of breakthrough cases, where people who are fully vaccinated are testing positive."
coronavirus,"The bottom line, though, as Jackson should know as a physician, is that the vaccine is working as intended: It is preventing people from getting seriously ill or dying from COVID-19, and when there is a breakthrough case, the symptoms are far less severe or not even detectable."
coronavirus,"Jackson served as physician to the president from 2013 to 2018 under Barack Obama and then Donald Trump. During his time with Trump, Jackson was ridiculed for praising the president’s “incredibly good genes” and telling Trump that “he might live to be 200 years old” if ate better."
coronavirus,"President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he expects the Food and Drug Administration to give its final approval to the slate of COVID-19 vaccines being used to fight the pandemic, a step he hopes will help combat lingering skepticism among Americans who have not been inoculated yet against the disease."
coronavirus,"The president made the comments at a CNN town hall event in Ohio, adding that he has not interfered with any of the science surrounding the coronavirus vaccines. Health experts have said full approval by the FDA could help ease, but not erase, vaccine hesitancy as the inoculations are currently being administered under the agency’s emergency use authorization provisions."
coronavirus,"“They’re not promising me any specific date, but my expectation, talking to the group of scientists we put together… plus others in the field, is that sometime, maybe in the beginning of the school year, at the end of August, beginning September, October, they’ll get a final approval,” Biden said."
coronavirus,Biden also said he was optimistic that children younger than 12 would be eligible to get vaccination shots “soon.”
coronavirus,"“Children 5, 6, 7, 8, they all have different makeups. They’re developing,” Biden said, noting that scientists were studying the vaccines’ effects in different age groups. “They’re trying to figure out whether or not there’s a vaccination that affects one child that is at such-and-such an age and not another child. That’s underway.”"
coronavirus,That hope comes just a few days after the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that all children older than 2 wear masks in school when they return to in-person learning this year. The group said the guidelines come amid a surge of COVID-19 cases linked to the highly transmissible delta variant of the virus and because many children are not yet vaccinated. 
coronavirus,"Vaccines remain the best defense against severe cases of COVID-19 and death associated with the disease, but in the U.S. they are authorized only for those 12 and older. "
coronavirus,"“We have a pandemic for those who haven’t gotten the vaccination,” he said. “It’s that basic, that simple.”"
coronavirus,"The president said the pandemic is severely affecting the portion of Americans who have not yet been inoculated. Almost all deaths linked to the pandemic are now among those who are unvaccinated, and concern is particularly high in states with low vaccination rates."
coronavirus,"The post, sent to her Instagram and Facebook accounts last week, was flagged by both social media platforms for spreading misinformation."
coronavirus,"She will be allowed to finish her planned stay at USA Wrestling’s pre-Olympic camp in Nakatsugawa, Japan.

coronavirus,TOKYO (AP) — The chiropractor for the American women’s wrestling team has apologized after comparing Olympic COVID-19 protocols to Nazi Germany in a social media post.
coronavirus,"“The USOPC does not condone or tolerate any behavior that intentionally offends or attacks others,” the USOPC said in a statement to the AP on Wednesday. “The post that this volunteer shared is completely inconsistent with our values and we made this clear to her as soon as we became aware of it."
coronavirus,"Biden also addressed the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories related to vaccinations on Wednesday, saying that amid the languishing levels of inoculations in the U.S., “the rest of the world is wondering about us.” "
coronavirus,"“What do you say to your grandchildren or your children about what’s happening? Do you ever remember a time like this before in the entire history, whether you’re a Democrat or a Republican?” the president said. “This is not who we are.”"
coronavirus,"Rosie Gallegos-Main, a chiropractor for women’s wrestling since 2009, said in a letter to the USA Wrestling Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee on Wednesday she was sorry “for my poor judgment and my choice to share this message.”"
coronavirus,"“As shown through her prompt removal of the share and her apology, she has shown clear remorse and committed to an educational process with DE&I experts. The USOPC will work with USA Wrestling to see that she gets that educational resource and understands our organization’s shared global purpose of building a better, more inclusive world through sport.”"
coronavirus,"“I now see that these are linked and can’t be separated,” she wrote. “I will never use this word again in any form that does not have a proper foundation for its usage, such as in a history lesson or in educating people about the past."
coronavirus,“I’m deeply saddened by this and wish to apologize for my poor judgment and my choice to share this message. I am also sorry that this may have been a distraction for the delegation which should be focused on supporting our athletes to the best of our ability.”
coronavirus,"The roughly 22,000 athletes, officials, coaches and media that have traveled to Japan for the Games are living under strict restrictions to prevent a surge in infections among the country’s general population. Japanese authorities said Monday that 21.6% of the nation’s 126 million population is fully vaccinated."
coronavirus,"Foreigners have been required to provide proof of negative virus tests within 72 hours of departure for Tokyo and are being tested throughout their stay. Travelers have spent hours waiting for paperwork approval at airports, and visitors have been mostly barred from interacting with the Japanese public during their first 14 days in the country."
coronavirus,"Gallegos-Main said she “did not put any thought into how the ending of the meme might affect others” and says she was placing “an emphasis on coercion by authorities, rather than anything to do with Germany and the Jewish people.”"
coronavirus,The 39-year-old made the dangerous escape from the hotel in the Perth suburb of Rivervale around 12.45 a.m. Tuesday. He remained at large for eight hours before police located him. He was charged with failure to comply with a direction and providing false or misleading information.

coronavirus,"Life expectancy in the U.S. fell by an astonishing year and a half in 2020, primarily due to the surge in deaths linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday."
coronavirus,"Other causes contributing to the fall in life expectancy in 2020 include injuries, homicide and diabetes, the report notes."
coronavirus,"The 1.5 year figure is an average for the entire country, but several demographic groups saw more significant drops. Hispanic Americans saw life expectancy fall by 3 years and Black Americans saw life expectancy fall by 2.9 years. Among white Americans the drop was 1.2 years."

coronavirus,"“The mark of success is making sure that any cases are identified, isolated, traced and cared for as quickly as possible and onward transmission is interrupted,” he said."
coronavirus,"“Life expectancy has been increasing gradually every year for the past several decades,” Arias told Reuters. “The decline between 2019 and 2020 was so large that it took us back to the levels we were in 2003. Sort of like we lost a decade.”"
coronavirus,"The agency released the figures as part of a provisional report on the shift in mortality it publishes each year. While the numbers must be finalized by the CDC, the decline would be the largest in a single year since World War II and reflects the long toll the pandemic will have on the nation even after the country opens up once more."
coronavirus,"And the pandemic is not over. Cases are surging in every state in the country mainly due to the delta variant of the virus, a highly transmissible strain that now accounts for 83% of new cases in the U.S. Almost every death in the nation, however, is among those who are unvaccinated."

coronavirus,"MISSION, Kan. (AP) — COVID-19 cases tripled in the U.S. over two weeks amid an onslaught of vaccine misinformation that is straining hospitals, exhausting doctors and pushing clergy into the fray.“Our staff, they are frustrated,"" said Chad Neilsen, director of infection prevention at UF Health Jacksonville, a Florida hospital that is canceling elective surgeries and procedures after the number of mostly unvaccinated COVID-19 inpatients at its two campuses jumped to 134, up from a low of 16 in mid-May.“They are tired. They are thinking this is déjà vu all over again, and there is some anger because we know that this is a largely preventable situation, and people are not taking advantage of the vaccine.”Across the U.S., the seven-day rolling average for daily new cases rose over the past two weeks to more than 37,000 on Tuesday, up from less than 13,700 on July 6, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Health officials blame the delta variant and slowing vaccination rates. Just 56.2% of Americans have gotten at least one dose of the vaccine, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.In Louisiana, health officials reported 5,388 new COVID-19 cases Wednesday — the third-highest daily count since the beginning of the pandemic in early 2020. Hospitalizations for the disease rose to 844 statewide, up more than 600 since mid-June.“It is like seeing the car wreck before it happens,” said Dr. James Williams, a clinical associate professor of emergency medicine at Texas Tech, who has recently started treating more COVID-19 patients. “None of us want to go through this again.”He said the patients are younger — many in their 20s, 30s and 40s — and overwhelmingly unvaccinated.“People were just begging for this,"" he said of the vaccine. “And remarkably it was put together within a year, which is just astonishing. People don’t even appreciate that. Within a year, we got a vaccine. And now they are thinking, ‘Hmm, I don’t know if I will get it.'""As lead pastor of one of Missouri’s largest churches, Jeremy Johnson has heard the reasons congregants don’t want the COVID-19 vaccine. He wants them to know it’s not only OK to get vaccinated, it’s what the Bible urges.“I think there is a big influence of fear,” said Johnson, whose Springfield-based church also has a campus in Nixa and another about to open in Republic. “A fear of trusting something apart from scripture, a fear of trusting something apart from a political party they’re more comfortable following. A fear of trusting in science. We hear that: ‘I trust in God, not science.’ But the truth is science and God are not something you have to choose between.”Now many churches in southwestern Missouri, like Johnson’s Assembly of God-affiliated North Point Church, are hosting vaccination clinics. Meanwhile, about 200 church leaders have signed onto a statement urging Christians to get vaccinated, and on Wednesday announced a follow-up public service campaign.Opposition to vaccination is especially strong among white evangelical Protestants, who make up more than one-third of Missouri’s residents, according to a 2019 report by the Pew Research Center.“We found that the faith community is very influential, very trusted, and to me that is one of the answers as to how you get your vaccination rates up,” said Ken McClure, mayor of Springfield.The two hospitals in his city are teeming with patients, reaching record and near-record pandemic highs. Steve Edwards, who is the CEO of CoxHealth in Springfield, tweeted that the hospital has brought in 175 traveling nurses and has 46 more scheduled to arrive by Monday.“Grateful for the help,"" wrote Edwards, who previously tweeted that anyone spreading misinformation about the vaccine should “shut up.""In New York City, workers in city-run hospitals and health clinics will be required to get vaccinated or get tested weekly as officials battle a rise in COVID-19 cases, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday.De Blasio’s order will not apply to teachers, police officers and other city employees, but it's part of the city’s intense focus on vaccinations amid an increase in delta variant infections.The number of vaccine doses being given out daily in the city has dropped to less than 18,000, down from a peak of more than 100,000 in early April. About 65% of all adults are fully vaccinated, but the inoculation rate is around 25% among Black adults under age 45. About 45% of the workforce in the city’s public hospital system is Black.Meanwhile, caseloads have been rising in the city for weeks, and health officials say the variant makes up about 7 in 10 cases they sequence.“We need our health care workers to be vaccinated, and it’s getting dangerous with the delta variant,” de Blasio told CNN.Back in Louisiana, New Orleans officials weighed a possible revival of at least some of the mitigation efforts that had been eased as the disease was waning.Mayor LaToya Cantrell and the city’s top health official, Dr. Jennifer Avegno, were expected to make an announcement later Wednesday. On Tuesday, Cantrell spokesman Beau Tidwell said “all options are on the table.”___Salter reported from St. Louis."

coronavirus,"The reporter later identified herself online as Tia Mitchell, Washington correspondent for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution."
coronavirus,"“Tia, you crack me up,” she said. “You know what, I think people’s responsibility is their own. To read the information ― and it’s everywhere. You can’t go by any street corner practically and not see something about COVID-19. I believe in people’s own individual responsibility to read, to find out and to make their own decision.”"

coronavirus,"“When you talk to people who run hospitals, in New Orleans or other states, 90% of people in [the] hospital with [the] delta variant have not been vaccinated,” he continued. “That’s another signal the vaccine works.”"
coronavirus,Scalise also said he waited partly because he had tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies and believed he had existing immunity from what was likely a mild case of the virus. 
coronavirus,"While public health officials have said that antibodies from contracting the virus may provide some protection, they are not a replacement for the COVID-19 vaccine."
coronavirus,"New COVID-19 cases have been rising substantially since May thanks to the extremely contagious delta variant. Cases have surged this month, with an average of 35,547 new cases as of Monday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The vast majority of new cases are among the unvaccinated, prompting some areas of the country to reinstate public health measures to protect against the virus’ spread."
coronavirus,"The Louisiana Department of Health reported on Monday that area hospitals have the most COVID-19 patients since February, when the deadly winter surge was starting to lessen. The state is seeing an average of 1,425 new cases per day, a stark increase from the average 903 cases per day just a week before. "

Nearly two-thirds of counties still have vaccination rates of less than 40%. Where vaccination rates are low, cases and hospitalizations are starting to climb again, allowing for the delta variant’s spread, she said."

coronavirus,"NEW DELHI (AP) — India’s excess deaths during the pandemic could be a staggering 10 times the official COVID-19 toll, likely making it modern India’s worst human tragedy, according to the most comprehensive research yet on the ravages of the virus in the south Asian country."
coronavirus,"Most experts believe India’s official toll of more than 414,000 dead is a vast undercount, but the government has dismissed those concerns as exaggerated and misleading."
coronavirus,The report released Tuesday estimated excess deaths — the gap between those recorded and those that would have been expected — to be between 3 million to 4.7 million between January 2020 and June 2021. It said an accurate figure may “prove elusive” but the true death toll “is likely to be an order of magnitude greater than the official count.”
coronavirus,"The report, published by Arvind Subramanian, the Indian government’s former chief economic adviser, and two other researchers at the Center for Global Development and Harvard University, said the count could have missed deaths occurring in overwhelmed hospitals or while health care was delayed or disrupted, especially during the devastating peak surge earlier this year."
coronavirus,"“True deaths are likely to be in the several millions not hundreds of thousands, making this arguably India’s worst human tragedy since Partition and independence,” the report said."
coronavirus,The Partition of the British-ruled Indian subcontinent into independent India and Pakistan in 1947 led to the killing of up to 1 million people as gangs of Hindus and Muslims slaughtered each other.
coronavirus,"The report on India’s virus toll used three calculation methods: data from the civil registration system that records births and deaths across seven states, blood tests showing the prevalence of the virus in India alongside global COVID-19 fatality rates, and an economic survey of nearly 900,000 people done thrice a year."
coronavirus,"Researchers cautioned that each method had weaknesses, such as the economic survey omitting the causes of death."
coronavirus,"And while other nations are believed to have undercounted deaths in the pandemic, India is believed to have a greater gap due to it having the world’s second highest population of 1.4 billion and its situation is complicated because not all deaths were recorded even before the pandemic."
coronavirus,"Researchers also cautioned that virus prevalence and COVID-19 deaths in the seven states they studied may not translate to all of India, since the virus could have spread worse in urban versus rural states and since health care quality varies greatly around India."
coronavirus,"Instead, researchers looked at deaths from all causes and compared that data to mortality in previous years — a method widely considered an accurate metric."
coronavirus,"“This analysis reiterates the observations of other fearless investigative journalists that have highlighted the massive undercounting of deaths,” Jacob said."
coronavirus,"Dr. Jacob John, who studies viruses at the Christian Medical College at Vellore in southern India, reviewed the report for The Associated Press and said it underscores the devastating impact COVID-19 had on the country’s under-prepared health system."
coronavirus,The report also estimated that nearly 2 million Indians died during the first surge in infections last year and said not “grasping the scale of the tragedy in real time” may have “bred collective complacency that led to the horrors” of the surge earlier this year.
coronavirus,"Over the last few months, some Indian states have increased their COVID-19 death toll after finding thousands of previously unreported cases, raising concerns that many more fatalities were not officially recorded."
coronavirus,Several Indian journalists have also published higher numbers from some states using government data. Scientists say this new information is helping them better understand how COVID-19 spread in India.
coronavirus,"Murad Banaji, who studies mathematics at Middlesex University and has been looking at India’s COVID-19 mortality figures, said the recent data has confirmed some of the suspicions about undercounting. Banaji said the new data also shows the virus wasn’t restricted to urban centers, as contemporary reports had indicated, but that India’s villages were also badly impacted."

coronavirus,"While some people praised Twitter’s action, critics asked why Greene (who has previously praised people refusing to receive the vaccine, railed against the wearing of masks and likened House mask mandates to the Holocaust) wasn’t booted from the platform forever."

coronavirus,"“The equities overwhelmingly favor allowing the cruise industry to enjoy its first summer season in two years while this Court sorts out the CDC’s contentions on appeal,” Florida’s lawyers argued."
coronavirus,"The CDC first flatly halted cruise ships from sailing in March 2020 in response to the coronavirus pandemic, which had affected passengers and crew on numerous ships."
coronavirus,"The CDC, however, said keeping the rules in place would prevent future COVID-19 outbreaks on ships that are vulnerable to the spread of the virus because of their close quarters and frequent stops at foreign ports."
coronavirus,Then the CDC on Oct. 30 of last year imposed a four-phase conditional framework it said would allow the industry to gradually resume operations if certain thresholds were met. Those included virus mitigation procedures and a simulated cruise to test them before embarking regular passengers.
coronavirus,"“The undisputed evidence shows that unregulated cruise ship operations would exacerbate the spread of COVID-19, and that the harm to the public that would result from such operations cannot be undone,” the CDC said in a court filing."
coronavirus,"Merryday’s decision concluded that the CDC can’t enforce those rules for Florida-based ships and that they should merely be considered nonbinding recommendations or guidelines. Several cruise lines have begun preliminary cruises under those guidelines, which the Tampa judge agreed with Florida are too onerous."
coronavirus,"The 11th Circuit’s brief decision did not include any opinions from the judges, which the panel said would be released later. The decision noted that one appeals judge dissented."
coronavirus,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Two more Texas lawmakers who left their state to hobble efforts to pass new voting restrictions have tested positive for the coronavirus, raising to five the number of infected people in the delegation."
coronavirus,"Disney Cruise Lines held its first simulated sailing under CDC rules Saturday when the Disney Dream departed from Port Canaveral, Florida. The passengers were volunteer Disney employees."
coronavirus,A person familiar with the delegation said the number of infected members had risen to five. The person was not authorized to discuss the matter and requested anonymity.
coronavirus,"Vice President Kamala Harris, who had met last week with members of the Texas delegation, went to the Walter Reed military hospital on Sunday for a routine doctor’s appointment, a White House official said. No other information was released, and the White House did not respond to questions about Harris’ visit."
coronavirus,"After a photo showed them maskless on the plane, Republicans and others criticized the lawmakers for traveling without masks. But federal pandemic guidelines don’t require masks to be worn on private aircraft."
coronavirus,"After some of the lawmakers tested positive for the virus, Harris’ spokesperson said Saturday that Harris and her staff were not at risk of exposure because they were not in close contact with those who tested positive and added that Harris and her staff were fully vaccinated."
coronavirus,"“Florida persuasively claims that the conditional sailing order will shut down most cruises through the summer and perhaps much longer,” the judge wrote in June, adding that Florida “faces an increasingly threatening and imminent prospect that the cruise industry will depart the state.”"
coronavirus,"State Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer of San Antonio said in a statement Sunday that he had tested positive. “I am quarantining until I test negative, and I am grateful to be only experiencing extremely mild symptoms,” he said."
coronavirus,More than 50 Texas lawmakers traveled to Washington on Monday aboard a private charter flight. A caucus official has said all had been vaccinated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says “breakthrough” infections — vaccinated people becoming infected — are rare.
coronavirus,"Vaccines for children in the U.S. are currently authorized only for those 12 and older, meaning many students will likely return to classrooms without inoculations this fall. The AAP pointed to those restrictions in its recommendations as well as the inability of many schools to monitor students’ vaccination status, particularly in communities with low vaccination rates."
coronavirus,"The policy guidelines reflect ongoing concerns about the spread of COVID-19, particularly after the highly transmissible delta variant of the virus became the dominant strain in the United States. Case numbers a rising in every state, and some regions have decided to reinstate mask mandates — including Los Angeles County — amid ongoing calls from public health officials urging citizens to get vaccinated."
coronavirus,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had said in May that fully vaccinated people could remove their masks in most settings amid a vaccination blitz, but the delta variant has upended some regions’ plans."
coronavirus,"“We need to prioritize getting children back into schools alongside their friends and their teachers ― and we all play a role in making sure it happens safely,” Sonja O’Leary, chair of the AAP Council on School Health, said in a statement. “Combining layers of protection that include vaccinations, masking and clean hands hygiene will make in-person learning safe and possible for everyone.”"
coronavirus,"The guidelines, which strongly support the return to in-person learning in the coming months, reflect a multi-pronged approach to see students return safely to the classroom more than a year and a half after the pandemic began."
coronavirus,The Democrats fled the state to deny the Republican-controlled Legislature the necessary quorum to pass the voting laws.
coronavirus,"The American Academy of Pediatrics recommended Monday that all children over the age of 2 should wear masks in school this fall, regardless of vaccination status, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues across the nation."
coronavirus,"Vaccines are the best defense against severe cases of COVID-19 and death associated with the disease, and the current inoculations protect well against the delta strain. Almost all of the nation’s current coronavirus deaths are among people who were not vaccinated, prompting concern from health officials about a stubborn stall in the level of inoculations. Less than half of the county is fully vaccinated."
coronavirus,"The body also recommended that parents ensure their children are caught up on vaccinations they may have missed during the pandemic and that schools provide adequate ventilation indoors, as well as increased resources for testing, quarantining and cleaning when positive cases of the virus emerge. (The AAP’s guidelines include exclusions for students with medical conditions or disabilities.)"
coronavirus,"Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, said Monday on CNN that the AAP’s recommendations were sensible considering a large swath of the country remained unvaccinated, particularly during the spread of the delta variant."
coronavirus,"Murthy’s warning came just days after Los Angeles County said all residents would be required to wear masks indoors again, regardless of vaccination status, as new infections linked to the delta variant increased in the region. The delta variant is highly transmissible and already accounts for a majority of the new cases in the U.S. Public health officials have warned that unvaccinated Americans are particularly vulnerable."
coronavirus,"“It’s very reasonable for counties to take more mitigation measures like the mask rules you see coming out in LA, and I anticipate that will happen in other parts of the country too,” Murthy said during an interview on ABC News’ “This Week.”"
coronavirus,"Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said this week that he expected more areas to reinstate COVID-19 prevention measures, including mask requirements, on a rolling basis as more transmissible variants cause case spikes."
coronavirus,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and California state health policy require people who are unvaccinated to wear masks in public. In May, the CDC announced that fully vaccinated people could remove their masks in most settings. Murthy added that the CDC’s guidance had always included flexibility for local jurisdictions to impose tighter restrictions if needed."
coronavirus,"Last Thursday, Murthy released his first advisory since he was appointed surgeon general by President Joe Biden, issuing a warning to the nation that the spread of COVID-19 misinformation was an “insidious threat” to the U.S. He called out tech companies for failing to rein in anti-vaccination posts, saying modern social media giants have “enabled misinformation to poison our information environment with little accountability to their users.”"
coronavirus,"“When you have a degree of viral dynamics in the community and you have a substantial proportion of the population that is unvaccinated, you really want to go the extra step, the extra mile to make sure that there’s not a lot of transmission, even breakthrough infections among vaccinated individuals,” he said. “I think that the American Academy of Pediatrics, you know, they’re a thoughtful group, they analyze the situation and if they feel that that’s the way to go, I think that’s a reasonable thing to do."
coronavirus,"The delta strain has upended plans for a full reopening of society in Los Angeles and other parts of the country. Although new cases and hospitalizations dropped significantly in the spring, the U.S. is currently in the midst of a significant surge in the pandemic. According to The New York Times, new coronavirus cases have soared 140% in the past two weeks. And less than half of the country is fully vaccinated."
coronavirus,"“They’ve designed product features, such as ‘Like’ buttons, that reward us for sharing emotionally charged content, not accurate content,” Murthy said at the White House last week. “And their algorithms tend to give us more of what we click on, pulling us deeper and deeper into a well of misinformation.”"
coronavirus,"Despite the high transmissibility of the delta variant, the current vaccine offerings remain effective at preventing severe illness and death associated with COVID-19. Almost all of the nation’s current coronavirus deaths are among people who were not vaccinated, a statistic Murthy said he was particularly troubled by."
coronavirus,"Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said Sunday that he anticipates more counties around the nation will reinstitute COVID-19 prevention measures, including mask mandates, amid case surges linked to more transmissible variants of the coronavirus."
coronavirus,"The feat was possible on a small island, he recalled, but it would have been quicker and easier to target communities with educational outreach in the languages they speak with more specific state data, which provides information about Native Hawaiians but lumps together other all other Pacific Islanders."
coronavirus,"Before the detailed data was readily and widely available, Dr. Kapono Chong-Hanssen on Kauai printed lists of people who checked the Pacific Islander box and looked at last names in an attempt to figure out specific racial backgrounds."
coronavirus,"Now a member of the Honolulu City Council, Kiaʻāina introduced a resolution adopted last month urging Hawaii government agencies to go beyond minimum federal standards and get more specific when collecting racial data in one of the most racially diverse states in the nation."
coronavirus,"Of Hawaii’s 1.5 million residents, 38% are Asian — mostly Japanese and Filipino — 26% are white, 2% are Black, and many people are multiple ethnicities, according to U.S. census figures. Native Hawaiians account for about 20% of the population."
coronavirus,"HONOLULU (AP) — A few months into the pandemic, data showed Pacific Islanders suffered the highest infection rates in Hawaii."
coronavirus,"But what early numbers didn’t publicly show was which Pacific Islanders in the diverse identification category — which includes people with ethnic roots in Samoa, Micronesia and other islands but excludes Native Hawaiians — were affected the most."
coronavirus,"The health equity report, published in March of this year, showed that the two single largest groups represented among Pacific Islander COVID-19 cases were Samoan at 29% and Chuukese at 24%."
coronavirus,"In the 1990s, prompted by concerns that Native Hawaiian students were considered overrepresented in colleges when counted as Asian, Esther Kiaʻāina worked at the federal level to separate Native Hawaiian data from Asian data. Since then, however, all other Pacific Islanders have remained in one category."
coronavirus,"In August 2020, when Hawaii recorded its greatest number of cases, people who identify as Pacific Islander represented 24% of all COVID-19 cases but accounted for just 4% of the state’s population, according to a report by the state Department of Health with academic and community groups."
coronavirus,"“We’re geographically unique and we are culturally, racially, ethnically very unique in comparison to the rest of the United States,” said Chong-Hanssen, medical director of the Kauai Community Health Center and a board member of the Association of Native Hawaiian Physicians. “So the federal standards don’t really serve our public health ... and other services.”"
coronavirus,"Disaggregated data — data that is broken down into smaller groupings — is also helpful now in the effort to urge people to get vaccinated, he said."
coronavirus,"“We’re doing this not only to get the data to determine funding priorities, it’s also to promulgate policies to address the underlying disparities for whatever reason,” she said, “whether it be housing, whether it be education, whether it be health.”"
coronavirus,"The resolution provides separate categories for Samoan, Micronesian, Tongan, Chamorro and “other Pacific Islander.” Categories also include white, Black, American Indian or Alaska Native, Filipino, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese and “other Asian.”"
coronavirus,"Even though the resolution isn’t binding, Kiaʻāina said that the agencies she contacted so far are supportive. She said she plans to send the resolution to city and state agencies, asking them to comply voluntarily."
coronavirus,"On the Big Island, Dr. Wilfred Alik, who is from the Republic of the Marshall Islands and speaks Marshallese, said he made it a point to collect specific ethnicity data on his own when talking with a Pacific Islander patient who tested positive."
coronavirus,"Early in the pandemic, We Are Oceania, a group that advocates for Hawaii’s Micronesian communities, asked state health officials to provide specific data for Pacific Islanders, said the group’s CEO, Josie Howard."
coronavirus,"While they believed that data would be key to understanding how people were affected by the virus, they also worried that the data would further stigmatize Micronesian people, who are often the targets of racism in Hawaii, Howard said."
coronavirus,"While groups organized collectively as Asian and Pacific Islander can bring strength in numbers to smaller communities, getting specific data is helpful for contact tracing especially with language skills and cultural sensitivity, said Alik, who works for Kaiser Permanente."
coronavirus,"Stigmatization and privacy were also concerns for state health officials, who already collect detailed, disaggregated data beyond what’s recommended by the City Council resolution, said Joshua Quint, an epidemiologist with the Department of Health. There are limits on how to responsibly release data, including privacy issues, especially when it comes to small populations, he said."
coronavirus,"In Hawaii, there are an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 Micronesians, who began migrating here in bigger numbers in the 1990s in search of economic and educational opportunities, according to We are Oceania. Numbers for people who are from Chuuk, one of the four states in the Federated States of Micronesia, are harder to pinpoint."
coronavirus,"It’s also difficult to detect disparities when there aren’t good population estimates for smaller groups, such as Chuukese people, Quint said."
coronavirus,"That’s among the reasons they don’t break Pacific Islanders down in what’s available on the department’s COVID-19 website, he said."
coronavirus,"Without specific data, it becomes harder to advocate for Samoan language education services in Hawaii public schools, she said as an example."
coronavirus,"“When we are lumped together ... when it comes to services, we’re like in the back burner,” said Elisapeta Alaimaleata, executive director of the Le Fetuao Samoan Language Center."
coronavirus,Advocates say expanding the options in the ethnicity category is an issue that goes beyond the pandemic.
coronavirus,"When virus cases were first diagnosed in Hawaii, health officials asked questions of those who tested positive that focused on their travel histories, Quint said. But when community spread of the virus was established, social disparities among racial and ethnic groups began to emerge."
coronavirus,"Apparently, Meghan McCain doesn’t watch Fox News that much. The co-host of “The View” claimed Monday that she has never seen the network discourage people from getting a COVID-19 vaccine ― something its hosts and guests do regularly."
coronavirus,"The ability to mark a box that’s not simply “other,” can have benefits for personal identity, said Chong-Hanssen, who is half white, a quarter Chinese and a quarter Native Hawaiian, and grew up in Iowa."
coronavirus,"“It helps the larger population, at least in Hawaii, if not in the larger United States, understand that we exist,” he said. “These different types of Pacific Islanders are real people.”"
coronavirus,"McCain offered the dubious viewpoint when a panel on her show was discussing a “Fox & Friends” segment in which Steve Doocy pointed out that COVID-19 is mostly killing unvaccinated people and Brian Kilmeade countered by saying, “That’s their choice.”"
coronavirus,"“Not everybody on Fox News is, you know, saying don’t get the vaccine,” McCain said. “I actually haven’t heard anyone say that, but maybe I’m just misinformed.”"
coronavirus,Sunny Hostin brought up a new Media Matters study suggesting 60% of Fox News segments on the vaccine undermined immunization efforts. 
coronavirus,Others brought up some helpful context regarding McCain and her relationship to Fox News.
coronavirus,Twitter users quickly sprang into action.
coronavirus,"During a segment on the COVID-19 vaccine, co-host Steve Doocy encouraged viewers to get their shots, saying that “99% of the people who died have not been vaccinated.”"
coronavirus,"Kilmeade, however, felt compelled to stick up for the vaccine-hesitant — whose failure to take action has made it easier for coronavirus variants to spread."
coronavirus,“Fox & Friends” co-host Brian Kilmeade might as well be known as “Brian KILL-MEade” after the shocking comments he made on Monday’s show.
coronavirus,"“That’s their choice,” he cut in."
coronavirus,"“They don’t wanna die,” Doocy responded, “so the administration and the government is saying we need the mask mandate to protect the unvaccinated.”"
coronavirus,Kilmeade then claimed the government isn’t responsible for protecting its citizens from death.
coronavirus,"Many Twitter users clapped backed at Kilmeade, saying that protecting citizens is, in fact, the government’s duty."
coronavirus,"“That’s not their job, it’s not their job to protect anybody!” he insisted."
coronavirus,Others noted that Kilmeade had opened a can of worms in his never-ending effort to own those dang libs.
coronavirus,"Former Fox News reporter Carl Cameron on Monday called out Tucker Carlson’s doubtful diatribes against COVID-19 vaccines, saying his ex-colleague at the conservative network was “gaslighting” viewers for ratings and revenue."
coronavirus,Some people still can’t believe Kilmeade said what he said.
coronavirus,One person suggested a possible new marketing campaign for Kilmeade’s network.
coronavirus,"Cameron, Fox’s chief political correspondent until 2017, noted how new COVID-19 cases in the United States have soared in just the last week — with 99.5% of deaths among those who have not been vaccinated. "
coronavirus,"“It’s about ratings and ratings ultimately become revenue, and that’s the name of the game,” Cameron told CNN’s “New Day” about personalities on Fox and other hyperpartisan media outlets that have questioned the shots. Vaccine resistance has now become a GOP rallying cry, even though the shots have been shown safe and effective."
coronavirus,"“It makes no sense whatsoever,” he said. “This is literally the metaphor of the lemmings running to their own slaughter. People who are listening to that sort of stuff instead of the science that goes way way back.”"
coronavirus,"People who dispute that scientific evidence are putting lives at risk, said Cameron."
coronavirus,"“Whoever gets the most clicks on social media, makes the most money, gets the most fame, gets the most attention and that type of activity is not journalism,” Cameron continued. “It’s not news. It’s gaslighting. It’s propaganda.”"
coronavirus,"“It is the opinion hosts who aren’t journalists per se, they’re talking heads, and their job, their reward is bringing eyeballs on television, and all they really gotta do is keep people watching until it’s commercial time, and then it’s ka-ching ka-ching ka-ching for the networks,” he said. “And it works really well in prime time, but it’s not news.”"
coronavirus,Then there were those who just brought receipts.
coronavirus,"So Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson has hit the road, meeting face-to-face with residents to try to overcome vaccine hesitancy — in many cases, hostility — in Arkansas, which has the highest rate of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. but is near the very bottom in dispensing shots."
coronavirus,"He is meeting with residents like Harvey Woods, who was among five dozen people who gathered at a convention center ballroom in Texarkana on Thursday night. Most of the audience wasn’t masked, and neither was Hutchinson, who has been vaccinated."
coronavirus,"TEXARKANA, Ark. (AP) — Free lottery tickets for those who get vaccinated had few takers. Free hunting and fishing licenses didn’t change many minds either. And this being red-state Arkansas, mandatory vaccinations are off the table."
coronavirus,Hutchinson and his top health official tried to reassure Woods about the Food and Drug Administration’s review process. But Hutchinson had a question for Woods.
coronavirus,"Woods, 67, introduced himself to Hutchinson as “anti-vax” and said that he thinks there are too many questions about the effects of the vaccine and that he doesn’t believe the information from the federal government about them is reliable."
coronavirus,"Hutchinson embarked on the statewide tour as he took over as chairman of the National Governors Association. In that role, he has called combating vaccine resistance a priority."
coronavirus,"“Let me make sure it’s clear: I’m not asking you to trust government,” he told the Texarkana audience. “I’m asking you to look at, do your own research, talk to people that you trust, and that to me is the right approach.”"
coronavirus,"Studies have shown the vaccines to be highly safe and effective. But misinformation continues to sow doubts about them, especially in conservative and rural areas. Hutchinson has urged the FDA to give full approval to the vaccines instead of emergency authorization, saying that would address one of the arguments used by opponents."
coronavirus,The approach is different from that of other Republicans who are portraying health leaders as adversaries even as they try to tamp down cases.
coronavirus,Hutchinson has few tools left at his disposal after signing into law measures curbing his own authority to respond to the pandemic. They include bans on public schools and other government agencies mandating masks or requiring vaccinations.
coronavirus,"At the forums, Hutchinson tries to empathize with the vaccine skeptics’ anti-government, anti-media sentiment. His message: Listen to your own doctors and medical professionals, not conspiracy theories."
coronavirus,"With the highly contagious delta variant rapidly driving up case counts around the country and filling hospital beds in places like Arkansas and neighboring Missouri, just 35% of Arkansas’ population is fully vaccinated. Only Mississippi and Alabama are lower, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And 98% of the people hospitalized in Arkansas since January because of COVID-19 were unvaccinated."
coronavirus,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has been selling shirts and other merchandise emblazoned “Don’t Fauci My Florida.” In Missouri, Gov. Mike Parson has suggested some health officials are trying to scare people into getting vaccinated. In Tennessee, the top vaccine official was fired amid GOP anger over her efforts to get teenagers vaccinated."
coronavirus,"Some holdouts at the forums aren’t ruling the vaccine out. In Texarkana, one woman said she hadn’t gotten the shots over concerns about how they would interact with her allergies. Doctors in the audience encouraged her to talk with her physician."
coronavirus,"“I’m not afraid of it,” said Woods, who later said he contracted the virus last year."
coronavirus,"A mostly unmasked audience of about 100 people gathered at one of his town halls in Batesville, a town of 11,000 approximately 90 minutes outside Little Rock."
coronavirus,The forums are also drawing vaccinated residents who are concerned about the state’s rising cases and exasperated at its lack of options to stem the surge.
coronavirus,"Kameron Bethel, a Batesville mother of six, asked if there was a way she could obtain a waiver to get her 10-year old son vaccinated. She also asked the governor to reinstate the mask mandate he lifted in March."
coronavirus,"“They haven’t shot straight with us. The CDC hasn’t shot straight with us. Fauci hasn’t shot straight with us. They’ve changed their stories multiple times,” said Grant, next to whom sat a fellow vaccine skeptic in a baseball cap that read “Trump: No More Bulls—t.”"
coronavirus,"Nathan Grant, a 66-year-old retired accountant from Batesville, said he didn’t know of anything Hutchinson could tell him that would change his mind. Grant has resisted getting the vaccine despite contracting COVID-19 last year. He said he didn’t trust any of the advice coming from Washington."
coronavirus,"The forum was enough to sway Teresa Cox and her daughter, who got vaccinated at a mobile clinic after the Texarkana town hall. Cox said she doesn’t trust Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top COVID-19 expert, but had confidence in the doctors who spoke at the event."
coronavirus,"“Yes, we are a great community, but I think if we don’t work together and get it together, it’s all going to fall apart,” she said."
coronavirus,"“What they said in there scared me,” Cox said. “I have been anti-vaccine all along, but I have also been on a ventilator three times, and I don’t want to be back on a ventilator. You don’t forget it.” "
coronavirus,“Do you believe COVID is real?” the governor asked.
coronavirus,The new local mandate is not a contradiction of CDC policy.
coronavirus,"The CDC does not currently recommend that vaccinated individuals wear masks indoors — except where required by law. As cases of the dangerous and highly contagious delta variant of COVID-19 soar, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said at a White House press briefing Friday that localities experiencing increases in cases may consider reinstating indoor mask mandates to protect against the disease. The World Health Organization still urges fully vaccinated people to wear masks."
coronavirus,"The Los Angeles County sheriff has announced his department won’t enforce the county Department of Public Health’s reinstated indoor mask mandate as COVID-19 cases soar in the area, falsely claiming it’s “not backed by science.”"
coronavirus,"“Forcing the vaccinated and those who already contracted COVID-19 to wear masks indoors is not backed by science and contradicts the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines,” he added."
coronavirus,"Villanueva acknowledged the county health department’s legal right to enforce its order. However, he urged the agency to “work collaboratively with ... law enforcement to establish mandates that are both achievable and supported by science.” He also called for “voluntary” compliance with the order."
coronavirus,Sheriff Alex Villanueva said in a statement Friday that he “will not expend our limited resources” to enforce the new order.
coronavirus,"The county recorded 1,902 new COVID-19 cases and six deaths on Friday alone. On Saturday it reported 1,827 new cases and 11 deaths. The numbers were the highest daily total the region has seen in months, the Los Angeles Times reported."
coronavirus,"New coronavirus cases among vaccinated residents are low, but are still a concern, noted county officials. There have have been a total of 4,122 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Tuesday of those fully vaccinated."
coronavirus,"California relaxed health restrictions last month, but after the number of new COVID-19 cases climbed in the Los Angeles area, public health officials announced Thursday that all county residents, regardless of vaccination status, are now required to wear a mask while indoors (as of Saturday)."
coronavirus,"Walensky warned Friday that the new upsurge in cases is a “pandemic of the unvaccinated,” roaring through areas with low vaccination rates. Only 52% of the more than 10 million residents of Los Angeles County — the most populous county in the nation — have been fully vaccinated. Nearly 4 million people there have not been vaccinated, including 1.3 million children under the age of 12. "
coronavirus,"“The alarming increases in cases, positivity rates and the increase in hospitalizations signals immediate action must be taken to slow the spread of COVID-19,” county Health Officer Dr. Muntu Davis said in a statement. “Otherwise, we may quickly see more devastating illness and death among the millions of residents.”"
coronavirus,"The U.S. recorded a total of 79,310 new cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, the highest daily tally in the world, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. "
coronavirus,The new ordinance will go into effect late Saturday night and comes just a month after California dropped most restrictions for vaccinated people and restarted its economy. 
coronavirus,"“We’re not where we need to be for the millions at risk of infection here in Los Angeles County, and waiting to do something will be too late given what we’re seeing now,” Dr. Muntu Davis, the county’s health officer, said during a news briefing. “This is an all-hands-on-deck moment.”"
coronavirus,"Los Angeles County said Thursday that residents will be required to wear masks indoors once more, regardless of vaccination status, amid the spread of the highly contagious delta variant of COVID-19."
coronavirus,"Previously, those who were fully vaccinated were allowed to remove their masks across California, but health officials said the new measures would help stanch the spread of the delta strain. The orders will be in place for the foreseeable future, although Davis stressed that more restrictions could be put in place should case numbers begin to skyrocket."
coronavirus,"“Wearing a mask indoors with others reduces the risk of both getting & transmitting the virus,” Los Angeles Public Health wrote on Twitter. “We’re requiring masking for everyone while indoors at public settings & businesses, regardless of vaccination status so that we can stop the increased level of transmission we’re seeing.”"
coronavirus,"In late June, public health officials in Los Angeles urged residents to wear masks once more in public spaces, citing the spread of the delta strain, which has since become the dominant variant of COVID-19 in the United States."
coronavirus,"Los Angeles County is averaging more than 1,000 new cases a day, a sharp increase from the average of 173 cases per day when the state was still under virus restrictions in mid-June. The Los Angeles Times notes, however, that cases and hospitalizations are more than 93% lower than they were at the height of the pandemic, and deaths are at low levels. "
coronavirus,TORONTO (AP) — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday Canada could start allowing fully vaccinated Americans into Canada as of mid-August for non-essential travel and should be in a position to welcome fully vaccinated travelers from all countries by early September.
coronavirus,About 51% of California’s population has been fully vaccinated.
coronavirus,Trudeau noted Canada continues to lead G20 countries in vaccination rates with approximately 80% of eligible Canadians vaccinated with their first dose and over 50% of eligible Canadians fully vaccinated. He said case numbers and severe illness continue to decline across the country as vaccination rates continue to increase.
coronavirus,Trudeau spoke with leaders of Canada’s provinces and his office released a readout of the call. He noted that if Canada’s current positive path of vaccination rate and public health conditions continue the border can open.
coronavirus,"“Canada would be in a position to welcome fully vaccinated travelers from all countries by early September,” the readout said. “He noted the ongoing discussions with the United States on reopening plans, and indicated that we could expect to start allowing fully vaccinated U.S. citizens and permanent residents into Canada as of mid-August for non-essential travel.”"
coronavirus,"In the early days of the pandemic, the U.S. and Canadian governments closed the more than 5,500-mile (8,800-kilometer) border to nonessential traffic. With increasing vaccination rates and dropping infection rates, some were annoyed the two governments hadn’t laid out detailed plans to fully reopen the border."
coronavirus,"Health officials have stressed that even amid the surge in cases linked to the delta variant, vaccines remain the best method to combat serious illness and death. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, has continued to urge Americans to get vaccinated, and figures show that almost all of the nation’s COVID-19 deaths are among people who remain unvaccinated."
coronavirus,"Canada began easing its restrictions earlier this month, allowing fully vaccinated Canadians or permanent legal residents to return Canada without quarantining. But among the requirements are a negative test for the virus before returning, and another once they get back."
coronavirus,The U.S. Travel Association estimates that each month the border is closed costs $1.5 billion. Canadian officials say Canada had about 22 million foreign visitors in 2019 — about 15 million of them from the United States.
coronavirus,"Major League Baseball and the Toronto Blue Jays are hoping to win an exemption to allow for home games to be played in Toronto starting July 30. Allowing unvaccinated players into the country remains a sticking point but protocols will be put in place. The Blue Jays played home games during the shortened 2020 season in Buffalo, New York and started this season in Dunedin, Florida, before moving to Buffalo."
coronavirus,"Pressure has been mounting on Canada to continue to ease the restrictions at the border, which have been in effect since March of last year."
coronavirus,Providing exemptions for travel into Canada amid the pandemic is politically sensitive and Trudeau is expected to call a federal election next month.
coronavirus,Trudeau said his ministers would share more details on the border early next week.
coronavirus,"Tom Webb, a 63-year-old retired US navy pilot from Orchard Park, New York, said he’s seriously thinking of selling his cottage in Georgian Bay, Ontario after not being to access it for almost two years. He is vaccinated. “I am beyond frustrated,” he said."
coronavirus,Commercial traffic has gone back and forth normally between the two countries since the start of the pandemic. Canadians are able to fly into the United States with a negative COVID-19 test.
coronavirus,Canadian officials have said they would like 75% of eligible Canadian residents to be fully vaccinated before loosening border restrictions for tourists and business travelers. The Canadian government expects to have enough vaccine delivered for 80% of eligible Canadians to be fully vaccinated by the end of July. The U.S. only allowed for exports of vaccines into Canada in early May.
coronavirus,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits has reached its lowest level since the pandemic struck last year, further evidence that the U.S. economy and job market are quickly rebounding from the pandemic recession.Thursday’s report from the Labor Department showed that jobless claims fell by 26,000 last week to 360,000. The weekly tally, a proxy for layoffs, has fallen more or less steadily since topping 900,000 in early January.The U.S. recovery from the recession is proceeding so quickly that many forecasters have predicted that the economy will expand this year by roughly 7%. That would be the most robust calendar-year growth since 1984.The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has sharply reduced new viral cases — from a seven-day average of around 250,000 in early January to roughly 25,000 recently — despite a recent uptick. As the health crisis has receded, cooped-up Americans have increasingly emerged from their homes, eager to spend on things they had missed during pandemic lockdowns — dinners out, a round of drinks, sports and entertainment events, vacation getaways and shopping trips.In response, businesses have scrambled to meet the unexpected surge in customer demand: They are posting job openings — a record 9.2 million in May — faster than they can fill them. The worker shortage in many industries is causing employers to raise wages and in some cases to raise prices to offset their higher labor costs.The supply of potential hires is being held back by a variety of factors. Many Americans still have health concerns about working around large numbers of people. Many people, mostly women, are no longer working or looking for work because they had to care for children when schools and day care centers shut down. And roughly 2.6 million older workers took advantage of enlarged stock portfolios and home values to retire early.A temporary $300-a-week federal unemployment benefit, on top of regular state jobless aid, may be enabling some people to be more selective in looking for and taking jobs. Roughly half the states plan to stop paying the supplement by the end of July in what proponents say is an effort to nudge more of the unemployed to seek jobs.Last month, employers added a hefty 850,000 jobs, and hourly pay rose a solid 3.6% compared with a year ago — faster than the pre-pandemic annual pace and evidence that companies are being compelled to pay more to attract and keep workers. Even so, the United States remains about 6.8 million jobs short of the number it had in February 2020, just before the virus erupted across the country and paralyzed the economy.And weekly applications for unemployment benefits remain high by historical standards: Just before the pandemic, they amounted to about 220,000 a week. All told, 13.8 million Americans were receiving some type of unemployment aid during the week of June 26, down from 30.6 million a year earlier."

coronavirus,Not exactly the once-in-a-lifetime experience many athletes were envisioning.
coronavirus,"Welcome to the no-fun Olympics, where celebrations and camaraderie will be muted by stringent rules and regulations due to the coronavirus pandemic."
coronavirus,Navigating the Tokyo Games may prove to be anything but a piece of cake: Masks and social distancing — 2 meters (more than 6 feet) — strictly required. Hugging is a no-no when celebrating. Meals in big groups are to be avoided. Alcohol must be consumed in one’s room — and alone. Family interactions are basically reduced to video chatting.
coronavirus,"The lengthy playbook — a guideline for a “safe and successful Games” — is filled with “cannots” and “do nots.” Slip-ups and their consequences range from warnings to fines to maybe even worse — expulsion? — for the approximately 15,400 athletes expected to take part in the Olympics and Paralympics."

coronavirus,Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued a stark warning to the nation on Thursday about the ongoing spread of COVID-19 misinformation.
coronavirus,"In his first advisory since he was appointed by President Joe Biden, Murthy said that the U.S. had come a long way in its battle against the pandemic. However, disinformation campaigns remained the biggest hurdle to see the nation move past the coronavirus."
coronavirus,He also called out tech companies for failing to rein in anti-vaccination posts that pose an “imminent and insidious threat to our nation’s health.”
coronavirus,"Surgeon General advisories are typically reserved for urgent public health threats. Past ones have been issued about tobacco, opioid addiction and suicide. Murthy’s latest warning comes amid an uptick in COVID-19 cases around the U.S., primarily due to the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant of the virus."
coronavirus,"“Modern technology companies have enabled misinformation to poison our information environment with little accountability to their users,” Murthy said Thursday at the White House. “They’ve designed product features, such as ‘Like’ buttons, that reward us for sharing emotionally charged content, not accurate content. And their algorithms tend to give us more of what we click on, pulling us deeper and deeper into a well of misinformation.”"
coronavirus,"Although more than 160 million people are now fully vaccinated against the coronavirus in the U.S., regions with lower inoculation rates are particularly vulnerable to the delta strain. And despite the high transmissibility of the delta variant, vaccines have proven to be effective at preventing the severe illness and death associated with COVID-19."
coronavirus,Almost all of the nation’s coronavirus deaths are among people who remain unvaccinated.
coronavirus,"In the advisory, Murthy said misinformation had hindered the country’s effort to see Americans vaccinated. He revealed that he had lost 10 family members to COVID-19, and said it was painful to know that many of the latest deaths in the U.S. could have been prevented by vaccinations."
coronavirus,"Major social media companies, including Facebook and Twitter, have taken steps to remove or minimize the spread of false COVID-19 claims. But misinformation has remained rampant throughout the pandemic, both at home and abroad."
coronavirus,The White House added Thursday that it was disappointed with Facebook’s efforts to stop the major peddlers of misinformation. Press secretary Jen Psaki said there were about a dozen accounts responsible for a vast majority of anti-vaccine misinformation and they were all still posting on the platform.
coronavirus,"“Facebook has repeatedly shown that they have the levers to promote quality information,” Psaki said during a press briefing. “We’ve seen them effectively do this in their algorithm over low-quality information and they’ve chosen not to use it in this case.”"
coronavirus,"The astonishing number is double the cases of the previous week and four times the cases in mid-June, according to statistics from the Florida Health Department."
coronavirus,"COVID-19 cases in Florida soared to close to 46,000 this week, accounting for 20% of all new cases in the nation."
coronavirus,"The health department also reported 231 new deaths, up from 172 the week ending July 9, according to The Orlando Sentinel."
coronavirus,"States with the highest outbreaks now also include Nevada, Missouri and Arkansas, which all have low vaccination rates of about 50% of the population with at least one dose. Arkansas and Missouri are tallying more cases now than they did in the winter. Some rural areas have vaccination rates as low as 20%."
coronavirus,"In Florida, 59% of resident have had at least one dose. States with rates of 70% or more are faring much better."
coronavirus,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky in a press briefing at the White House Friday called the outbreaks a “pandemic of the unvaccinated.” (See the video below.)
coronavirus,"The nation is now averaging about 26,000 cases per day, a nearly 70% hike from the previous seven-day average, according to Walensky. Hospitalizations are up to about 2,790 per day — a 36% increase over the previous week — and deaths are up 26% to 211 per day."
coronavirus,President Joe Biden on Friday criticized social media for spreading vaccine disinformation that’s costing lives. 
coronavirus,"The vaccinated remain relatively safe, she said, while the unvaccinated are “at risk.” Of those recently hospitalized with COVID-19, 97% are unvaccinated, Walensky added."
coronavirus,"“Our biggest concern is we are going to continue to see preventable cases, hospitalizations and, sadly, deaths among the unvaccinated,” she said."
coronavirus,Walensky said states with soaring cases might consider reinstating indoor mask mandates.
coronavirus,"“They’re killing people,” he said. “The only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated. And they’re killing people.”"
coronavirus,"Facebook responded with a statement saying: “The fact is that more than two billion people have viewed authoritative information about COVID-19 and vaccines on Facebook, which is more than any other place on the internet.”"

Tokyo officials including Seiko Hashimoto, the president of the organizing committee, confirmed the case and said the positive test was Friday. Organizers say for confidentiality purposes they can only offer a vague description and few details."
coronavirus,"“In the current situation, that positive cases arise is something we must assume is possible,” said Toshiro Muto, the CEO of the Tokyo organizing committee."
coronavirus,The person is identified simply as a “games-concerned personnel.” The person is also listed as a non-resident of Japan. Tokyo officials said the person was placed in a 14-day quarantine.
coronavirus,"The Olympic Village on Tokyo Bay will house about 11,000 athletes during the Olympics and thousands of other staff."
coronavirus,IOC President Thomas Bach said this week there was “zero” risk of athletes in the village passing on the virus to Japanese or other residents of the village.
coronavirus,"Organizers say since July 1 and as of Saturday, 44 people under their “jurisdiction” have tested positive. None involved people living in the village and most are identified as “contractors” for Tokyo 2020 and “games-concerned personnel.” The list includes one athlete — who tested positive on July 14 — and three members of the media."
coronavirus,"Of the 44, only 12 are listed as “non-resident of Japan.”"
coronavirus,Organizers say that athletes and staff who have been away from Tokyo at training camps are excluded from this list and their accounting.

coronavirus,"“Health misinformation is a serious threat to public health,” Murthy said in the advisory. “It can cause confusion, sow mistrust, harm people’s health and undermine public health efforts.

money,"Starting Thursday, most American families will start receiving a check for as much as $300 per child every month through the end of this year, as part of the $2 trillion American Rescue Plan’s expansion of the child tax credit that congressional Democrats passed in March."
money,"The first set of payments, amounting to $15 billion this month to be sent out by the IRS, will reach more than 35 million American households, covering just under 88% of children in the United States, according to a White House official. "
money,Here’s what you need to know about the program.
money,History of the child tax credit and how it has changed
money,"Republicans, however, have been reluctant to change the tax credit into anything that resembled welfare or a direct-cash benefit. They doubled the child tax credit in their 2017 Tax Cuts And Jobs Act to $2,000 a year through 2025, but limited how much of the credit could go toward increasing a family’s cash refund."
money,"The U.S. has had a version of the child tax credit since the late 1990s. But it’s always been small. It began as a $400 credit in 1997 and has gradually increased since. And it was focused on reducing taxes. As such, it didn’t put much extra cash into families’ pockets. "
money,"Democrats increased the credit to as much as $3,600 per child and made it fully refundable. All American families with incomes up to $400,000, including those that don’t make enough money to pay taxes at all, can receive the benefit. And Democrats told the IRS to distribute the credit in advance, as monthly checks through December."
money,"Families with a joint income of less than $150,000 will receive $3,600 per child under the age of 6, and up to $3,000 for children between ages 6 and 17, in 2021. Every child under the age of 17, born by the end of 2021 is eligible. Distributed monthly through December, eligible families will receive $300 per month for each child under age 6, and $250 for kids 6 to 17. The payments will be made on the 15th of each month, unless that date falls on a weekend or holiday."
money,What families should expect
money,"Then the coronavirus pandemic happened. Suddenly, Republicans and Democrats were signing on to direct cash payments — the stimulus checks. When Democrats won full control of Congress and the White House, they also made changes they had long wanted to the child tax credit."
money,"Children have long suffered the highest poverty rate of any age group in the country. For nearly two decades, Democrats have sought to not only increase the benefit, but to transform the tax credit into something that could also help the very poor. "
money,The remaining credit will be distributed when families file their 2021 tax returns.
money,"You can get this tax credit even if you don’t pay taxes, but there’s an extra step"
money,"Families that do want the payments in advance, but have relied on the child tax credit in the past to reduce their tax liability, should budget accordingly. The money from the credit itself does not count as income, and therefore isn’t taxed. But because money will be paid in advance, some families might want to change their tax withholdings so they’re not surprised by a bigger tax bill next April."
money,"If families don’t want to receive the credits incrementally and in advance, and would rather get the entire amount when they file their 2021 taxes, they can choose to opt out of receiving monthly advance payments through the IRS website. "
money,"This money will be automatically sent to families that file taxes. But parents with incomes so low they don’t need to file taxes must use a separate online portal to sign up for the benefit, unless they received the stimulus checks earlier this year."
money,"The White House says it is working on making the portal more accessible, but did not put a timeline on when those changes would be made."
money,"Some parents have had issues with the government website. It requires having an email address before inputting any personal information, is only in English and, for most people, only works on desktop computers or laptops. The online tool looks identicato the government website the IRS used last year to distribute stimulus checks to this same population."
money,"Two-earner households earning more than $150,000 and up to $400,000 annually will receive periodic payments as well, totaling $2,000 per child. "
money,Most families that regularly pay taxes or received the stimulus checks in the last year and a half will receive these monthly payments automatically and don’t need to sign up for anything.
money,"Reaching this low-to-no-income population will be a major challenge for the IRS, which has partnered with the Social Security Administration and other government departments to get information on families that don’t have to pay taxes."
money,You can check your eligibility for the tax credit with this IRS survey.
money,"If the government succeeds in reaching these people and delivering their checks, this policy has the potential to cut child poverty in the United States in half."
money,"As Democrats negotiate a special package of policies to help American families, however, cost will be a factor. And it’s possible the extension could be shortened even further."
money,"In a statement last month, the legislators called the program “the most significant policy to come out of Washington in generations,” and said “Congress has an historic opportunity to provide a lifeline to the middle class and to cut child poverty in half on a permanent basis.” "
money,This expanded version of the child tax credit is set to expire in 2021. 
money,"President Joe Biden has been reluctant to advocate for it to be made permanent, likely because of the cost. Instead, the White House proposes to extend this expanded child tax credit through 2025, when some Republican tax changes are set to expire as well. "
money,"That said, Democrats designed this credit in such a way that allowing it to fully expire will be politically very costly. Not only is this child tax credit fully refundable so that poor families can benefit and child poverty can be cut, Democrats increased the benefit overall. Letting the credit expire essentially increases taxes on people who had been receiving the credit, including those in the middle class."
money,"A group of Democratic lawmakers, including Reps. Suzan DelBene (Wash.), Rosa DeLauro (Conn.) and Ritchie Torres (N.Y.), along with Sens. Sherrod Brown (Ohio), Cory Booker (N.J.) and Michael Bennet (Colo.), has been lobbying Biden to agree to a permanent expansion of the child tax credit."
money,"Democrats, who narrowly control the House of Representatives and Senate, are trying to pass the progressive policy without Republican votes through a maneuver known as reconciliation, which allows them to act with just a simple 51-vote majority rather than the chamber’s normal 60-vote requirement."
money,"Regardless of the ruling, the idea of raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2025 from its current $7.25 is broadly popular, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found. Some 59% of respondents said they supported the idea, with 34% opposing it."
money,This is only through 2021 — for now
money,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A majority of Americans support the idea of more than doubling the minimum wage to $15 per hour, a Reuters/Ipsos poll showed on Thursday as Senate Democrats await a ruling on whether they can tuck that measure into a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill."
money,"Two Senate Republicans, Tom Cotton and Mitt Romney, on Tuesday proposed increasing the minimum wage to $10 an hour."
money,The Senate’s parliamentarian on Thursday is expected to decide whether the rules will allow them to use the coronavirus spending bill to enact a sweeping wage policy.
money,"When told that “raising the minimum wage should lift some families out of poverty, but government economists also expect it could eliminate some low income jobs, potentially making some families worse off,” 55% of respondents said they supported it."
money,"Even if the Senate parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, rules that the minimum wage can be passed through reconciliation, it will not change the fact that the proposal faces an uphill battle in the Senate."
money,"There is broader support in the Senate to raising the minimum wage by a lesser amount, and not through reconciliation."
money,"The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States between Feb. 18 and Feb. 24. It gathered responses from 4,430 adults, including 2,158 who identified as Democrats and 1,482 who identified as Republicans. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of plus or minus 3 percentage points."
money,About 40% of American adults said that they would benefit – either personally or through a member of their family – if the U.S. raised the federal minimum wage.
money,Democrats are not united in support with two of their number - Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona - against the idea.

money,"Retirement experts have been warning for years that more than 1 million workers and retirees could lose their pensions if Congress doesn’t act. Now help from Washington might finally arrive, thanks to an unlikely legislative opening provided by the pandemic."
money,"Congressional Democrats are moving a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan through a process known as budget reconciliation, hoping to send it to President Joe Biden’s desk this month. A proposal to shore up troubled pension plans and the federal agency that insures them may end up hitching a ride on that package, saving retirees from having their pensions cut."
money,"The idea of bailing out pension funds through the coronavirus relief package will certainly draw criticism from Republicans. In a hearing held Wednesday by the House Ways and Means Committee, Rep. Kevin Hern (Okla.) said the proposal doesn’t belong in a bill addressing stimulus payments, unemployment benefits and vaccination efforts."
money,"“It’s been a long, hard struggle,” said John Murphy, vice president of the Teamsters, a union with one of the most threatened pension funds. “We’re on the 5-yard line, it’s first down and goal, and I like our chances.”"
money,"The pension funds in trouble are called multiemployer plans. Anywhere from a small handful to hundreds of employers contribute to such plans, with the amounts negotiated through union contracts. The plans are common in fields like construction, trucking and mining, where workers often change employers but take their pensions with them. "
money,"“I don’t see how a blank check to unions will defeat the virus and reopen the economy,” Hern said. “I wish Republicans had been consulted on this bill.”"
money,"If the PBGC’s insurance program for multiemployer funds went under, retirees and their spouses could end up getting pennies on the dollar for benefits they worked their entire careers for. Some could even fall into poverty."
money,"Although most of the 1,400 such plans out there are fine, around 130 of them have fallen into dire shape, with fewer union employers contributing to them. Those plans cover roughly 1.3 million people, and some are on track to become insolvent within just a few years. Their failure could wreak havoc on the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the government-run entity that backstops pension benefits. "
money,"The reconciliation process would allow Democrats to pass a package in the Senate with a simple majority, avoiding a filibuster that would normally require 60 votes to overcome. The House is already considering the pension proposal in its version of the relief bill. If the Senate includes the measure and it survives under reconciliation rules, a lot of retirees will be celebrating."
money,"Unions and their Democratic allies have fought for several years to pass such a pension fix, but were blocked by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) when he was Senate majority leader. (McConnell and Republicans passed a narrower, bipartisan bill that safeguarded the pensions of coal miners.) Now, however, Democrats control the House and have the barest of majorities in the Senate, with 50 seats and Vice President Kamala Harris available to cast a tie-breaking vote."
money,"“Pensions are part of the security and protection we need as we grow older and retire from the world of work,” Davis said. Including the legislation in the relief package “would give assurances to thousands of retirees that their pension is safe and secure,” he added. "
money,"Democrats in the House passed a multiemployer pension bill with some Republican support in 2019 and have been crafting a version they believe complies with the rules of budget reconciliation. The legislation’s main backers include Rep. Bobby Scott, chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, and Rep. Richard Neal (Mass.), the Ways and Means chair. "
money,"The legislation they’re considering now would provide direct assistance, rather than loans, to the troubled plans through the PBGC. The cost of that assistance would be offset somewhat by increases in insurance premiums paid to the PBGC for single-employer pension plans. "
money,"A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond Thursday when asked if Biden would support the inclusion of the multiemployer legislation in the coronavirus relief package. Still, it is hard to see Biden opposing it if the measure draws enough support in the Senate and passes muster with the Senate parliamentarian, who interprets the rules under budget reconciliation."
money,"The total cost would come to an estimated $65 billion. Democrats say the plan would secure the pension funds for at least 30 years, preventing cuts to benefits for retirees. "
money,"Democrats argue that not reinforcing the funds will come with its own financial costs down the road when the government has to support those pensioners through social assistance programs. Pension payments are also taxed. Citing an estimate from a trade group for multiemployer plans, Scott’s office said a failure of the plans could cost $170 billion over 10 years due to lost tax revenue and spending through programs like housing and food assistance."
money,"One of the main reasons that particular Teamsters plan is in such rough shape is the decline of unions in the trucking industry. In 1982, the pension plan had two active participants for every inactive one drawing benefits. But now there are five people drawing benefits for every active participant, causing the fund to run out of money."
money,"“I fully expect President Biden to throw his support and weight behind adding this pension bill to the COVID-19 relief package,” said Murphy of the Teamsters. “Hopefully, we get this across the finish line. But it will be like lifting an albatross off more than a million people, most of whom are senior citizens.”"
money,But Rep. Danny Davis (D-Ill.) countered that protecting pensions has everything to do with fortifying the economy.
money,"Dale Hanner, a former diesel mechanic and Teamster, told HuffPost in 2019 that he knew of one woman who relied on the $385 per month from her pension to buy insulin. "
money,"“This is going to devastate people,” Hanner said of the looming insolvency. “It’s going to put them in survival mode, and I don’t think Congress understands that.”"
money,"Getting such a measure through the Senate would be trickier, but there are reasons for Democrats and unions to be optimistic. For starters, the cost would be lumped into a much larger, nearly $2 trillion package that voters by and large support. It would also eliminate a political and economic problem that will need to be dealt with soon regardless, due to the scope of the pension crisis. "
money,"“We can protect retirees’ hard-earned pensions and spare folks a lot of harm, or we can kick the can further down the road and end up costing the taxpayers far more in the long run,” Scott told HuffPost through a spokesperson."
money,"The benefits included in multiemployer plans tend to be modest and are often crucial to recipients’ ability to cover their basic living expenses. The average annual benefit in the Teamsters’ Central States plan ― the largest multiemployer plan in trouble, with some 400,000 participants ― is around $15,000. Because those pensions were negotiated as part of contracts, workers essentially forwent pay under the expectation the pensions would be there later."
money,"At the current pace, the PBGC projects that its multiemployer program would become insolvent sometime in 2026. If that happened, both Democrats and Republicans would have to answer to working-class constituents whose retirements were being upended. For that reason, moderate Democrats and even some Republicans who’ve fretted over the price tag of the relief package might choose not to stand in the way of a pension rescue."
money,"The bill includes $1,400 payments for most adults and for each of their dependents. That means households will receive much larger payments than Congress delivered in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act in March 2020, which paid $1,200 per adult but only $500 per child. "
money,"This week, the Senate is expected to take up and pass President Joe Biden’s massive $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, the fifth major piece of legislation to be considered since the pandemic began about a year ago."
money,Democrats are about to make it rain. 
money,"The average CARES rebate for tax filers in the middle 20% of earners was $1,642, according to the conservative Tax Foundation, while middle-earning households will get $2,431 on average from the new bill."
money,"A family of four earning less than $150,000 stands to receive $5,600 in direct payments from the bill, compared to $3,400 from the CARES Act. (Two-earner households earning above $200,000 will get nothing.) "
money,"A family of four with $100,000 of income would have received $9,500 in rebate checks and tax credits in 2020, but it also stands to receive $22,600 this year from the December bill, plus the additional payments and tax credits in the new bill, according to Marc Goldwein, an economist with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget."
money,"The new bill would also tack on $400 per week in added federal unemployment benefits, which will start to expire March 14 if Congress fails to act, plus hundreds of billions of dollars for schools, restaurants and coronavirus vaccine distribution."
money,"Already, the $600 payments and extra unemployment benefits from the December bill pushed poverty down in January, according to researchers. "
money,"Democrats conceived of the forthcoming payments as a follow-up to the smaller $600 checks Congress sent as part of a compromise bill in December, since Biden and then-Democratic Senate candidates in Georgia had promised they would support $2,000 checks."
money,"A $15 minimum wage hike is unlikely to be included in the bill, however. The Senate parliamentarian ruled last week that lawmakers can’t increase the minimum wage through the budget reconciliation process, the legislative maneuver that would allow Democrats to pass legislation with a simple majority. Progressives are calling on Democrats to overrule the parliamentarian ― but doing so would require 51 votes, an unlikely scenario."
money,"White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week that Biden “respects the parliamentarian’s decision and the Senate’s process,” signaling that the administration isn’t girding for a messy fight that could delay passage of the bill."
money,"“My guess is it’s probably gonna change, but pretty modestly,” Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) told reporters after the meeting. "
money,"It’s possible that lawmakers eventually agree to a more modest increase to the minimum wage, which currently stands at $7.25 and has not been raised for more than a decade. Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a key moderate, is supportive of an $11 minimum wage. Several Republicans have also floated minimum wage increases. Democrats will need GOP support to pass a stand-alone minimum wage hike, which requires 60 votes to overcome a filibuster."
money,"The package also includes big expansions of tax credits that will send another $3,600 per child under the age of 6 to the poorest households, though it’s unclear if the cash will arrive as a lump sum during next year’s tax season or as advance monthly payments starting this summer. Experts say the money would put a huge dent in child poverty."
money,"A group of centrist Democrats met virtually with Biden on Monday to discuss changes to the bill, including adding guardrails to a $350 billion fund for state and local governments. Several attendees expressed hope that the fund includes dedicated aid for more rural communities, as well as additional funding to expand broadband internet connectivity."
money,"“Very few people look at all the specifics. I think what they understand is there’s more money ― and we do need more money to help people ― but they look a little more deeply and realize the bill needs to be improved. And that’s what I’m trying to do,” Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told HuffPost when asked about the polling data."
money,"Once the Senate passes the bill, it will go back to the House for another vote before being sent to Biden’s desk for his signature. Democrats are racing to pass the bill in a few weeks to prevent the lapse in added unemployment benefits and boost vaccine distribution for millions of Americans."
money,"The final details of the $1.9 trillion package will be hashed out later this week when senators are given an opportunity to offer amendments during a marathon session in the chamber. Democrats will need to stay completely united, a major challenge in an evenly divided 50-50 Senate."
money,"So far, no Republicans are expected to support the bill, which passed last week in the Democratic-controlled House on a party-line vote. GOP attempts to brand the legislation as a payoff to progressives full of wasteful spending haven’t had much success. Polls show wide support for Biden’s plan, including among a majority of Republican voters."
money,"Republican lawmakers acknowledge that Biden’s plan contains popular elements, but they argue that other items need to be trimmed substantially. In particular, they object to sending hundreds of billions in aid to schools and state and local governments."
money,"Rykiel, 33, does the family’s taxes, so she was well aware that the child tax credit benefited her family even before Democrats dramatically expanded it as part of the American Rescue Plan. She’s glad to receive the money as advance monthly payments instead of a lump sum at tax time."
money,"“We should listen to our voters. And the majority of the American people, the overwhelming majority of the American people and of both parties, are urging us to act,” Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) told CNN on Sunday. “We’re moving ahead with a bill that probably will get no Republican votes in the Senate, but will have broad Republican support in the country.”"
money,"Democrats increased the value of the credit from $2,000 per child to $3,600, made it more refundable so families could get the full amount as cash, and told the IRS to pay the money in advance monthly installments through the rest of 2021."
money,"The monthly payments are a huge undertaking that the IRS initially said might be impossible on such short notice, but the agency has now told the vast majority of parents to expect payments starting July 15 unless they opt out."
money,"In recent years, more and more congressional Democrats have come around to the idea that the federal government should support parents and try to reduce child poverty with the kind of monthly payments that are typical in every other advanced country. After Congress responded to the coronavirus pandemic with two rounds of direct payments to almost everyone in America, Democrats seized the moment."
money,"The money hasn’t even hit Marla Snead’s bank account yet, and she’s already worried about what it will mean for her daughter when the benefit runs dry at the end of this year. "
money,"“When you get a lump sum, you don’t tend to spend it as intentionally,” she said. “With a monthly amount, you can budget it a little better.”"
money,"“I think they realized that, with the stimulus checks during the pandemic, that ‘People really like it when we help them,’” Rykiel said."
money,"Ally Rykiel of Chico, California, should receive $550 per month for her two kids, ages 5 and 11. She plans to spend it on school supplies, clothes and shoes they’ll need before school starts in the fall. The money will also help with taekwondo classes and swimming lessons that had previously been a burden."
money,"Democrats expanded the benefit for only one year in the American Rescue Plan. President Joe Biden, who originally supported making the benefit permanent, has proposed a four-year extension. The plan is to include the proposal in the second half of Democrats’ infrastructure push, which will address what they’re calling “human infrastructure,” such as child care and education."
money,"Duncan was a nanny for 30 years in New York City, until the family she worked for moved away. Finding nannying jobs has been hard, she said, and unemployment insurance is only temporary. In the past year, her son and her husband both contracted COVID-19, and her husband lost his job. He has been brought back on, but only part-time."
money,"Snead, a 52-year-old single mother of a 14-year-old from Chesapeake, West Virginia, has been on Social Security Disability Insurance since 2008. She’s had two failed back surgeries and fought through a cancer diagnosis. There are days when she can’t walk. Excluding food, her expenses, like a car payment, rent, utilities, phone and internet, make up roughly three-quarters of the income she has from Social Security."
money,"“I have to put it in [the budget] because there’s nothing else,” Duncan said. “I have a 13-year-old I have to feed and he’s going to go into high school in September, and I have to budget to buy clothes for him. We have been hit so hard with COVID.”"
money,"If the government can reach America’s poorest families, the child tax credit will go a long way toward alleviating child poverty in the United States. If fully implemented, Democrats say, the tax credit would cut child poverty in half. "
money,"“They grow out of their clothes so fast,” she said. “Transportation. There’s all this stuff we have to prepare for.”"
money,She hasn’t seen child support from her ex-husband in years. 
money,"The IRS has notified millions of parents that they will soon receive monthly payments worth as much as $300 per child, and some have already made plans for the money."
money,"She’s budgeting the money from the tax credit exclusively for her daughter’s needs: food, school supplies, books, feminine products."
money,"“I don’t understand why this isn’t going to be until the child is 18 instead of the end of the year,” Snead said. “Every year as they get older, their needs become more.” "
money,"LaFleur Duncan, a 53-year-old mom in Brooklyn, New York, said she has no choice but to budget in the child tax credit to cover everyday expenses. She’ll be receiving $250 a month through December for her 13-year-old son."
money,"And, Snead said, she’s hoping there will be a little left over for a treat here and there this summer."
money,“Right now I can’t even literally afford a package of loose-leaf paper for her.”
money,"“She loves that Korean K-pop group BTS,” Snead said. “They have a BTS McDonald’s meal right now, which is nothing but a chicken nugget meal, but it’s them and she wants that. But I don’t have McDonald’s money.”"

money,"Venmo announced the decision Tuesday, Bloomberg reported."
money,"“As part of our ongoing efforts to continually evolve the Venmo platform, while staying true to the heart of the Venmo experience, we are removing the global feed,” the company said in a statement provided to Bloomberg. “This change allows customers to connect and share meaningful moments and experiences with the people who matter most.”"
money,"
Venmo, which is owned by PayPal, said Tuesday that users will still have to ability to control their friends list and will be able to see transactions among friends. Users can also continue to block other Venmo customers.
Customer complaints against some digital payment services, including Venmo, CashApp and Zelle, were up sharply in the first few months of 2021 compared to the same period last year. People encountered issues ranging from scams to poor customer service, according to a report by the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. (The higher number of complaints may be due in part to an overall increase in people using contactless payment services, following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.)
Venmo, for its part, appears to be strengthening its efforts to improve security and crack down on fraud.
"
money,"
On Friday, following a passing mention in the New York Times that the president had sent his grandchildren money on Venmo, BuzzFeed News searched for the president’s account using only a combination of the app’s built-in search tool and public friends feature. In the process, BuzzFeed News found nearly a dozen Biden family members and mapped out a social web that encompasses not only the first family, but a wide network of people around them, including the president’s children, grandchildren, senior White House officials, and all of their contacts on Venmo.
"
money,"The payment app Venmo will no longer feature its global social feed, which had allowed users to see payments between people they don’t know."
money,"Previously, users could see publicly shared payments between strangers. In May, an explosive report by BuzzFeed News demonstrated just how easy it was to track down information from Venmo users, including President Joe Biden. From that report:"
money,"Julie Evans thought she’d get a refund from the IRS this year, so she got to work on her taxes first thing in January. A former administrative assistant, Evans was out of work for all of 2020. To save money, she is living with her adult children in Kent, Washington, and scraping by on unemployment benefits. “The idea of $400 or so [refund] was enticing,” she said. "
money,"Instead, Evans got a shock: a $1,600 tax bill. “I don’t know where I’m going to come up with the money,” the 59-year-old told HuffPost."
money,"Perversely, because of the relative generosity of the benefits passed by Congress last spring ― $600 a week on top of state benefits ― tax bills might reach into the thousands of dollars, according to a report released by The Century Foundation last week, as well as conversations HuffPost had with unemployed workers."
money,"The U.S. is about to face what has to be one of the more nonsensical policy failures of the pandemic: Millions of Americans, already struggling financially, could be hit with a huge tax bill because they received unemployment insurance last year."
money,"“It doesn’t seem logical,” he said."
money,"So he’s been waiting, hoping federal lawmakers would act to help him, first, by extending the $600 additional unemployment payments, or at least paying some of that retroactively — a policy conversation that seems to have vanished, he pointed out. "
money,"For many, the bills will come as a surprise: Who would think that the government would tax the money it provided to help people avoid going broke? "
money,"Households could see tax bills between $1,000 and $2,000, said Brian Galle, a professor at Georgetown Law School and the report’s co-author. Some bills could reach as high as $3,000; others may not owe money but won’t get the refunds they’re expecting. "
money,"If he winds up getting a stimulus check this year, O’Brien said he’ll have to use it to pay his taxes."
money,"“No one cares,” he said. “We’re all out here deep in debt.” And it’s not like it’s his fault, he added: “They literally closed the economy down for a year.”"
money,"Shannon O’Brien, 48, lost his job as a bartender in a casino near Albany, New York, when the shutdown began in March 2020. When he sketched out his taxes last month, O’Brien was surprised to find he owes $1,000 to the federal government and $600 to the state because of his unemployment benefits. "
money,"He’s gone from earning a little more than $1,000 a week — mostly in tips — to getting a couple hundred dollars from the state. He’s thousands of dollars in debt and recently sold his car."
money,"Only a few of his bartender colleagues have been called back to work, since the casino’s bars are mostly still shut down, he said. The only other nearby work option is an Amazon warehouse, but O’Brien cares for his elderly mother and is leery of taking a job that would potentially expose both of them to COVID-19."
money,"In fact, unemployment benefits weren’t taxed at all until 1978, when members of Congress — spurred on by conservative economist Martin Feldstein — expressed worry that if jobless payments weren’t taxed like income, workers would have an “incentive” to remain unemployed. (Feldstein also believed that Social Security discouraged people from saving for retirement, and that tax cuts for the rich trickled down to the working classes.)"
money,"Though states are supposed to ask the unemployed if they want their taxes withheld, there seems to have been a breakdown in the system. Fewer than 40% of states withheld taxes from unemployment checks, Century’s report found. "
money,"The reasoning behind the tax-the-unemployment-benefits theory is wrong. Most people aren’t aware that the payments are taxed in the first place. Plus, research suggests that unemployment benefits — particularly in the U.S., where they’re fairly stingy — don’t keep folks from working. "
money,"But the scale of the unemployment crisis the U.S. faced in 2020 was far worse than the Great Recession. At the peak in April, the unemployment rate hit a record 14.7%. It fell from there, but still millions remained on the job loss rolls, including freelance workers and part-timers who were included as benefits recipients in Congress’s stimulus package in March 2020."
money,"Most of these people still don’t have jobs. “Asking people who are out of work to dig into their pockets and come up with another $3,000 when they’re already having trouble paying rent — this is just a bad combination of events,” Galle said."
money,"The situation is “sort of asinine,” said Elizabeth Pancotti, a policy director at Employ America who co-authored the Century Foundation report. “It seems very silly that you have to pay Uncle Sam when you lose your job. There is no logical and ethical reason why we would tax these benefits.” "
money,She pointed out that other federal benefit programs — like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program — are not taxed like this.
money,"And during a pandemic, much of the point of expanded unemployment benefits was to keep would-be workers at home to prevent the virus from spreading."
money,"In normal times, the taxes on unemployment benefits aren’t a big issue: People are unemployed for a few weeks, and don’t make enough money to owe anything back in taxes. But in a recession, when folks are out of work for longer periods of time, the issue comes up. In 2009, facing this problem, Congress exempted about $2,000 of benefits from taxes."
money,"Some of the problem was that Congress expanded eligibility for benefits, and those newly eligible part-time and contract workers weren’t give the option to withhold money."
money,"It’s a situation that truly doesn’t make much sense, she said. “Unemployment insurance should never be taxed,” she said. “We give money to people to survive, and then we take it back.”"
money,"“This is just another cut of thousands from this pandemic,” said Ford, who also volunteers with an activist group devoted to helping unemployed workers in the pandemic called Extend PUA. (PUA stands for pandemic unemployment assistance, the program that offered benefits to workers who typically don’t qualify for unemployment insurance.)"
money,"That’s what happened to 29-year-old Sarah Ford, who was working in events production in New York when the pandemic hit and has been out work ever since, picking up some freelance gigs here and there. She asked for taxes to be taken out of her unemployment checks from the start (an option that not all filers had last year), but she still owes $2,000 in city taxes. Her partner, who was also unemployed in 2020, owes $650."
money,"Evans, the Washington woman, said she’s hoping to pay her taxes in installments, and that she’d probably use additional stimulus money for car payments, food and rent for the facility where she’s storing her furniture and belongings."
money,"Most people are in less of a hurry to file. Workers are already starting to panic, said Stephanie Freed, the 32-year-old co-founder of Extend PUA. People she’s spoken with are putting off doing their taxes because they can’t afford to pay the bill."
money,"Policymakers should’ve seen this coming, Pancotti said. Forgiving these taxes was a decision the Treasury Department could have made under former President Donald Trump. "
money,"Last year, 40 million Americans received unemployment benefits totaling an astonishing $580 billion, the Century Foundation estimated."
money,"Even if money was withheld from unemployment checks, it likely wasn’t enough, and will only cover federal taxes. That means people in places with high local taxes, like New York City, could still be on the hook for more."
money,"“There was no reason to wait until the last minute to do this,” she said. A spokesperson for the Treasury Department declined to comment."
money,"Meanwhile, there are a few lawmakers looking to fix the problem. A bill proposed by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Rep. Cindy Axne (D-Iowa) would exempt the first $10,200 of unemployment money from income tax. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) wants Congress to make sure none of the payments are taxable."
money,Freed herself says she expects to face a tax bill for the unemployment insurance she received last year after losing her job as a production electrician in the entertainment industry. She’s been too afraid to look yet.
money,"The pandemic might have kept these folks out of the workforce, but now these government policy choices could very well keep them in debt, along with all that entails. Evans talked about the fees that pile up when she misses payments on her storage unit; O’Brien is worried about getting to work now that he’s without a car."
money,"Like so many women in the U.S., she’s starting to worry about what’s to come. “I am looking at turning 60 this year and have no appreciable retirement savings or income,” she said. “I was divorced over 20 years ago, and since then, I have been doing every job imaginable in order to support myself and my kids — at times holding three jobs.”"
money,"So far, though, he hasn’t gotten much attention. "
money,"Also, if Congress does pass something, it could take months to wind its way through the system, forcing people to pay their tax bills then file amended claims to try and get the money back."
money,"A quicker option lies with the Treasury Department, Galle said. He pointed to a law that exempts disaster relief money from federal taxes, and said he’s been pushing for the department to take this route."
money,"These solutions might be untenable, given the cost — which Galle, the Century Foundation report co-author, estimates would be about $20 billion — and the spending limits the Senate faces in trying to pass another COVID-19 relief bill under the limitations of the reconciliation process."
money,Ford said she should be able to pay her tax bill with the money she has coming in from freelance work now.
money,"Democrats are beginning to write President Joe Biden’s proposal for emergency COVID-19 relief into actual legislation, unveiling a bill Monday that covers some of the biggest parts of what is expected to be a $1.9 trillion package."
money,The legislation is a win for progressives who have been fighting against calls from more moderate Democratic and Republican colleagues to reduce the number of families that would receive direct payments by lowering the income eligibility thresholds.
money,"“Just fight for something we need now,” he said."
money,"O’Brien was passionate that this issue should be front and center, instead of the other progressive policy ideas he keeps hearing about, like student loan debt forgiveness or payments to parents."
money,"That includes another round of stimulus checks. Most U.S. households would receive $1,400 per person under the legislation House Ways and Means Chair Richard Neal (D-Mass.) released, though for this third series of checks, Democrats are cutting off higher-income Americans. "
money,"“Our nation is struggling, the virus is still not contained, and the American people are counting on Congress to meet this moment with bold, immediate action,” Neal said in a statement. “From increasing direct assistance to those who need it most to expanding tax credits for low- and middle-income workers, we deliver substantial solutions in this package.”"
money,"Nonetheless, the House bill is a compromise. All individuals making $75,000 or less (and all joint filers earning $150,000 or less) would receive full payments of $1,400, as Biden originally proposed, but the checks will cut off altogether for individuals who make more than $100,000 (or twice that for joint filers). The changes appear to be partly due to the White House’s concerns about higher-earning Americans receiving direct payments. "
money,"The bill also extends federal unemployment programs, but only through August instead of September, as Biden had proposed in his original outline of the COVID-19 relief plan. Current emergency federal unemployment benefits are set to expire in mid-March, which threatens the livelihoods of an estimated 11.2 million Americans, according to one estimate."
money,It’s unclear whether Senate Democrats will keep the exact same structure for direct payments in their coronavirus relief legislation. Both chambers are tasked with writing separate legislation under special budget rules that will allow Democrats to pass the $1.9 trillion package via a simple majority vote. The goal is to merge the two bills and send the final product to Biden’s desk by March. 
money,"It’s become increasingly clear that Republicans aren’t going to sign on to Biden’s proposal, and the White House has been adamant that significantly slimming down the relief package would fail to address the current public health and economic crisis. That means every Senate Democrat has to be on board with the final package to pass it through budget reconciliation."
money,"The legislation tells the Internal Revenue Service to distribute the payments in advance, on a monthly basis, so that the credit essentially becomes a child allowance ― but only if the IRS can handle the task. "
money,"“The risk here is not doing too much, it’s doing too little,” Jared Bernstein, a member of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, told HuffPost last week. "
money,"Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), a key moderate who had called for slimming down portions of the bill, said he was open to the House Democrats’ proposed changes for direct payments."
money,"Republicans and some moderate Democrats have sought to taper down some of Biden’s proposals in recent weeks, spurring backlash from some lawmakers who emphasized that Democrats won the White House and their narrow majority in the Senate on a promise of another round of stimulus checks and a robust emergency package."
money,"Despite concerns about feasibility, Democrats stuck with their child tax credit expansion even after Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) proposed a similar monthly child benefit that would be paid by the Social Security Administration, an agency with a lot more experience paying monthly benefits. "
money,"The House bill also includes a major proposal to expand the child tax credit from $2,000 to $3,600 and make it “fully refundable” so that parents with no income can receive the credit as cash refunds. The extra payments could sharply reduce child poverty. "
money,"The stakes continue to be high. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned over the weekend that the job market was “stalling” in an interview with CBS Sunday. The January jobs report showed meager improvements to the economy and bleak numbers for the job market. The labor force is shrinking, millions remain unemployed, and key industries like retail, health care, transportation and hospitality are still shedding jobs."
money,"A summary of the legislation says the “payments are intended to be delivered on a monthly basis” starting in July, but if the IRS discovers that the job is “infeasible,” then it can “issue the payments as frequently as is feasible.”"
money,Democrats have very little room for error if they want to make good on Biden’s first and most pressing campaign promise and pass these bills before federal benefits programs expire on March 14. 
money,"On Monday, a separate House committee on labor and education also released a bill that covers Biden’s plan to safely reopen schools. It includes $130 billion in funding for ventilation systems, reducing class sizes and obtaining protective gear, among other things. The legislation allocates $39 billion for child care providers to cover costs for families struggling to keep up with tuition."
money,"“As long as we’re targeting to people that really need it,” Manchin told reporters on Monday."
money,"With the March benefits deadline just more than a month away, Democratic-led House committees, like the Ways and Means Committee, which handles all tax-related policy in addition to unemployment programs and benefits for families, are releasing their portions of what will ultimately be the $1.9 trillion package. "
money,"But for now, it looks like House Democrats are going to try to push the policy as far as they can. "
money,"Notably, Democrats included the hotly debated proposal to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next four years — something Manchin has already said he opposes. At this point, it’s not even clear raising the minimum wage complies with Senate rules around budget reconciliation."
worklife,Diana Cejas was working as a resident physician at a New Orleans hospital when doctors discovered a cancerous tumor on her neck.
worklife,"The tumor had grown larger and more painful over time, eventually metastasizing to her lymph nodes. After Cejas had a successful surgery in July 2012 to remove the lymph nodes, she thought that was the end of it — but her troubles were far from over. Twelve hours later, she woke up in the intensive care unit on a ventilator. A stroke had paralyzed the left side of her body."
worklife,"At the time, the then-30-year-old was training in pediatrics. Her workdays were grueling, with some shifts lasting as long as 28 hours. She was used to working up to 80 hours a week, a typical schedule for a pediatric resident. But after the stroke, she found herself taking speech therapy and occupational therapy, and figuring out how to navigate her changed body."
worklife,"About 3% of physicians in the United States identify as having a disability, compared with a quarter of the country’s population, according to a March survey conducted using data from the Association of American Medical Colleges. The most commonly reported disabilities among physicians include chronic health conditions such as cancer, diabetes, cystic fibrosis and asthma, followed by mobility-related disabilities."
worklife,"“It was embarrassing,” said Cejas, who now works as a pediatric neurologist at the Carolina Institute of Developmental Disabilities and as an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina’s School of Medicine. “[The way I was treated during residency] really colored the rest of my training and changed the course of what I had planned for my career.” "
worklife,"Another time, a surgeon yelled at her in front of patients and other doctors because Cejas had sat down during rounds — meetings where medical teams discuss patient care — and “wasn’t speaking loudly enough for his liking,” she recalled. After she informed the surgeon that she’d just had a stroke, he looked “ashamed,” but the damage was done. "
worklife,"She was still dealing with mobility issues and post-stroke fatigue when she resumed her residency just a few short months later, fearing — as many disabled medical residents and students do — that she would fall behind in her program."
worklife,"When she asked for dictation software to help her with note-taking, which she often spent hours into the night catching up on, an administrator brushed her off and told her she just needed to work harder. She learned that some of her colleagues — even those who knew what she’d just gone through — were gossiping behind her back and assumed that she just wanted special treatment, even when she had to leave work to get follow-up scans and bloodwork."
worklife,She tried to push through the pain at first but soon realized she needed disability accommodations. That’s when she noticed a change in the way some co-workers treated her.
worklife,"“I felt like me being out of work was inconveniencing the rest of my team. I felt really ashamed and bad about it, even though I’d just had a stroke,” said Cejas, who is now 39 and has chronic pain, permanent weakness and sensory loss in one of her hands as a result."
worklife,"For decades, the medical field has largely shunned doctors with disabilities, who often face stigma, fear of workplace retaliation and sometimes loss of their jobs or medical licenses. Some disabled doctors switch specialties or leave clinical medicine altogether to move into academia, the business world or other industries. Disability discrimination exists in every professional field, but doctors say the ableism in medicine is heavily intertwined with “grind culture” that expects them to work around the clock. New doctors in particular feel like they have to push themselves to the brink to succeed, regardless of their own well-being."
worklife,"“Medicine expects you as a doctor to be a superhuman,” Cejas said. “Residents and trainees would joke about the fact that ‘I haven’t eaten all day, haven’t peed all day,’ and talk about it as if it’s something we should be proud of. There’s just a really insidious way that we expect doctors to be able to behave, and disability isn’t compatible with that view at all.”"
worklife,"Many of these long-standing issues have recently bubbled up to the surface, in part due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has forced the medical field to contend with the pervasive ableism that has harmed health care workers and the people they take care of. In the last year and a half, health care workers were hailed as “superheroes” even as they were battling a public health crisis, both physically and mentally. Workplace accommodations suddenly became widely available despite the fact that disabled people have been pushing for them for years. Meanwhile, people with disabilities have been deprioritized for vaccines and health care treatments — a practice known as health care rationing."
worklife,"But for many physicians, this is just the beginning."
worklife,"Doctors with disabilities have felt a collective sense of urgency to push these issues to the forefront and use lessons of the pandemic as an opportunity to transform medicine. Their advocacy has led to incremental changes across medical schools, hospitals and influential organizations that set industrywide policies."
worklife,"Wallace Wilson, a physician who has worn a leg brace since childhood, remembers his surgery rotation as a painful period during medical school. The first time he scrubbed in for a procedure, a nurse screamed at him for about 10 minutes after he touched a table where surgical tools had been placed. Wilson said that when the scrub nurse had finished reprimanding him, the surgeon operating on the patient told him, “Get over here. I feel like you’re a bull in a china shop,” while nodding toward Wilson’s leg brace."
worklife,‘I Felt Like A Lab Rat’
worklife,"Wilson is one of more than a dozen disabled doctors and other health care workers who shared their experiences navigating the medical world with HuffPost. Many of them went into great detail about experiencing differential treatment, receiving verbal harassment from co-workers and being dismissed from their jobs after asking for accommodations."
worklife,"“He told me he wanted to see my hands at all times and made me stand at the patient’s ankles while he operated on the patient’s neck with the other medical student,” Wilson told HuffPost."
worklife,"Joanna Bisgrove, who is hard of hearing, recalled a psychologist in her family medicine program who was supposed to be teaching residents about behavioral health. Instead, he spent their one-on-one discussions analyzing her disability and “how my brain worked,” she said."
worklife,"That experience, among many others, led to several years of therapy, and Wilson still has not emotionally recovered. He’s not working in clinical medicine anymore."
worklife,"“I felt like a lab rat,” said Bisgrove, who is now a family physician in Chicago. “There was a power differential in that I didn’t know how to push back against a superior.”"
worklife,"“Oftentimes it’s not what you can do, but what you look like,” said Cheung, a professor in the genetics and pediatrics departments at the medical school. “Being an Asian, being a woman and being someone with a disability, I really do have to work many times harder to satisfy the general professional demands.”"
worklife,"Vivian Cheung, a physician-scientist at the University of Michigan Medical School, said she often feels uncomfortable speaking up when she’s had a relapse of her genetic disease."
worklife,"“For a lot of physicians of color, and trainees and medical students, the bar is so high. We have to be perfect,” said Cejas, who is Black and Latina. “People already expect that you don’t know what you know, they expect you only got in for affirmative action. So you’re having to prove you can do the work, you’re intelligent, you know what you’re saying and doing.”"
worklife,"The level of support you receive also depends on who your supervisor is. Some residents are lucky enough to have an attending physician who is flexible and supportive, while other supervisors may worry about perceived liability risks."
worklife,"“I would say it’s almost random who gets accommodated or supported and who gets rejected or expelled basically from the field. A lot of it has to do with who your boss is,” said Peter Poullos, a radiologist at Stanford Medicine and executive director of the Stanford Medicine Abilities Coalition."
worklife,"“While some conditions may render it impossible for a physician to provide care safely, with appropriate accommodations or treatment, many can responsibly continue to practice, or resume practice once those needs have been met,” the report says. “In carrying out their responsibilities to colleagues, patients, and the public, physicians should strive to employ a process that distinguishes conditions that are permanently incompatible with the safe practice of medicine from those who are not and respond accordingly.”"
worklife,"In medicine, there’s tremendous pressure to strive for perfection, doctors told HuffPost, leaving little room for vulnerability and compassion for those with disabilities and chronic illnesses. For budding physicians, success depends on a lot of factors: workplace culture; geographic location; race, gender identity and socioeconomic status; and how empathetic your colleagues are."
worklife,"The American Medical Association, for example, adopted new guidelines in June that distinguish between physicians with disabilities and “impaired physicians” who can’t practice safely even with accommodations or treatments, rather than assuming disability equals impairment. (It’s worth noting that this can still create an unspoken hierarchy in which some disabilities are viewed as superior to others.) The new guidelines come from a report by the AMA’s Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs, which effectively sets the ethics policies for all of medicine."
worklife,"The guidance also encourages physicians to help eliminate stigma around illness and disability, develop “inclusive training standards that enable individuals with disabilities to enter the profession and have safe, successful careers,” and advocate for accommodations so disabled physicians can continue to provide care."
worklife,"Lisa Meeks, a researcher at the University of Colorado School of Medicine who has been studying disability inclusion in medicine for more than a decade, said these resolutions “will take time to trickle through the system” but that it’s part of a broader effort to ensure all physicians are held to the same standards."
worklife,What Makes A Doctor?
worklife,"“Physicians with disabilities have been invisible for so long, and the new ethical guidelines finally let us be seen,” Bisgrove told HuffPost. “Medical ethics are central to the AMA’s processes and procedures, and so setting anti-ableism into the core of our policy and ethics makes it a foundation on which all other anti-ableism policy can exist.”"
worklife,"“Everyone, regardless of disability, must be able to perform the core competencies of a medical education or the essential functions of a residency or job. This includes doing all of these in a safe manner,” said Meeks, who co-created the digital campaign #DocsWithDisabilities around 2018. “All physicians should be treated the same, and those with disabilities should have appropriate and reasonable accommodations to do so.”"
worklife,"Though the new AMA guidelines are significant, doctors say it’s just one step to breaking down the broad misconception that disability is synonymous with incompetence. That belief is cultivated in them long before they set foot in a hospital."
worklife,"“I’ve had to tell preceptors about my accommodations, and I’ve had them say back to me, ‘Well, if you need this much help, maybe medicine isn’t right for you. Maybe you need to rethink medicine,’” said Wheeler, who has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and other disabilities. "
worklife,"Last year, they co-founded the Alliance of Disabilities and Chronic Illnesses in Medicine, a national advocacy group of more than 70 doctors and medical students fighting for a “more accessible future in medical education,” according to ADACIM’s website."
worklife,"Bisgrove, a member of the AMA’s House of Delegates, said that the guidelines were a “big deal” for doctors with disabilities and that they resulted from a growing collective of delegates speaking out about the need for long-overdue change."
worklife,But the medical field is gradually taking steps to destigmatize disabilities among doctors.
worklife,"For the first two years of medical school at the University of Vermont, Emerson Wheeler navigated classes with multiple invisible disabilities. Wheeler, who uses they/them pronouns, was approved to take frequent breaks and get note-taking assistance, but not without some side-eye. "
worklife,"Disclosing one’s disability, especially a mental illness, is tricky for all of these reasons and can jeopardize a doctor’s ability to practice medicine. "
worklife,"Wheeler, who is also trans, said they regularly experience “decision fatigue” around when and who to disclose their identities to. In the last year, their disabilities have become increasingly visible, and they started using a cane around the time rotations began."
worklife,"“You don’t expect your doctor to be anything but fit and healthy and perfect because ‘practice what you preach,’ but many illnesses are really not preventable in a lot of ways, especially mine because it’s genetic,” Wheeler said."
worklife,"“I’ve had attendings or supervisors, when they meet me, just asking me, ‘What’s wrong with you?’ instead of saying hello,” Wheeler told HuffPost. “I’ve had people telling me I’m inspiring and they’ll keep me in their prayers, and I’m just in the elevator trying to get to work. I’ve been told I’m in the wrong room.”"
worklife,The Untenable Grind Culture
worklife,These sorts of microaggressions build up over time and can create a culture in which disabled doctors feel like their qualifications as health care professionals are doubted.
worklife,"Disability is also often left out of educational curriculums. Some medical schools — even ones that claim to prioritize diversity and inclusion — fail to incorporate disability training at all in their classes, even though it’s been shown to help reduce medical bias, according to a 2018 report from the Association of American Medical Colleges and the University of California, San Francisco, School of Medicine."
worklife,"When Priscilla Morelli, who has osteogenesis imperfecta, started studying at Florida State University College of Medicine, she noticed there was very little instruction for medical students on how to interact with disabled patients. She could only recall a one-hour session in which her class invited a single disabled guest speaker to come talk about their life story."
worklife,"Several local and national groups like ADACIM have formed over the last few years to support disabled doctors and medical students. There’s also the Society for Physicians With Disabilities, which hosts monthly meetings and manages an email listserv for hundreds of disabled students and professionals to discuss topics such as interview tips, job advice and self-disclosure."
worklife,"“It provided a very surface-level ‘people with disabilities exist, and you need to be ready for that,’” said Morelli, who will start her second year of medical school in August. “And that’s pretty much what it was.” After connecting with several students at other medical schools, she realized this wasn’t an isolated issue at her school. "
worklife,Rethinking The World Of Medicine
worklife,"Morelli is now vice president of ADACIM, the national advocacy group co-founded by Wheeler. Morelli also launched the Disability Advocacy Series at her school, hosting monthly events that teach medical students best practices on caring for disabled patients, respectful language and disability discrimination in health care, among other topics — all the material she felt should’ve been a standardized part of medical education in the first place."
worklife,"During Cejas’s neurology training program, there were several months when she was required to work a 14-hour shift for six consecutive nights."
worklife,"The lack of disability awareness in schools coupled with unrealistic expectations to be “superhuman” in clinical settings create a rat race that doctors say is untenable — for everyone. For those who finish medical school and postgraduate training, the belief is that if they managed to do it, everyone else should be expected to as well."
worklife,"“It’s almost like a contest as to who can be the fastest, most efficient, smartest superhero doctor who can jump into the room and save the day,” said Poullos, who now uses forearm crutches. “It wasn’t enough to be good. You had to be great.”"
worklife,A survey from February found that more than 80% of physicians believe significantly disabled people have a lower quality of life than those who aren’t. It’s concerning given that disabled and chronically ill people make up a large number of patients seen by doctors — increasingly so during the pandemic.
worklife,"Before Poullos became paralyzed in a biking accident in 2003, he worked similarly brutal hours. As an intern, he worked 33- to 36-hour shifts every four days."
worklife,"COVID-19 is now the third-leading cause of short-term disability in the United States, and health care workers are among those who’ve acquired disabilities through so-called long COVID. Over the last year and a half, the coronavirus has shed light on the need for more disabled doctors who have an idea of what their patients go through — less “clinicalization” of disability and more humanity. What would hospitals look like if more disabled health care workers were on the other side of the examination table? What if there was less focus on fixing people — especially those whose disabilities have no cure — and more emphasis on recovery and management of conditions and making society easier for disabled people to live in?"
worklife,"This issue doesn’t just affect doctors. When health is viewed as a measure of someone’s worth, it hurts both workers and patients."
worklife,Many patients feel like having a physician with a disability makes a big difference in the quality of their care.
worklife,"“This has affected the entire system,” Cejas said of the pandemic. “You’ve got this huge increase in the disability population [due to long COVID], and part of those people coming in with those conditions, these newly disabled people, are health care workers who got the virus. We have to start looking at what it means to have a lot of disabled physicians or a lot of physicians with mental health conditions practicing all at once and trying to practice through this.”"
worklife,"“It’s impossible to live up to that standard, whether you are disabled or not,” she said. “I’m thinking about how one of my friends in residency who got a kidney stone because she was holding her urine for too long. That’s something that happens all the time.”"
worklife,"“It’s just this ‘aha!’ moment and an extra connection that doesn’t need to be explained when you know your doctor sitting across from you says, ‘I understand,’” said Bonnie Woolston, 73, a Baltimore-based writer with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Type 4. She’s been a patient of Cheung’s for about five years and said Cheung is the first doctor out of dozens she’s seen who has symptoms similar to hers."
worklife,"“I could tell he was a little nervous and shy about his hand and how it moves, so I was like, ‘Hey, do you want to know a secret? I have the same thing. Look at me,’” Cejas said."
worklife,"Disclosing a disability and other personal details to patients isn’t generally encouraged among doctors, since it can be viewed as unprofessional, but Cejas said it can also help foster trust."
worklife,"“Because Dr. Cheung has a disability … and has difficulty walking and with stamina and balance, she understands how this affects my everyday life,” she told HuffPost."
worklife,She looked at her patient.
worklife,"“It’s a personal choice, but I think every time I’ve done it, it’s done nothing but strengthen the relationship with that patient,” she said. “For my chronic pain patients, I end up disclosing to them more than anyone else, just so I can say, ‘I’m not going to be the doctor that’s not going to believe you. I know what it feels like to be in pain and for people to act like it’s not a big deal.’”"
worklife,"About a month ago, a little boy walked into the clinic where Cejas works. As Cejas examined him, she noticed the particular way her patient moved his hand. It mirrored her own."
worklife,Cejas recalled that the boy was worried about what it would mean for him to have a disability for the rest of his life. No other doctor had told him that it was OK to be disabled or what his future could look like. Would he be happy and successful? What could he grow up to be?
worklife,"“I’m disabled, and I’m a doctor,” she told him. “Go do what you want.”"
worklife,Four-day work week trials in Iceland were deemed an “overwhelming success” by researchers in a new report. 
worklife,"The study, conducted by the Association for Sustainable Democracy in Iceland and the U.K.-based think tank Autonomy, studied 2,500 workers — about 1% of Iceland’s working population — in two major trials between 2015 and 2019. The trials “not only aimed to improve work-life balance but also to maintain or increase productivity,” noted the report."
worklife,"“Worker wellbeing dramatically increased across a range of indicators, from perceived stress and burnout to health and work-life balance,” the report released Sunday stated. At the same time, “productivity and service provision remained the same or improved across the majority of trial workplaces.”"
worklife,"“Trials have shown that shortening working hours can have a powerful positive effect,” the report concluded."
worklife,"The trials included a variety of workplaces, from traditional offices to preschools and hospitals, in 9-to-5 jobs as well as in nontraditional shifts. They were launched by the Reykjavík City Council and the Icelandic national government in response to shorter work week campaigns by unions and social organizations."
worklife,The report also noted that 86% of Iceland’s workers were now either working fewer hours or “gaining the right to shorten their hours.”
worklife,There was no cut in pay for the reduced weeks of 35 to 36 hours a week.
worklife,"Alicia Lara works the drive-thru at a Jack In The Box in Sacramento. The 55-year-old mother of four says the air conditioning unit inside the restaurant tends to conk out when she needs it most, including during a recent mid-June heat wave."
worklife,"According to Lara, the unit was not working on June 18 when the outside temperature soared well above 100 degrees. The open window at the drive-thru brought little relief, and she feared for the safety of her co-worker laboring over the grill."
worklife,Read the entire report here.
worklife,"The study could function as a blueprint for future trials in other countries, the researchers noted."
worklife,"“Most of the heat is in the kitchen and at the fryers,” she told HuffPost. “Even if we open the window, it’s still too hot.”"
worklife,"But Lara said the air conditioning unit had been repaired in the past, only to break down again during high heat."
worklife,"“We take the health and safety of our employees and guests very seriously. We have spoken to the franchise operator and confirmed that the AC is fully functioning,” a spokesperson said in an email."
worklife,"Lara was one of several workers affiliated with the Fight for $15 who protested outside the restaurant on Tuesday, saying they were walking off the job because the air conditioner still wasn’t working properly. They also filed complaints with the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health and Sacramento County Public Health, alleging their employer was endangering them during high heat. "
worklife,"“The weak A/C and water is not enough to protect the workers from the hottest day in Oregon history,” the group said. “In solidarity with each other the workers left together at 1:00 PM today.”"
worklife,"The demonstration outside Jack In The Box is unlikely to be the last time this summer that workers protest having to clock in under high heat. The calendar hasn’t yet reached July, and already, the Pacific Northwest has shattered heat records and much of the Northeast is baking under a triple-digit heat index. "
worklife,HuffPost readers: Have you had problems with excessive heat at your workplace? We’d like to hear from you. Email us.
worklife,"“They fix it but they don’t fix it right,” she said of the restaurant’s management. “What I think they don’t want is to pay the money.” "
worklife,"With climate change making heat waves harsher and more common, the sizzling temperatures will affect workers of all kinds ― not just roofers and farmworkers stuck outside, but warehouse pickers, restaurant workers and others laboring indoors, especially in workplaces not outfitted to deal with extreme heat."
worklife,"Workers at a Voodoo Doughnuts store in Portland, Oregon, staged a walkout Sunday over what they described as excessively hot working conditions. The union Doughnut Workers United, which narrowly lost a union election at the store earlier this year, wrote on Facebook that doughnuts were melting and the frosting couldn’t dry inside the store due to high temperatures."
worklife,The union said three workers who participated in the walkout were ultimately fired.
worklife,Jack In The Box told HuffPost in a statement that the restaurant is operated by a franchisee who said the air conditioning unit is up and running.
worklife,"In mid-June, workers at a Houston-area Hooters held a walkout of their own over hot temperatures. Corinne Hill, one of the dozen or so workers, told local news station KPRC that they went a month without functioning air conditioning at the restaurant, forcing them to retreat to the ice cooler to get cool air. Workers said they’d been told that the part needed to repair the unit was out of stock."
worklife,"“Employee and customer safety is our highest priority,” the spokesperson wrote. “[I]f we felt either were at risk during this time, we would have adjusted operating hours and otherwise made sure everyone was safe.”"
worklife,Voodoo Doughnuts disputed the workers’ characterization of the store as being too hot. A company spokesperson said they kept the store air-conditioned and shifted production times to avoid the most sweltering hours. 
worklife,"“Today we decided as a group we weren’t going to tolerate it,” Hill said at the time. “We demand A/C, so we walked out.”"
worklife,"Workers staging a walkout due to heat could also try to lean on the National Labor Relations Act, which guarantees the right to engage in protected concerted activity ― i.e., banding together with co-workers to improve working conditions, with or without a union. If workers were retaliated against, they could argue they were trying to protect one another’s health."
worklife,"The Occupational Safety and Health Administration can fine workplaces for heat hazards, but there is no federal standard that clearly lays out an employer’s obligations to protect workers in excessive heat. "
worklife,"Workers do have nominal rights when they object to working in excessively hot conditions, though the law won’t necessarily prevent a worker from losing their job. The Occupational Safety and Health Act grants workers the right to refuse dangerous work if there’s a clear risk of death or serious physical harm, but a worker who gets fired for it would have to win a retaliation case under OSHA. "
worklife,"The restaurant closed the dining room shortly after the walkout, and KPRC reported that an air-conditioning repair company was soon on-site."
worklife,"When OSHA cites an employer in such cases, it typically relies on the general duty clause, a catch-all rule that says employers have an obligation to provide a workplace free from hazards. Many workplace safety advocates have been pressing OSHA to adopt a federal standard similar to the state requirements that have been adopted in California."
worklife,"“I think it’s exactly what the act is designed to help workers do, which is join together to make sure they’re treated fairly,” said Celine McNicholas, labor counsel at the Economic Policy Institute."
worklife,"But the law offers weak remedies for workers who’ve been illegally punished, and McNicholas cautioned that the success of any legal argument would depend a lot on the circumstances, including how workers framed their walkout."
worklife,"The workers alleged in their complaint that the air conditioning unit was broken the entire week of June 14 to June 20, leading some workers to suffer headaches. They also claimed their manager has grown combative when they raise their concerns about the heat, accusing them of exaggerating and saying “we are just hot because of menopause.”"
worklife,"The six Jack In The Box workers who filed the heat complaint with California did so with the help of the Fight for $15, the union-backed campaign aimed at improving pay and working conditions in fast food. They asked that safety inspectors visit the restaurant and issue a citation if they find hazards. California is one of 22 states where workplace complaints are handled by a state agency rather than federal OSHA. "
worklife,"“The extended forecast for Sacramento is another heat wave,” they wrote."
worklife,They said they aren’t looking forward to July.
worklife,"The resident of Washington, D.C., whom Inside Edition identified only as “Jackie,” said she wore the shirt to 264 remote meetings between April 2, 2020, and June 16, 2021."
worklife,"A woman attempted to prank her former co-workers by wearing the same Hawaiian shirt to hundreds of Zoom meetings, but the joke ended up being on her."
worklife,"“I was like, wouldn’t it be funny if I wore this shirt again? Like that’d be a funny joke and everyone would say something,” she told the show."
worklife,The reaction was ... not what she expected.
worklife,"“When I told my team that I had been wearing the same shirt, they didn’t know what I was talking about. They hadn’t noticed,” she told the Daily Mail. “The intern literally said, ‘On purpose?’ So, there’s that,” Jackie said."
worklife,"Based on a recent TikTok post, Jackie seems more surprised that people are noticing now."
worklife,"“I had some real ups and downs. Like the first month, I was like, this is really funny. Then it’d be like, oh, I’m still wearing this. And then it’d be funny again,” she said."
worklife,"Sadly, no one said anything. "
worklife,Jackie finally spilled the beans about her shirt on her last day of work.
worklife,"“And then I thought, well, I’m going to keep doing this until someone notices, and no one ever noticed,” she said."
worklife,"Keeping the gag going despite the lack of reaction wasn’t easy, Jackie said."
worklife,"However, she told Inside Edition she has yet to wear the shirt to her new job."
relationships,"Then, he looked up and crinkled his nose, confused. “Wait, but you don’t drink. So ... no.”"
relationships,"We chatted for three hours over coffee on a foggy San Francisco morning. His bright eyes flickered as he told me about his recent hiking trip through New Zealand. I related, shared my own New Zealand travel stories, and fought the urge to imagine us rolling around in a large hammock off the shores of Papua New Guinea. I believed we would definitely see each other again and felt grateful to have met someone so easygoing. "
relationships,"On our way out of the café, he asked whether or not I liked sushi. Believing this was a segue into a future dinner invite, I enthusiastically told him I loved raw fish. "
relationships,"“You asked about sushi, right?”"
relationships,"“Yeah, but you don’t drink.”"
relationships,"This was the Jekyll-and-Hyde insanity drinking produced. I couldn’t ever stay on the same page with myself. So, after suffering for 20 years together, I finally acknowledged the worst relationship in my life and quit the drink. "
relationships,"Sushi did used to be synonymous with drinking for me, and I gathered that’s where this guy’s brain took him as well. The whole thing sounds a little ridiculous, but I do understand where a heavy drinker could get it all mixed up in their head. "
relationships,"The guy changed the subject after that, hugged me, and never spoke to me again. It appeared he ultimately could not make sense of dating someone who doesn’t drink."
relationships,"“Does one need to drink to eat sushi?” I watched our sweet date deflate like a hot air balloon, with me in it. I also recalled many a sushi night where sake bombs and the “large” Asahi beer overshadowed the beautifully colored dragon rolls laid out on the table in front of me. "
relationships,"I get it and I’ve been there. Before I stopped drinking almost seven years ago, I would have never wanted to date a sober person because I knew we could not share in the hobby I loved most. Plus, if I didn’t have alcohol to help me with my insecurity, I would have never been able to get through the first few dates, first sex, or god forbid, intimacy. There was no way, or so I thought, that I could do any of that on my own. "
relationships," Scenarios like this are not uncommon for non-drinkers dating in a world where booze remains a key player in socializing, and especially the awkward beginnings of a relationship."
relationships,"Alcohol used to swaddle me in a superhero cape. It gave me a confidence so fierce, I sometimes believed I could win the affections of any guy I approached. On the flip side, my drinking chutzpah often transitioned into debilitating anxiety and a belief that I was actually the ugliest and least interesting person in the room. "
relationships,"Of course, the first several dates out felt a little like standing on stage naked and being forced to do hot yoga poses. It took me several tries to learn how to get out of my nervous brain and into my body."
relationships,"At 36, I had never gone on a first date without drinking two to infinity glasses of wine. I learned to socialize and flirt at parties in junior high with a beer in my hand. I had zero frame of reference into 1) How to “be myself.” Who’s that? 2) How to get out of my head. 3) How to get through a whole date. "
relationships,"Over six years of practice later, I have found I best match with someone who drinks very little (yes, they do exist), or someone who doesn’t partake at all. Some people will say they don’t care about drinking and then proceed to get drunk in front of you on a first date, because it’s hard to hide it when booze is your best friend."
relationships,"I’ll never forget my date with the hot painter. His brown, shoulder-length hair rested on a see-through white linen shirt that opened a little too much around his chest. He looked like he belonged on the cover of a romance novel and, weirdly, I liked that. We met and chatted at the bar of a restaurant that was just dark enough to make out quietly in a shadowy nook if you wanted to."
relationships,"My date drank a glass of red wine as I sipped a goblet of sparkling water. Pretty straight out of the gate, he told me a story about his alcoholic father whom he had to carry out of the house to the hospital. The father died shortly after. The narrative continued and my date’s glass morphed into two and then four. "
relationships,"Living without booze forced me to find the self that countless dirty martinis had drowned and buried. Over time, I started to gain confidence in my skin by bringing the same, consistent person to the table ― in life and on dates. "
relationships,"After the story about his dad, he segued into funnier anecdotes that included hand gestures and some impersonations. I watched his personality get bigger with each glass (been there). He made me laugh and then he fell off his very tall stool (been there too). I gasped, but he popped right back up and into another lively impression. I enjoyed the show, but knew long before he fell that we weren’t a match. "
relationships,"I’ve had numerous dates after that one, sober kisses and yes, sex, and I didn’t die. Over time, I learned how to be present on dates. What that gives me is an opportunity to listen to the other person. "
relationships,"When I do this, I can hear if he is talking at me or with me. I notice if he is asking questions or going on about the fact that he could have made state as an incredible athlete in high school. It is so much easier to measure compatibility now that I have stopped thinking about what my date thinks of me, and started focusing on whether or not I want to spend more time with them. "
relationships,"Fabio and I started out on earth, together, and then I watched him board a rocket ship to several other planets, without me. That is how I feel on a date with someone on the way to drunk. Our connection decreases with every sip. "
relationships,"Although I’ve gained confidence (not drinking to excess and then not doing and saying regrettable things will do that), I do sometimes feel like an outsider. With some people, I can talk about my decision to stop with ease because they are listening and think it’s cool. Others are confused or just act like what I’m saying isn’t real. "
relationships,"I still haven’t found my forever person, but I finally believe I deserve to. "
relationships,"This process has been a long one for me, with misfires and dating situations I should have quashed sooner. But I try to go easy on myself. I started drinking as a teenager, so emotionally mature dating has taken a while to learn."
relationships,I also had to get comfortable with telling my story before I could enjoy meeting new people. I spent so much time worrying what people thought that I had trouble paying attention in the beginning. But letting go of the shame I carried around my drinking allowed me to experience unconditional love and connect with others in ways I didn’t know possible. 
relationships,"Less than a year ago, I could scarcely remember what going on a first date felt like. It had been over a decade since I’d been on one. But I was about to find out. My husband and I had separated after eight years of marriage, which meant that suddenly, for the first time in my life as a parent, I had two free nights a week to do as I pleased."
relationships," At first, I didn’t know what to do with myself. I’d sit around, maybe go for a run, probably cry, then microwave a frozen burrito for dinner and spend the night watching Netflix. The sad burrito routine got old pretty quick, though. I started going out with friends and having fun instead. Before I knew it, I felt ready to put myself out there — out into whatever the modern dating world looked like for single moms. "
relationships," But being wrapped up in a new love wasn’t all fun like I imagined it would be, or how it had felt in a past life. Because, as a mother and an ex-wife, I felt like I was constantly bearing the weight of everyone else’s emotions while trying to manage my own. From whatever my kids were struggling with to how difficult it was for my ex-husband to know that I was in a serious relationship, I felt constantly torn and conflicted in ways I had never really experienced. At times, it was like playing tug of war with my old and new selves, trying to figure out how to balance love and practicality. "
relationships,"Either way, before I knew it I was in deep. And even though I never would’ve imagined falling so hard, so fast, it had undeniably happened. I thought I’d be far less impulsive than I once was, 10 or 15 years ago. Now, here I was, a separated mother of two, acting like a teenager (and feeling like one!) when it came to being lost in my affection for someone new. I couldn’t slow it down, or maybe I just didn’t want to. Maybe that’s what happens when you’ve spent so long feeling more or less alone. When connection comes, operating from your head instead of your heart becomes a near impossible feat. I’d been in the safe cocoon of my marriage for so long, I didn’t even pause to think about the fact that I might get hurt. "
relationships,"All I knew was that it would involve apps and set-ups and divorced men. And that I might want to buy a new razor. Aside from that, I was clueless. I didn’t waste a lot of time imagining. For the first time in a long time, I felt ballsy. Intrigued. Excited. I wanted to embrace this new freedom. In fact, the freedom aspect felt like the only perk of going through a difficult separation. Truthfully, it was a pretty big perk. I’d felt lonely for most of my marriage. Though I still care about my ex-husband as a friend and co-parent, we weren’t a good match for the long haul. But I’d felt starved for love, sex, romance and maybe even a compatible partner. So, even though I didn’t know what I was looking for, I went looking anyway. "
relationships,"I got hurt. That is not an accurate way to describe how I truly felt in the aftermath of my first post-marriage breakup. Even “pummeled, blown apart, gutted” fall short. Because the truth is, when we hit a hard place and ultimately broke up, I was beyond devastated. I cried so hard behind the closed door of my bedroom each time my kids went to sleep that I had to drag myself out of bed early and hold an ice-pack to my face each morning. Nothing about this loss felt familiar. And the shock of it all was very real, mostly because I thought I had been so prepared. I’d left my marriage and felt grounded and healthy after doing so, and that made me believe that I’d be ready for anything. "
relationships,"I got on Bumble and told friends to set me up. “I think my mortgage lender just got divorced?” My bestie was grasping at straws. I was only 33 at the time. I’d been the first one to get married and likewise the first one to call it quits. I found that I had to make dating a priority if I wanted to meet people, so that’s what I did. After all, I wanted to make connections and have new experiences. I said yes to blind dates, to set-ups and went to town swiping. When I started going on first dates, I was surprised by how quickly I became interested in some of the men I met. It was likely because I was at a point in my life where I was open to whatever kind of chemistry might come my way. It was chemistry I didn’t know if I would find at all, but there it was. "
relationships,"I met a man I had an instant connection with. We had passion, and that felt like life being breathed back into my fireless soul. Without giving thought to how quickly it all had happened, I fell crazy in love. Practically as soon as we met, we started spending all our spare time together. It was like being lit up and finally being able to rest all at the same time. I was joyful and comforted and genuinely happy ― I couldn’t remember the last time I felt those things."
relationships,"Post-marriage me was supposed to have known better. I wasn’t supposed to have let this happen. I was the mother to two children who needed me and, though I found ways to get through the days, I was guilt-ridden at being this weaker version of myself. I’d been through so many things since the last time I’d been out in the world dating. And I told myself that because of it, I should’ve been better, smarter, stronger."
relationships,"I didn’t know how to feel grounded again. I didn’t even know where to plant my feet. I’d gone right from my marriage to a few months of casual dating to the person I thought was my next great love. I had had this amazing support system ― this person that I told everything to. Suddenly, while I hadn’t really known what I’d been missing for so long until it swooped into my life, now all I could do was miss it. Because it had made even the hard things feel easy. I hadn’t even remembered what it was like to feel so connected to someone. In a way, post-marriage love was almost like falling in love for the first time. Hard, fast and nearly impossible to let go of. "
relationships,"On my off-duty nights, when my kids were with their dad, I stayed on my couch. I didn’t know if I was healing or just feeling sorry for myself. But either way, I needed time to get to know who I was in the walk of life and what I needed from another person. I needed time alone, and I certainly took it. But when it came to dating, I realized I would likely need more trial and error. More love and loss. And all of that meant eventually making myself vulnerable again. I didn’t know if I had it in me. My post-marriage dating experience had been amazing at first, yes. But then it had been brutal. The irony is that I couldn’t have fallen in love without my vulnerability, but my vulnerability was the thing that left me shattered. Somehow, I had found that bravery once, though. Deep down, I knew it was still there. After a few months of grieving that first heartbreak, I decided to get brave again."
relationships,"Never did I imagine that less than a year after my separation, I’d be struggling to heal from the worst heartbreak of my life. I’d been blindsided. I’d moved too quickly, fallen too hard and completely forgotten how to bounce back. "
relationships,"It would’ve been easy to settle back into my sad-burrito and Netflix routine for good. But I wasn’t ready to resign myself to that completely. The truth was, I was still hopeful. On my first few dates back, I started to take notice of little things about myself. I noticed what made dates comfortable or uncomfortable. I saw my habits and ingrained patterns more clearly. This time, I didn’t just feel like I was meeting someone new and getting to know them. I also felt like I was becoming an expert on myself, on learning who I was now and what that meant for me in terms of building new relationships, too. That felt like a huge awakening ― that dating could be about more than just meeting someone I liked, or could even love, but also about learning so much about myself. "

relationships,"In the end, I realized that dating, post-marriage, could be more amazing than I hoped and more painful than I imagined. And that it doesn’t always get magically better with age, like you might expect. It takes work, it takes knowing yourself, it takes patience and readiness, and maybe a few earth-shattering breakups. The funny thing is that, even after the most jarring heartbreak of my life, I didn’t want to give up. Maybe that resilience is the blessing that comes with dating after a marriage, with loving and losing. Because I have been utterly broken, yet I am still so full of hope at what might be out there for me. Now I know that after you crumble, it’s a perfect time to rebuild yourself ― better, stronger, smarter, after all. I am all three, and growing all the time."
relationships,"When those good connections came again, and they did come, I let them. But I also made efforts to stay planted in my own life. I kept seeing my friends and made dating just something to do on the side. I wasn’t ready to fall in love again anyway, so I intentionally kept my feet on the ground. I found that I was learning to do that slow dance of staying vulnerable without letting go of myself completely that I’d never quite learned before. None of it meant that I wouldn’t ever get hurt again. I knew I might. But the further I got from marriage and the heartbreak that followed it, the more I understood that I was already happy to stand on my own two feet. Knowing I was truly fine on my own meant that anyone who came along would be just a bonus. "
relationships,"While before I had been so hopeful, overly hopeful perhaps, now I understood why other single moms around me didn’t date at all: It was all so emotional. It wasn’t just fun and games like I thought when I first excitedly ventured out on my first dates. It required time and energy and getting your hopes up. And not only that, if you did develop a relationship, that meant you could wind up wounded ― every bit as wounded (if not more) as you were when you were young and naive because love, as they say, is blind. That doesn’t really change after a marriage. In fact, if you’re feeling things you haven’t felt in eons, it might even be truer now. And then, if things crumble, you still have to get up every day and be a parent. There just isn’t as much time to cater to yourself, to cry, to vent to friends, to mend your broken heart."
relationships,"I first saw Steve by the pool at my friend’s apartment complex on a lazy August afternoon. Fit and tan, he was hanging out with his pack of equally gorgeous friends. We officially met the following week on another sunny afternoon by the pool. I watched him dive into the water and as he emerged, he flashed a huge smile and I was overcome by how handsome he was."
relationships,"I knew I had to talk to him and, despite how nervous I was, I managed to muster up the courage to walk over to him and offer him a beer. He gladly accepted and we introduced ourselves. That was 15 years ago, and we’ve spent every single day since then together."
relationships,"During the days that directly followed our chance meeting, our lives seemed a lot like a dating montage in a romantic comedy. We talked and laughed for hours. We walked our neighborhood holding hands. We rode the Hollywood and Mulholland hills on his Vespa. We saw a burlesque show at the House of Blues and went on a Hollywood Forever Cemetery tour. And we went to a ton of social gatherings and dinners with my friends and his friends — and they all said they thought we were a perfect match. We couldn’t get enough of one another. We were literally inseparable; it was as if we were trying to catch up on all the time we had spent apart before that fateful Sunday afternoon."
relationships,"When we told our best friends, they were amused and fairly nonchalant about it, which maybe isn’t all that surprising considering we lived in Hollywood and spur-of-the-moment engagements aren’t exactly rare even now (Hello, Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson). But, we weren’t movie stars or models — I was a twenty-something aspiring musician and writer and he was mostly a writer, and we easily could have been perceived as delusional for deciding to get engaged so quickly."
relationships,"Needless to say, we fell in love almost immediately. After a string of failed relationships and crazy dates with men that were either codependent or emotionally unavailable, I had finally found my soulmate — someone who was fun, loving, attentive and romantic. With Steve, everything was new and exciting, but also incredibly — and strangely — comfortable. So, when he proposed to me just 10 days after we met, I wasn’t completely shocked — it actually made sense."
relationships,"However, because we were clearly made for each other — and because we were so obviously in love — no one thought we were crazy. Our family and friends were genuinely happy for us and they gave us their blessings to move forward with our plan to spend our lives together."
relationships,"I wore a white lace gown with embroidered flowers and pearls, which I found at a vintage store in Studio City a couple of weeks before the wedding. It fit me so well, it was like it had been custom-made for me and, miraculously, it had never been worn before. Steve looked as handsome as ever in a sharp gray suit and wore dark sunglasses most of the day. I could tell he was a little nervous, but I didn’t read too much into it — I was nervous, too. I thought it was cute because we were just as anxious as any other normal couple on their big day, and that assured me that we had made the right choice."
relationships,"We had been watching ”Casablanca” at my apartment when Steve suddenly got down on one knee and presented me with a plastic ring. He hadn’t had time to get a real engagement ring, but I couldn’t have cared less. Steve was my diamond, and I said “Yes!” without hesitation. I was in love and didn’t think twice about giving any other answer. We were constantly asking each other “Where have you been all my life?” and we didn’t want to waste any more time."
relationships,"So, with no one trying to foil our wedding plans, we charged ahead. We decided to tie the knot in Las Vegas because we had coincidentally won a free two-night stay at the Hard Rock Hotel during a celebrity poker tournament. We booked the Chapel of the Bells, and two months later, on Halloween, we were married in a ceremony officiated by an Elvis impersonator in front of our closest friends."
relationships,"We certainly thought we did. As cliché as it might sound, it really felt like we were under some kind of spell — our minds were foggy and our hearts ruled over reason, but that’s what being in love is all about, isn’t it?"
relationships,"Looking back, Vegas was an absolutely perfect setting for our wedding. Where else but the gambling capital of the world to make our union official? After all, we were betting big on our future. Our marriage could have continued as sweetly as our courtship had, or it could have ended up miserably. Sure, we had spent pretty much every day together up until that moment, but was that enough? Could we confidently say that we knew each other on the incredibly deep level it takes to combine two separate lives into one?"
relationships,"Getting married so quickly definitely came with its fair share of risks. For instance, who knew how many things Steve might have been consciously or unconsciously hiding from me? But I honestly didn’t care. I believed in love at first sight and I trusted my gut. The only time I remember feeling even the slightest sensation of doubt was in our limo right after the ceremony. We were on our way to celebrate at a nearby Mexican restaurant and I was staring at our intertwined fingers and our shiny new wedding bands when, for a few seconds, voices, music, traffic noises and everything else around me seemed to float away. What if it doesn’t work? I wondered, but that worry disappeared as quickly as it had appeared."
relationships,"In many ways, I value friendship as much as romantic love, so I’ve always made a point of nurturing my friends and making new ones even after being married. Finding the time to see them, go to dinner and a show with them, or travel with them has never been an issue because there’s always been mutual trust and respect between Steve and me."
relationships,"Of course, even though it might sound like we’re two characters out of a fairytale, that doesn’t mean that we’re perfect. Steve has some habits that drive me nuts (he smokes too much, just to mention one), and I know that he dislikes some of mine, too (my obsession with cleaning, for instance), but that’s fine. It’d be weird if we didn’t. I’ve learned that loving someone is about accepting them unconditionally and working on your differences with an open heart and open communication. We’ve discovered that talking about our feelings and emotions is vital to being understood and keeping our relationship healthy, and it’s worked for us."
relationships,"Still, being married and living with someone was a totally new experience — not only because I had never lived with a partner before, but also because I had never achieved the level of intimacy that I felt with Steve. Even my previous longest relationship with my former Italian fiance (I found out he’d cheated on me shortly after we got engaged and I dumped him) didn’t come close to comparing to what I felt in the early days of my marriage."
relationships,"As months passed, our bond and love grew stronger and so did our commitment to our future together. We soon began making plans to buy a house, and a year and a half later, we were the proud owners of a Spanish-style bungalow. Throughout the years, we made other investments, and in 2016, 13 years into our marriage, we welcomed our son, Theodore."
relationships,"Our old friends call us the poster couple for true romance, and when we meet new people and they hear our story, they often look at us like we’re aliens. They usually ask us the same things: “How did you make it happen?” and “How are you still together?”"
relationships,"Those are fair questions, and we’re the first to admit that we don’t know how it happened or exactly how we’ve managed to stay together for this long. Sure, we’ve had moments when we butted heads or disagreed — just like any other couple — but we’ve honestly never experienced any major incompatibilities."
relationships,"There is no magic formula to finding love or falling in love, but there are definitely things one can do to keep a relationship strong. For Steve and me, maintaining our independence within our marriage — including cultivating separate interests and friendships — has been key. For instance, I practice yoga and chant, and volunteer whenever I can, while Steve loves making and editing videos. By nature, we’re both free spirits, so having our own time and space helped us focus on ourselves and not lose our identities as individuals and artists. By committing ourselves to keeping our personal hobbies, passions and friendships, we have kept our relationship thriving."
relationships,"The other question we get is, “Would you recommend getting married so soon after meeting?” It obviously was the right move for us but I can’t guarantee it would work for anyone else. Tying the knot semi-impulsively is exciting, but it’s important to have realistic expectations, and you must be honest with one another to make it last. Waiting longer can certainly help to discover potential pitfalls, but if a couple is incompatible, even waiting for 30 years won’t save a relationship that is most likely destined to fail. Steve and I believe that if we waited, we still would have got hitched a year or two after meeting because we get along so well. "
relationships,"I should also note that we didn’t really have anything major to lose by getting married so quickly. We were young, wild, passionate and fearless. In a way, that made our choice easier. But those aren’t necessarily the ingredients for building a lasting romance, and I’d suggest that other couples take stock of where they are, what they want, and what the consequences of getting married could be — especially if they are at a different place in their lives. For example, I imagine that two divorcees with kids might want to think twice before getting engaged 10 days after meeting. "
relationships,"Every situation is different; every couple is different — but it’s always best to be cautious when it comes to your heart, your finances and your future when you’ve just met someone. Steve and I were extremely lucky in that regard. We gambled, and so far, our winning streak is still going strong."
relationships,Arianna Menon is a writer and editor living in Los Angeles. 
relationships,"When we arrived home from Vegas, we started our new life as husband and wife — which really wasn’t much different than the one we shared in the weeks leading up to our wedding day. I had moved into Steve’s apartment the month before, so we already knew each other’s routines, tastes and dislikes. We often compared being married to having a soft pillow to hug — it was like a comfortable and tender support system on hand whenever we needed it."

Those documents show that Trump — despite having tried to overthrow American democracy after losing his election by 7 million votes — was able to raise $42.9 million for the MAGA Pac and his Save America “leadership” committee in the first six months of 2021.
world news,"The new FEC disclosures show that Trump has control over $112.6 million, with about $105 million available through Save America.

world news,"Giffords, whose husband Mark Kelly now serves as a U.S. senator representing Arizona, would later resign from Congress and start an eponymous organization dedicated to combating gun violence. She recently spoke with HuffPost via email about how she now sees bipartisan moments like this as few and far between."

world news,"Public service has always motivated me. I had to return for that vote on the House floor 10 years ago because I didn’t want to let my colleagues and my constituents down. Today, the public service I’m engaged in takes a different form ― I may no longer be in elected office, but my desire to serve is as strong as ever. I founded my organization, Giffords, after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in December 2012. Since then, I’ve fought to make progress both in my own recovery and in the fight against our country’s gun violence epidemic."
world news,"On Jan. 6, you wrote to Mark on Twitter and said that you “couldn’t stop thinking about what you must have gone through 10 years ago this week.” Could you elaborate on that?"
world news,"After I was shot, so many things that I had taken for granted before ― like speaking and walking ― were suddenly incredibly hard. Today, many of these things are still difficult, but thanks to my care team and people like my speech therapist, Fabi, I’ve made so much progress. And thanks to the incredible people who work at Giffords and across the gun safety movement, we’re making progress in this fight, too, even if the path isn’t always as smooth as we’d like it to be. "
world news,"After I was shot, I could only say “chicken” and “what” over and over. I knew that I needed to expand my ability to actually convey the thoughts in my head. Doing so was a painstaking, deliberate process. But I was determined, and I remain determined to this day. Preparing for the speech I gave at the Democratic National Convention last summer took weeks. But my struggles to relearn how to speak have given me a newfound appreciation for raising my voice to make a difference. It’s clearer to me than ever before that words are precious, and they can have great power. "
world news,"This is one of the many reasons I’m thrilled that my friend Joe Biden is in the White House. President Biden is a fundamentally kind, empathetic person who has suffered tremendously and come out the other side stronger. I can’t imagine where we’d be without his leadership and the leadership of Vice President [Kamala] Harris in this moment. "
world news,"I was scared. Scared for my husband, Mark, and all of his colleagues, and scared to see the country I love under attack by its own people. When I talk about how words matter, that applies in this context, too. Divisive, inflammatory rhetoric brings us further from the ideal that this nation aspires to. It puts people’s lives at risk, and as we saw on January 6th, can jeopardize our democracy itself. "
world news,"When I was shot 10 years ago, some outlets initially reported that I hadn’t survived. Tragically, six people didn’t, including 9-year-old Christina-Taylor Green. On January 6th, I feared for Mark’s safety while awaiting news of his whereabouts. It’s the same fear too many Americans feel after hearing of a shooting at a place where their loved one was ― it’s not something I would wish upon anyone. "

world news,What are your hopes for gun policy during the current Congress? Can universal background checks ― or any other legislation focused on preventing gun violence ― pass the Senate without reforms to the filibuster?
world news,Is there anything more the Biden administration could be doing to combat gun violence?
world news,"I’ve known Joe Biden a long time. When I returned to the House floor 10 years ago, he made a point to come see me. I’ve talked about how glad I am that he and Vice President Harris are in the White House, and that absolutely applies to gun violence prevention. When I joined President Biden in the Rose Garden in April, he announced a series of critical actions on gun safety, including nominating a strong [Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives] director and funding lifesaving community violence intervention programs."
world news,"I remain hopeful, because the people are on our side. Policies like universal background checks, which has the support of 90% of Americans, actually unify Americans in an unprecedented fashion. Yet too many politicians remain beholden to the gun lobby, choosing to do what’s easy rather than what’s right. "
world news,"Gun violence spiked during the pandemic and has continued to rise in some places this year, with relatively little public outcry compared to what greeted mass shootings in the past. Do you worry the public has become numb to the issue? "
world news,"At Giffords, we’re doing our part to change that, but I want to urge anyone who cares about gun safety ― anyone who has ever worried that they’ll be caught at a baseball game during an active shooter situation, or feared that their children won’t make it back from school one day ― to make their voices heard on this issue. Otherwise, the other side wins, and the violence continues. "
world news,How does your life today compare to where you thought you would be now 10 years ago?
world news,"Unfortunately, I do think our politics have become even more divided than they were when I was in Congress ― yet I also don’t think these divisions are inevitable. The American people want elected leaders to do the governing they were elected to do, not politicians locked in an endless stalemate. We must continue to raise our voices and demand change on the issues that are most important to us. We must continue voting and ensuring that our democratic process remains accessible to all. And above all, we must never lose hope. "
world news,"More recently, his administration announced additional reforms aimed at preventing firearm trafficking and using intervention strategies to stem deadly cycles of gun violence. When it comes to an epidemic that claims 40,000 American lives a year, there is always more to be done, but I couldn’t be more grateful to have the Biden administration as a thoughtful and eager partner in this fight. "
world news,"People have certainly had a lot on their minds throughout the pandemic ― from concern for their own health and well-being and that of their families, to economic uncertainty and rising unemployment, to the long-overdue protests for racial justice that dominated headlines last summer. Yet gun violence has not gone away, as you noted ― in fact, it’s gotten worse. "

world news,The International Olympic Committee has closed a potential disciplinary case against two Chinese gold medalists who wore pin badges of Mao Zedong on the Olympic podium.
world news,"“Her actions were deemed to be in violation of the UIPM Competition Rules, which are applied to all recognized Modern Pentathlon competitions including the Olympic Games,” the statement added."
world news,"In a statement released online Saturday, the International Modern Pentathlon Union said it had “given a black card” to Raisner “disqualifying her from the remainder” of the Tokyo Games."
world news,"Its executive board had “reviewed video footage that showed” Raisner “appearing to strike” the horse “with her fist,” it continued."
world news,"Schleu, who finished fourth at the Rio Games in 2016, had been leading the field before the equestrian round. She was eliminated from the showjumping element and finished the entire event in 18th place."
world news,"“They said we had no chance. They said the patrones were just too powerful. They said change was impossible here,” Cisneros says as images of the district’s neighborhoods and workers appear on screen. “But we showed them that the dreams of immigrants, truckers, rancheros and teachers can be just as powerful as their corporate dollars.”"
world news,"“A lot of people were left with so much hope last election cycle,” she added. “We were asking folks to envision the impossible and we were so close that we could taste that victory. I wanted to honor all the hard work that everyone put into this election.”"
world news,"“The last election showed that people are ready for new leadership and we’re ready to finish the job that we started,” Cisneros told HuffPost."
world news,"Jessica Cisneros, a progressive immigration attorney who narrowly lost a 2020 primary election challenge against Democratic Texas Rep. Henry Cuellar, announced Thursday that she’ll try again."
world news,But she used a two-minute announcement video to advertise her ties to working-class people in South Texas.
world news,"Cisneros, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, briefly practiced law in New York City before moving home to Laredo in 2019 to run against Cuellar in Texas’ 28th Congressional District. "
world news,The camera then shows her atop a horse alongside her cowboy hat-clad father.
world news,"Cisneros, a proponent of Medicare for All and the Green New Deal, champions causes that excite the national progressive movement."
world news,Cisneros argues that Cuellar has failed to address the social and economic challenges heightened by the COVID-19 pandemic.
world news,"“Now we’re back to finish what we started ― to do what my dad taught me: Work hard, keep at it, y enseñar que la esperanza nunca muere,” she says, using the Spanish words for “and teach that hope never dies.”"
world news,"Cisneros notes that Cuellar was the only Democrat to vote against the PRO Act, a bill strengthening union rights; that he co-sponsored legislation that would increase detention of undocumented immigrants; and that he facilitated the acquisition of $500,000 worth of COVID-19 tests that Laredo officials said were unreliable."
world news,"In her March 2020 run against Cuellar, one of the House’s most conservative Democrats, Cisneros surprised poll watchers with a strong showing against the veteran incumbent, losing by less than 4 percentage points. "
world news,But Cisneros maintains that her campaign is “very reflective of the people in this district.”
world news,"As the COVID-19 pandemic set in, Cisneros stayed in the district to work as an immigration attorney along the Texas-Mexico border. She joined Texas RioGrande Legal Aid’s Laredo office, where she represents low-income clients in need of legal representation. She has also been working as a supervising attorney at the Laredo office for RAICES, a nonprofit that represents undocumented immigrants in detention."
world news,"It is not yet clear what Cuellar’s district will look like after Republicans in the Texas Legislature redraw it. The new seat could well include a larger number of conservative voters, which would benefit him."
world news,"Cisneros is sure to encounter fierce resistance from Cuellar, as well as skepticism from establishment Democrats unnerved by strong 2020 election performances by then-President Donald Trump and other Republicans in South Texas. "
world news,"Regardless, Cuellar is likely to argue that only a conservative Democrat like him is capable of winning a general election in the changing region."
world news,"“When we expected Henry Cuellar to step up and be bold in the moment, he didn’t,” Cisneros said."
world news,"Justice Democrats suffered a setback on Tuesday, however, when former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, a progressive star backed by the group, lost a special primary election for Ohio’s 11th Congressional District. Turner’s disparaging comments about President Joe Biden and history of criticizing Democratic Party leaders played a major role in her defeat."
world news,"“Joe Biden’s values align better with our campaign’s than they do with Henry Cuellar’s, because [Cuellar is] constantly anti-labor, constantly against reproductive justice, constantly against the environment,” she said."
world news,"Cisneros is unlikely to have that problem. She not only voted for Biden, but also repurposed her campaign infrastructure to organize phone banks and canvasses on his behalf."
world news,She argues that her policy positions are closer to Biden’s than Cuellar’s.
world news,The left-wing group Justice Democrats recruited Cisneros to run in 2020 and is backing her bid again this time.
world news,"“As much as I’m ready to work with folks, I am also willing to call them out when they are not on the right side of issues for South Texans,” Cisneros said."
world news,"There are obviously issues like Medicare for All, where Cisneros is to Biden’s left ideologically. But she sees Rep. Bush’s successful pressure on Biden to extend the eviction moratorium as evidence that the president is open to adapting when pushed."
world news,"“I’m ready to work for whoever has the best interests of our community in mind,” she said. “I also recognize that we would have been much better off with a president like Joe Biden because South Texas could not afford another four years of President Trump.”"
world news,"After Cisneros’ narrow defeat, which occurred very early in the election cycle, three candidates backed by Justice Democrats went on to unseat other incumbents: Marie Newman, Jamaal Bowman, and Cori Bush."
world news,"Voters, she said, want someone who is “actually fighting to recognize that health care is a human right, make sure that everyone is covered, that we are increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour, that we are fighting for diversifying jobs here in the area, fighting for infrastructure.”"
world news,BARCELONA (AP) — Barcelona said Thursday that Lionel Messi will not stay with the club after Spanish league financial regulations made it impossible for a deal to be reached between the club and the player.
world news,Barcelona said in a statement that a deal for a new contract had been reached but financial “obstacles” made it impossible for the player to remain with the club.
world news,"“Despite club and player reaching an agreement and their clear intention to sign a new contract today, this cannot happen because of financial and structural obstacles,” the club said."

world news,"He’s Andre De Grasse, the Canadian who ran his first sprint in baggy basketball shorts and borrowed spikes, and now has an Olympic gold medal in the 200 meters."
world news,Perhaps the world’s next sprint star wasn’t so hard to find after all.
world news,"He also won a silver in the 200 there, though his stay in Brazil is best remembered for the time he had the audacity to mess with Bolt."
world news,"De Grasse powered past a pair of Americans — Kenny Bednarek and the favorite, Noah Lyles — to finish in 19.62 seconds and take one of the titles that Usain Bolt had owned for the last three Olympics."
world news,It was a semifinal race and the two were far ahead of the field and easily going to make the medal race. But De Grasse kept pushing. It forced Bolt to kick things back into overdrive.
world news,It ends a string of close calls for the 26-year-old and fills out a medal collection that was only missing a gold. De Grasse won bronze four nights earlier in the 100 to go with the third-place medal he took in Rio de Janeiro.
world news,"Italian sprinter Marcell Jacobs came from nowhere to win the 100, leaving De Grasse behind in what is usually considered his second-best distance."
world news,"Lesson learned, and since Bolt left the scene, the world has been looking for someone, anyone, to take his place in the marquee track events."
world news,"Bolt won the race but playfully wagged his finger at De Grasse. The moment went viral, and Bolt insisted he wasn’t pleased. He came back to blow away De Grasse in the final, by nearly a quarter second, but the champion suggested the extra energy didn’t help in his futile quest to re-set his world record of 19.19."
world news,"And finally, De Grasse has cashed in. It’s his first gold at a major event after amassing two silvers and six bronzes at Olympics and world championships since 2015."
world news,"At one point, he looked like he might be heading for an attempt at a 100-200 double. But his 100 at Olympic trials was a mess, and his best race of the season was the 200 final in Eugene, Oregon."
world news,"“It’s persistence,” said Canadian decathlete Damian Warner, who hung out near the track to watch his teammate win. “He’s had to go against Usain Bolt, Yohan Blake, all these tough competitors. So it’s not like he’s just choking or losing in the final. He’s losing to some really great athletes.”"
world news,"Lyles made a mistake the night before in the semifinals, slowing down too far before the line, getting edged out for the two automatic spots, and being forced to wait to see if his time would earn him a qualifying spot."
world news,"This time, he beat some — most notably, Lyles, who has been on a difficult road to the Tokyo Olympics. He has openly talked about his own mental-health issues and how the pandemic disrupted everything."
world news,"“Unfortunately, I couldn’t see anybody and was running for my life,” Lyles said. “I thought I was the one behind. I felt like I was the one chasing.”"
world news,"Nope. De Grasse was doing the chasing. And catching. And, finally, winning. He’s the first sprint gold medalist for Canada since Donovan Bailey won the 100 at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics."
world news,"It cost him in the final. Forced to start in Lane 3, where all the top competition races behind him, Lyles pushed out too quickly. He had the lead heading into the homestretch but had nothing more to give."
world news,"Olympic bronze medalist Tony Sharpe was sitting in the stands that day, saw it and said, “Who is this guy?”"
world news,"Quite an accomplishment for a one-time point guard who got into track on a whim. On the bus in high school, he bumped into a friend, who challenged him to come out to the track. De Grasse thought he could beat his buddy, so he went out in his basketball shorts, started from a standing position and finished in 10.9."
world news,"That was in 2012. Not a decade later, nobody is asking anymore."
world news,MOSCOW (AP) — A Russian space official on Friday blamed a software problem on a newly docked science lab for briefly knocking the International Space Station out of position.
world news,"Vladimir Solovyov, flight director of the space station’s Russian segment, blamed the incident on a “short-term software failure.” In a statement released Friday by the Russian space agency Roscosmos, Solovyov said because of the failure, a direct command to turn on the lab’s engines was mistakenly implemented."
world news,"“There was such euphoria (after Nauka successfully docked with the space station), people relaxed to some extent,” Rogozin said in a radio interview. “Perhaps one of the operators didn’t take into account that the control system of the block will continue to adjust itself in space. And it determined a moment three hours after (the docking) and turned on the engines.”"
world news,"The space station lost control of its orientation for 47 minutes on Thursday, when Russia’s Nauka science lab accidentally fired its thrusters a few hours after docking, pushing the orbiting complex from its normal configuration. The station’s position is key for getting power from solar panels and for communications with space support teams back on Earth. The space station’s communications with ground controllers also blipped out twice for a few minutes on Thursday."
world news,Roscosmos director Dmitry Rogozin later Friday suggested that “human factor” may have been at play.
world news,"He added the incident was “quickly countered by the propulsion system” of another Russian component at the station and “at the moment, the station is in its normal orientation” and all its systems “are operating normally.”"
world news,"Russia’s long-delayed 22-ton (20-metric-ton) lab called Nauka arrived earlier Thursday, eight days after it launched from the Russian launch facility in Baikonur, Kazakhstan."
world news,"NASA said Thursday that the incident moved the station 45 degrees out of attitude, about one-eighth of a complete circle, but the complex was never spinning, there was no immediate damage or danger to the crew."
world news,The incident caused NASA to postpone a repeat test flight for Boeing’s crew capsule that had been set for Friday afternoon from Florida. It will be Boeing’s second attempt to reach the 250-mile-high (400-kilometer-high) station before putting astronauts on board. Software problems botched the first test.
world news,"The launch of Nauka, which will provide more room for scientific experiments and space for the crew, had been repeatedly delayed because of technical problems. It was initially scheduled to go up in 2007."
world news,"Stretching 43 feet (13 meters) long, Nauka became the first new compartment for the Russian segment of the outpost since 2010. On Monday, one of the older Russian units, the Pirs spacewalking compartment, undocked from the station to free up room for the new lab."
world news,"In 2013, experts found contamination in its fuel system, resulting in a long and costly replacement. Other Nauka systems also underwent modernization or repairs."
world news,"Nauka will require many maneuvers, including up to 11 spacewalks beginning in early September, to prepare it for operation."
world news,"In 1998, Russia launched the station’s first compartment, Zarya, which was followed in 2000 by another big piece, Zvezda, and three smaller modules in the following years. The last of them, Rassvet, arrived at the station in 2010."

world news,President Xi Jinping’s government imposed the law on the former British colony last year following protests that erupted in mid-2019. Beijing has rolled back the territory’s Western-style civil liberties and tried to crush a pro-democracy movement by jailing activists. The public’s role in picking Hong Kong’s legislators has been reduced.
world news,Tong’s sentence was longer than the three years requested by the prosecution. He faced a possible maximum of life in prison.
world news,Critics accuse Beijing of violating the autonomy promised when Hong Kong returned to China in 1997 and wrecking its status as a global business center. Human rights activists say the security law is being abused to attack legitimate dissent.
world news,"The law “lacks any exemption for legitimate expression or protest,” Mishra said. “The judgment at no point considered Tong’s rights to freedom of expression and protest.”"
world news,"Tong’s sentence is a “hammer blow to free speech” and shows the law is “a tool to instill terror” in government critics, Amnesty International’s Asia-Pacific regional director, Yamini Mishra, said in a statement."
world news,"The U.S. government, in a statement, criticized the “unjust outcome” of Tong’s trial and said the security law was used “as a political weapon to silence dissenting voices.” It said China is undermining rights guaranteed by Hong Kong’s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, and by the 1984 Chinese-British Joint Declaration on the territory’s return."
world news,It called on Beijing to “stop targeting individuals exercising their rights and freedoms.”

world news,"The judges convicted Tong on Tuesday, ruling his actions were aimed at intimidating the government and public. It said carrying the flag was an act of incitement to secession, rejecting defense arguments that Tong couldn’t be proven to be inciting secession just by using the slogan."
world news,"As Tong was led out of the courtroom, spectators yelled, “We will wait for you!”"
world news,"After the court adjourned, a spectator yelled to lead defense lawyer Clive Grossman, “Mr. Grossman, appeal!” Another lawyer, Lawrence Lau, said Tong expressed thanks to the Hong Kong public for their support."
world news,"Tong was sentenced to eight years for incitement to secession and 6 1/2 years for terrorism, with some time to be served concurrently for a total of nine years, said Toh, the judge."
world news,"The sentence reflects “the abhorrence of society,” the ruling said."
world news,"Tong expressed remorse but that didn’t count toward reducing his sentence because he failed to plead guilty, the judges said in a written ruling. They said he had “good character” and no criminal record but due to the “serious offenses” those would not mitigate the penalty."
world news,Tong’s trial was conducted without a jury under rules that allow an exception to Hong Kong’s British-style common law system if state secrets need to be protected or foreign forces are involved. The judges were picked by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam.

“I feel amazing because I know I’m about to inspire so many people,” Saunders told reporters, per NBC News. “I’m about to inspire so many young girls, so many young boys, so many LGBTQ people, so many people that have battled suicide.

world news,"“Shout out to all my Black people, shout out to all my LBGTQ community, shout out to everybody dealing with mental health,” Saunders said. “Because at the end of the day, we understand that it’s bigger than us, and it’s bigger than the powers that be.”"
world news,"Although the IOC has banned protests on the podiums, it has relaxed restrictions amid opposition from athletes and social justice groups, allowing medalists to make gestures on the field and during press conferences as long as they don’t disrupt any events or are offensive to competitors. Those who break the rules are subject to sanctions."
world news,"“Look at me now,” she said, “I’m poppin’.” "

world news,"PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) — The arrest of a failed Haitian businessman living in Florida who authorities say was a key player in the killing of Haiti’s president deepened the mystery Monday into an already convoluted plot surrounding the assassination."
world news,"He said the plan was for Moïse to be arrested, not killed, and Sanon would not have participated if he knew Moïse would be assassinated."
world news,"Haitian authorities identified the suspect as Christian Emmanuel Sanon, 62, who once expressed a desire to lead his country in a YouTube video. However, he is unknown in Haitian political circles, and associates suggested he was duped by those really behind the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in an attack last week that critically wounded his wife, Martine, who remains hospitalized in Miami."
world news,"Echoing those sentiments was the Rev. Larry Caldwell, a Florida pastor, who said he worked with Sanon setting up churches and medical clinics in Haiti from 2000-2010. He doesn’t believe Sanon would have been involved in violence."
world news,"“I guarantee you that,” the associate said. “This was supposed to be a mission to save Haiti from hell, with support from the U.S. government.”"
world news,"“I know the character of the man,” Caldwell said. “You take a man like that and you’re then going to say he participated in a brutal crime of murder, knowing that being associated with that would send him to the pits of hell? ... If there was one man who would be willing to stand in the breach to help his country, it would be Christian.”"
world news,"Haiti’s National Police chief, Léon Charles, said Moïse’s killers were protecting Sanon, whom he accused of working with those who plotted the assassination."
world news,"Twenty-six former Colombian soldiers are suspected in the killing and 23 have been arrested, along with three Haitians. Charles said five suspects are still at large and at least three have been killed."
world news,"Meanwhile, Colombia’s national police chief, Gen. Jorge Luis Vargas, said that a Florida-based enterprise, CTU Security, used its company credit card to buy 19 plane tickets from Bogota to Santo Domingo for the Colombian suspects. Most arrived in the Dominican Republic in June and moved into Haiti within weeks, Vargas said."
world news,"Charles said officers found a hat with the logo of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, 20 boxes of bullets, gun parts, four license plates from the Dominican Republic, two cars and correspondence, among other things, in Sanon’s house in Haiti."
world news,"He said that Dimitri Hérard, head of general security at Haiti’s National Palace, flew to Colombia, Ecuador and Panama in the months before the assassination, and Colombian police are investigating whether he had any role in recruiting the mercenaries. In Haiti, prosecutors are seeking to interrogate Hérard over the assassination."
world news,"“They are dangerous individuals,” Charles said. “I’m talking commando, specialized commando.”"
world news,"A U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration official told AP that one of the suspects in Moïse’s assassination was at times a confidential source to the agency, and that the suspect reached out to his contacts at the DEA after the killing and was urged to surrender. The official said the DEA and a U.S. State Department official provided information to Haiti’s government that led to the surrender and arrest of one suspect and one other individual, whom it didn’t identify."
world news,Charles said Sanon was in contact with CTU Security and that the company recruited the suspects in the killing. He said Sanon flew into Haiti in June on a private jet accompanied by several of the alleged gunmen.
world news,"“The operation started from there,” he said, adding that 22 additional suspects joined the group."
world news,"The suspects’ initial mission was to protect Sanon, but they later received a new order: to arrest the president, Charles said."
world news,"Charles said that after Moïse was killed, one suspect phoned Sanon, who got in touch with two people believed to be masterminds of the plot. He did not identify them or say if police know who they are."
world news,"He said Sanon asked why the security team accompanying him to Haiti were all Colombians. Sanon was told Haitians couldn’t be trusted and that the system is corrupt, the associate said. He said Sanon called him from Haiti a few days before the assassination and said the Colombians had disappeared."
world news,"Sanon’s associate said he attended a recent meeting in Florida with Sanon and about a dozen other people, including Antonio Enmanuel Intriago Valera, a Venezuelan émigré to Miami who runs CTU Security. He said a presentation was made for rebuilding the country, including its water system, converting trash into energy and fixing roads."
world news,"“I’m all by myself. Who are these people? I don’t know what they are doing,” the associate quoted Sanon as saying."
world news,"Sanon has lived in Broward County in Florida, as well as in Hillsborough County on the Gulf Coast. Records also show he resided in Kansas City, Missouri. He filed for bankruptcy in Florida in 2013 and identified himself as a medical doctor in a video on YouTube titled “Leadership for Haiti.”"
world news,"Sanon “is completely gullible,” the associate added. “He thinks God is going to save everything.”"
world news,"Sanon said in court papers filed in a 2013 bankruptcy case in Florida that he was a physician and a pastor at the Tabarre Evangelical Tabernacle in Haiti. He said he had stakes in enterprises including the Organization of Rome Haiti, which he identified as a non-governmental organization, a radio station in Haiti and medical facilities in Haiti and the Dominican Republic."
world news,"However, records show Sanon has never been licensed to practice medicine or any other occupation covered by Florida’s Department of Health."
world news,"At the time of his bankruptcy, he and his wife reported income of $5,000 per month, and a home in Brandon, Florida, valued at about $143,000, with a mortgage of more than $367,000. A federal bankruptcy trustee later determined they hid ownership of about 35 acres in Haiti from creditors."
world news,"Florida records show Sanon started about a dozen businesses over the last 20 years, all of which failed, including ones that appeared related to medical imaging, physical therapy, fossil fuel trading, real estate and veganism."
world news,"In a 2011 YouTube video, Sanon denounced Haiti’s leadership as corrupt, accusing them of stripping the country of its resources, saying: “They don’t care about the country, they don’t care about the people.”"
world news,"He falsely claimed that Haiti has uranium, oil and other resources that have been taken by government officials."
world news,"“Nine million people can’t be in poverty when we have so much resources in the country. It’s impossible,” he said. “We need new leadership that will change the way of life.”"

world news,Zuma was not in court for the ruling on Tuesday and has been ordered to hand himself over within five days to a police station in his hometown of Nkandla in KwaZulu-Natal province or in Johannesburg.

This is a central pillar of our hard-won democracy.”"
world news,"“Finally, Zuma will find himself where he belongs - behind bars,” said opposition politician Herman Mashaba in reaction to the sentence."
world news,"In a previous 21-page letter written to Chief Justice Mogoeng Mogoeng, which the court has described as “scandalous,” Zuma claimed that he was ready to be sent to prison."
world news,"Zuma has previously expressed his unwillingness to appear before the commission, which has so far heard evidence directly implicating Zuma in wrongdoing."
world news,"“Mr. Zuma has repeatedly reiterated that he would rather be imprisoned than to cooperate with the commission or comply with the order made,” said Khampepe."

When she realized some of the photographers accompanying her didn’t get the shot, she turned around and did it again."
world news,LONDON (AP) — Most people wouldn’t volunteer to walk through a minefield. Princess Diana did it twice.
world news,"“Diana was a real hugger in the royal family,” said Sally Bedell Smith, author of “Diana in Search of Herself.’’ “She was much more visibly tactile in the way she interacted with people. It was not something the queen was comfortable with and still is not.’’"
world news,"Those touched by the life of the preschool teacher turned princess remembered her ahead of what would have been her 60th birthday on Thursday, recalling the complicated royal rebel who left an enduring imprint on the House of Windsor."
world news,"Diana didn’t invent the idea of royals visiting the poor, destitute or downtrodden. Queen Elizabeth II herself visited a Nigerian leper colony in 1956. But Diana touched them — literally."
world news,"The images of that day appeared in newspapers and on TV sets around the globe, focusing international attention on the then-languishing campaign to rid the world of devices that lurk underground for decades after conflicts end. Today, a treaty banning landmines has 164 signatories."
world news,"Diana’s walk among the landmines seven months before she died in a Paris car crash is just one example of how she helped make the monarchy more accessible, changing the way the royal family related to people."
world news,"Diana had the “emotional intelligence that allowed her to see that bigger picture … but also to bring it right down to individual human beings,” said James Cowan, a retired major general who is now CEO of The HALO Trust. “She knew that she could reach their hearts in a way that would outmaneuver those who would only be an influence through the head.”"
world news,"By interacting more intimately with the public — kneeling to the level of a child, sitting on the edge of a patient’s hospital bed, writing personal notes to her fans — she connected with people in a way that inspired other royals, including her sons, Princes William and Harry, as the monarchy worked to become more human and remain relevant in the 21st century."
world news,"And that began on the day the 20-year-old Lady Diana Spencer married Prince Charles, the heir to throne, on July 29, 1981, at St. Paul’s Cathedral."
world news,"Critically, she also knew that those interactions could bring attention to her causes since she was followed everywhere by photographers and TV crews."
world news,"Diana’s sons learned from their mother’s example, making more personal connections with the public during their charitable work, including supporting efforts to de-stigmatize mental health problems and treat young AIDS patients in Lesotho and Botswana."

She wasn’t ever going to be the one to give the right words. But she gave the right image.”"
world news,"Elizabeth Emanuel, who co-designed her wedding dress, describes an event comparable to the transformation of a chrysalis into a butterfly, or in this case a nursery school teacher in cardigans and sensible skirts into a fairytale princess."

world news,"Ten years before she embraced landmine victims in Angola, she shook hands with a young AIDS patient in London during the early days of the epidemic, showing people that the disease couldn’t be transmitted through touch."
world news,"As her marriage to Prince Charles deteriorated, Diana used the same techniques to tell her side of the story. Embracing her children with open arms to show her love for her sons. Sitting alone in front of the Taj Mahal on a royal trip to India. Walking through that minefield as she was starting a new life after her divorce."
world news,But Emanuel said Diana also had a simplicity that made her more accessible to people.
world news,"“We thought, right, let’s do the biggest, most dramatic dress possible, the ultimate fairytale dress. Let’s make it big. Let’s have big sleeves. Let’s have ruffles,” Emanuel said. “And St. Paul’s was so huge. We knew that we needed to do something that was a statement. And Diana was completely up for that. She loved that idea.’’"

world news,"Under a law passed in December, Ortega’s government has the power to unilaterally declare citizens “terrorists” or coup-mongers, classify them as “traitors to the homeland” and ban them from running as candidates."
world news,"Those accused “will be traitors to the homeland, and for that reason may not run for public office.” Treason is punishable by prison terms of up to 15 years."
world news,"Hours later, police barged into Torres’ home and arrested him."
world news,"On Saturday, police arrested Tamara Dávila, who was active in Unamos, a movement formed by former Sandinistas angered by Ortega’s autocratic ways, nepotism and perpetual re-elections. On Sunday, police also arrested Suyen Barahona, the leader of Unamos."
world news,"Torres said he has seen drones flying around his home in recent days, of the type used at Tellez’s house."
world news,"The law punishes those “who lead or finance a coup ... encourage foreign interference, ask for military intervention ... propose or plan economic blockades, applaud and champion the imposition of sanctions against Nicaragua or its citizens.”"
world news,"Tellez’s arrest is a major step: she was a leading Sandinista militant who led an assault on the National Palace in 1978, taking hostage the congress of dictator Anastasio Somoza in exchange for the release of Sandinista prisoners."
world news,"Ortega has already arrested four potential opposition candidates who might have challenged his bid for a fourth consecutive term, and now many Nicaragua opposition leaders fear it is only a matter of time until police come for them, too."
world news,Police said they arrested Dávila on charges related to a recently enacted law that classifies as treason any support for sanctions against officials in the Ortega regime; the U.S. has slapped sanctions on dozens of officials.
world news,"Davila is also a central figure in the opposition coalition Blue and White National Unity, which was formed following Ortega’s repression of mass protests in 2018."
world news,Nicaragua’s National Police arrested the four opposition pre-candidates earlier this month.
world news,"“This interview may be the last one I give,” Torres said. “I am here, waiting for them to come for me.”"
world news,"Julie Chung, the U.S. State Department’s acting assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere affairs, said via Twitter recently that the arrests “confirm without a doubt that Ortega is a dictator. The international community has no choice but to treat him as such.”"
world news,BANGKOK (AP) — Myanmar’s ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi was set to go on trial Monday on charges that many observers have criticized as an attempt by the military junta that deposed her to delegitimize her democratic election and cripple her political future.
world news,"The previous week authorities detained Cristiana Chamorro, a cousin of Juan Sebastián Chamorro, and Arturo Cruz Sequeira, a former ambassador to the United States."
world news,"Suu Kyi’s prosecution poses the greatest challenge for the 75-year-old and her National League for Democracy party since February’s military coup, which prevented them from taking office for a second five-year term following last year’s landslide election victory."
world news,"Human Rights Watch charged that the allegations being heard in a special court in the capital, Naypyitaw, are “bogus and politically motivated” with the intention of nullifying the victory and preventing Suu Kyi from running for office again."
world news,"Torres said Ortega has now instituted a more suffocating dictatorship than Somoza, who faced opposition from the within the church, intellectual circles and universities."
world news,"Ortega initially led Nicaragua from 1979 to 1990 following the Sandinista revolution that ousted Somoza. He returned to the presidency in 2007 after three failed election attempts, and he won reelection in 2011. He then sidestepped term limits to get himself reelected in 2016, and packed courts and government agencies with allies. The Sandinista party controls the courts and the legislature, and has stifled universities and the Roman Catholic church."
world news,"On June 8, they arrested pre-candidate Félix Maradiaga, a pre-candidate for the opposition coalition Blue and White National Unity, and Sebastián Chamorro, a former director of the opposition coalition Civic Alliance."
world news,"“I think Ortega has outdone Somoza,” said Torres. “He has subordinated all the power to himself as Somoza never could. He has a bigger repressive apparatus than Somoza ever had.”"
world news,"Suu Kyi is being tried on allegations she illegally imported walkie-talkies for her bodyguards’ use, unlicensed use of the radios and spreading information that could cause public alarm or unrest, as well as for two counts of violating the Natural Disaster Management Law for allegedly breaking pandemic restrictions during the 2020 election campaign, her lawyers said Sunday."
world news,"“This trial is clearly the opening salvo in an overall strategy to neuter Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy party as a force that can challenge military rule in the future,” said Phil Robertson, the organization’s deputy Asia director."
world news,"The army seized power on Feb. 1 before the new lawmakers could be seated, and arrested Suu Kyi, who held the post of special counselor, and President Win Myint, along with other members of her government and ruling party. The coup reversed years of slow progress toward more democracy for Myanmar."
world news,"“All these charges should be dropped, resulting in her immediate and unconditional release,” said Human Rights Watch’s Robertson. “But sadly, with the restrictions on access to her lawyers, and the case being heard in front of a court that is wholly beholden to the military junta, there is little likelihood she will receive a fair trial.”"
world news,"The junta has claimed it will hold new elections within the next year or two but the country’s military has a long history of promising elections and not following through. The military ruled Myanmar for 50 years after a coup in 1962, and kept Suu Kyi under house arrest for 15 years after a failed 1988 popular uprising."
world news,"Two other more serious charges are being handled separately. Suu Kyi is charged with breaching the colonial-era Official Secrets Act, which carried a maximum 14-year prison term, and police last week filed complaints under a section of the Anti-Corruption Law that states that political office holders convicted for bribery face a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison and a fine."
world news,The army cited the government’s failure to properly investigate alleged voting irregularities as its reason for seizing power — an assertion contested by the independent Asian Network for Free Elections and many others. Junta officials have threatened to dissolve the National League for Democracy for alleged involvement in election fraud and any conviction for Suu Kyi could see her barred from politics.
world news,"Although Suu Kyi faced her first charge just days after the coup, she was not immediately allowed to consult with her lawyers. Only on May 24, when she made her first actual appearance in court, was she allowed the first of two brief face-to-face meetings with them at pre-trial hearings. Her only previous court appearances had been by video link."
world news,"The military’s latest takeover sparked nationwide protests that continue despite a violent crackdown that has killed hundreds of people. Although street demonstrations have shrunk in number and scale, the junta now faces a low-level armed insurrection by its opponents in both rural and urban areas."
world news,"Government prosecutors will have until June 28 to finish their presentation, after which Suu Kyi’s defense team will have until July 26 to present its case, Khin Maung Zaw, the team’s senior member, said last week. Court sessions are due to be held on Monday and Tuesday each week."
world news,"A photo of her May 24 appearance released by state media showed her sitting straight-backed in a small courtroom, wearing a pink face-mask, her hands folded in her lap. Alongside her were her two co-defendants on several charges, the former president as well as the former mayor of Naypyitaw, Myo Aung."
world news,"The three were able to meet with their defense team for about 30 minutes before the hearing began at a special court set up inside Naypyitaw’s city council building, said one of their lawyers, Min Min Soe. Senior lawyer Khin Maung Zaw, said Suu Kyi “seems fit and alert and smart, as always.”"

world news,The American Cancer Societyestimates that a “woman’s risk of getting ovarian cancer during her lifetime is about 1 in 78” and “her lifetime chance of dying from ovarian cancer is about 1 in 108.”

world news,"Members of the Magdalen College Middle Common Room, or MCR, decided to take down the portrait during a committee meeting on Monday, according to the BBC. The outlet reported that the graduate students wanted to shelve the photo of the queen because “for some students, depictions of the monarch and the British monarchy represent recent colonial history.” "
world news,"Graduate students at the University of Oxford have removed a portrait of Queen Elizabeth from their common area because of its ties to “colonial history,” prompting cries of “cancel culture” and headlines around the world. "
world news,"“The Middle Common Room is an organisation of graduate students. They don’t represent the College,” she wrote. “A few years ago, in about 2013, they bought a print of a photo of the Queen to decorate their common room.” "

world news,Buckingham Palace had no comment for HuffPost on Wednesday. Oxford University and Magdalen College did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
world news,"Predictably, some people decried the students’ decision as “absurd” and proof of “cancel culture.”"
world news,"“She is the Head of State and a symbol of what is best about the UK,” he tweeted. “During her long reign she has worked tirelessly to promote British values of tolerance, inclusivity & respect around the world.” "
world news,Education Secretary Gavin Williamson called the removal of the portrait “simply absurd.” 
world news,"Other British universities have experienced backlash for any seeming tributes to the monarchy. King’s College London recently apologized for sending out a photo of Prince Philip following his death. After a number of complaints from critics of the Duke of Edinburgh, associate director Joleen Clarke told students and staff that the school was “sorry to have caused this harm.” "

world news,"MOSCOW (AP) — A Moscow court on Wednesday night outlawed the organizations founded by Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny by labeling them extremist, the latest move in a campaign to silence dissent and bar Kremlin critics from running for parliament in September."
world news,"The Moscow City Court’s ruling, effective immediately, prevents people associated with Navalny’s Foundation for Fighting Corruption and his sprawling regional network from seeking public office. Many of Navalny’s allies had hoped to run for parliamentary seats in the Sept. 19 election."
world news,"The ruling, part of a multipronged Kremlin strategy to steamroll the opposition, sends a tough message one week before President Vladimir Putin holds a summit meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden in Geneva."
world news,"The extremism label also carries lengthy prison terms for activists who have worked with the organizations, anyone who donated to them, and even those who simply shared the groups’ materials."
world news,"In a statement posted on his Instagram account after the verdict, Navalny denounced the hearing as a travesty of justice and vowed to continue defying the Kremlin."
world news,"“When corruption is the foundation of the government, fighters against corruption are cast as extremists,” the statement said. “We will not abandon our goals and ideas. It’s our country and we don’t have another one.”"
world news,"“The Russian people, like all people, have the right to speak freely, form peaceful associations to common ends, exercise religious freedom, and have their voices heard through free and fair elections,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement."
world news,"Navalny, Putin’s most ardent political foe, was arrested in January upon returning from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin — an accusation that Russian officials reject. In February, Navalny was given a 2 1/2-year prison term for violating the terms of a suspended sentence from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that he dismissed as politically motivated."
world news,"Lawyer Yevgeny Smirnov said during the hearing that the prosecutors’ motion was intended to bar Navalny’s associates from running for public office. “This case has been linked to the law that bans all those who are connected with the Foundation for Fighting Corruption from getting elected,” Smirnov said."
world news,"The U.S. State Department condemned the court’s ruling, saying that “Russia has effectively criminalized one of the country’s few remaining independent political movements.”"
world news,"The court session, lasting more than 12 hours, was held behind closed doors on grounds that classified materials would be discussed. The judge rejected a defense appeal to allow Navalny to take part via a video link from prison and dismissed other motions by the defense."
world news,"Navalny’s offices in dozens of Russian regions already shut down in April after prosecutors issued an injunction to suspend their activities pending the court ruling, but the opposition leader’s associates have vowed to continue their work in different formats."
world news,Lawyers said they would appeal the ruling.
world news,"His foundation, started 10 years ago, has relentlessly targeted senior government officials with colorful and widely watched videos that detail corruption allegations against them. One of its latest productions, which has received 117 million views on YouTube, claimed that a lavish palace on the shores of the Black Sea was built for Putin through an elaborate corruption scheme. The Kremlin has denied any links to Putin."
world news,Navalny also has relied on his offices across Russia to organize anti-Kremlin protests and implement his Smart Voting strategy — a project to support the candidates most likely to defeat those from the Kremlin’s dominant United Russia party in various elections.
world news,"During the hearing, prosecutors accused Navalny’s organizations of staging protests to overthrow the government."
world news,"As the Moscow court was preparing to consider the case, Russian lawmakers fast-tracked a measure that banned members of organizations declared extremist from running for public office. The law was signed by Putin last week, and combined with the court ruling will dash the hopes of several Navalny associates who have declared their intention to run for parliament."

world news,"The September vote is widely seen as an important part of Putin’s efforts to cement his rule ahead of the 2024 presidential election. The 68-year-old leader, who has been in power for more than two decades, pushed through constitutional changes last year that would potentially allow him to hold onto power until 2036."
world news,"Days before his arrest, Pivovarov announced the dissolution of his Open Russia movement to protect members from prosecution, but that didn’t stop authorities from pulling him off a Warsaw-bound plane at St. Petersburg’s airport last week. A court in southern Russia’s Krasnodar region ordered him to be held for two months pending an investigation."
world news,"Ahead of the vote, the government has targeted other opposition figures as well. Last week, authorities arrested Andrei Pivovarov, the head of another anti-Kremlin group that they have labeled “undesirable” — a designation used by the Kremlin to outlaw more than 30 groups."

world news,"Another opposition activist, Dmitry Gudkov, a former Russian lawmaker who has aspired to run again for the parliament, was held for two days last week on financial charges that he and his supporters allege were trumped up. He went abroad after being released, saying that he had received a warning that he would be jailed if he didn’t leave the country."
world news,El-Kurd said that the arrests are a “clear tactic of intimidation” that follows what he said is the Israeli forces’ “campaign of mass incarceration under the name of law and order” to suppress any resistance to the “colonial violence via home expulsions or home demolitions or bombing of innocent civilians.”
world news,"Mohammed el-Kurd, who since childhood has protested the Israeli occupation with his twin sister, Muna el-Kurd, spoke to Peacock TV’s Mehdi Hasan about, among other things, the 23-year-old siblings involuntarily becoming the global face of Palestinian resistance and thus being targeted by Israeli forces. "
world news,"Both Mohammed and Muna el-Kurd were temporarily detained by Israeli military forces on Sunday for leading protests against settlers trying to forcefully expel dozens of Palestinian families from their homes in the Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan neighborhoods of occupied East Jerusalem. Though the el-Kurds have spent most of their lives nonviolently documenting their struggles as Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah, both brother and sister went viral separately in the past month for their activism."
world news,"In February, the Jerusalem District Court ruled that residents of four houses in Sheikh Jarrah ― amounting to six families and 27 people ― could be forcibly evicted. The families appealed in the case that’s now made its way to the Israeli Supreme Court, which has been delaying a ruling but scheduled a hearing for July 20. Israel’s attorney general announced Monday that he would not intervene in the case, which human rights and civil rights groups say does not paint a positive outcome for other Palestinian families who have been threatened with expulsion."
world news,A Palestinian activist whom Israeli forces recently arrested and then freed said Monday that the international community must cut through propaganda and identify the continued expulsion of Palestinian families in East Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood for what it really is.
world news,"During the 1967 war, Israel captured and annexed East Jerusalem in a move that violated international law. The Israeli Knesset, or parliament, passed a law just three years later that allowed Jews who fled or were expelled from East Jerusalem in 1948 to reclaim their land ― a right denied to Palestinians who fled or were expelled from Israel during the same war. This means Israeli Jews can register as Sheikh Jarrah landowners, but Palestinian refugees who live there cannot do the same for their pre-1948 property, leading to forced evictions."
world news,"“There’s hundreds and hundreds of Palestinians that are working tirelessly on the ground ― journalists especially, and medics and activists that are doing just as much,” el-Kurd told Hasan. “We’re very grateful for the reach, and we hope that our voices can amplify the Palestinian cause and the fight for Palestinian liberation, but I also want to highlight the hundreds of Palestinians that have been arrested over the past week, the tens that were arrested just after my release. This is not an anomaly. It doesn’t begin or end with my sister and myself.”"
world news,"The expulsions are what helped ignite the deadly 11-day attack on Gaza last month. But despite Israel agreeing to a cease-fire with Gaza militant group Hamas, the Israeli government has continued its campaign to displace Palestinian families in East Jerusalem. The campaign is part of a system of Israeli laws working to increase the number of Jews and decrease the number of Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories ― a system that several human rights groups say meets the definition of apartheid."
world news,Israeli settlers have been carrying out the decades-long effort to remove families from densely populated Palestinian neighborhoods in the so-called Holy Basin just outside the walls of the Old City. Two Jewish religious associations purchased the land now known as Sheikh Jarrah in the late 19th century but never built on it. 
world news,"During the war of 1948 that followed Israel’s creation, Jordan took ownership of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, including Sheikh Jarrah. Because the war resulted in what’s known as the Nakba ― when about 700,000 Palestinians either fled or were expelled from their homes as a result of Israel’s statehood ― Jordan used the land now known as Sheikh Jarrah to settle Palestinian refugees and built homes there for 28 Palestinian families in 1956."
world news,"“It’s been very clear the Israeli propaganda machine, be it the attorney general or people bankrolled by the Israeli government, have been trying really hard to frame this as a ‘property dispute,’ as a ‘real estate dispute,’ to depoliticize the active state-sanctioned ethnic cleansing that is happening for us in Sheikh Jarrah, for people in Silwan, for people in Isawiya, for people in Jaffa, for people in Lifta,” el-Kurd said on “The Mehdi Hasan Show.”"
world news,"U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken had said that Palestinians in Sheikh Jarrah should settle the matter of their forced displacement in the Israeli courts. But such an idea is “inconceivable,” according to Mohammed el-Kurd."
world news,"“But it’s not apolitical. What’s happening is very political, because if it weren’t political, you wouldn’t have Israeli occupation forces assaulting and arresting journalists, removing medics from the scene. You wouldn’t have them detain Palestinian activists like my sister and myself. You also wouldn’t have prominent Israeli right-wing politicians set up their offices in Sheikh Jarrah. So this is clearly a legalized way of ethnic cleansing. It’s also happening in Silwan, where people are not dispossessed by U.S.-registered settler organizations, they’re dispossessed by the Israeli occupation municipality itself. Just because you can legalize an evil act doesn’t make it any less evil.”"
world news,"“It’s inconceivable for us to seek justice from our abusers,” he said. “I think the international community must hold Israel accountable and end its impunity.”"
world news,The el-Kurd family lost half of its property to settlers in 2009 after the two Jewish associations sold Sheikh Jarrah to a settler group owned by U.S.-based Nahalat Shimon International. Palestinian Sheikh Jarrah residents have reported experiencing violence and intimidation from new settlers. Now the el-Kurds face removal from the other half of their property.

world news,"The tax proposals endorsed Saturday have two main parts. The first part lets countries tax a share of the profits earned by companies that have no physical presence but have substantial sales, for instance through selling digital advertising. The G-7 statement echoes a U.S. proposal to simply let countries tax part of the earnings of the largest and most profitable companies — digital or not — if they are doing business within their borders.

world news,"CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) — South African President Cyril Ramaphosa announced Sunday that his country will return to stricter lockdown measures in the face of a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases that indicate the virus is “surging again” in Africa’s worst-affected nation."
world news,"Positive cases in South Africa in the past seven days were 31% higher than the week before, and 66% higher than the week before that, Ramaphosa said in a live TV address. He said some parts of the country, including the commercial hub Johannesburg and the capital city Pretoria, were now in “a third wave.”"
world news,"In response, Ramaphosa said that from Monday the nighttime curfew would be extended by an hour to start at 11 p.m. until 4 a.m. A maximum of 100 people would be allowed at indoor social gatherings and no more than 250 at an outdoors gathering. The number of people attending funerals will be limited to 100 people and after-funeral gatherings were banned completely, Ramaphosa said. Nonessential businesses must close by 10 p.m."
world news,"“We do not yet know how severe this wave will be or for how long it will last,” Ramaphosa said."
world news,"“We have tended to become complacent,” Ramaphosa said, warning virus infections were “surging again” at a time when the country moves into its winter months and people were more likely to gather together indoors, likely further increasing infections."
world news,South Africa’s decision to go back to a stricter lockdown reinforces — as the crisis in India has already done so starkly — how the global pandemic is far from over.
world news,"“We have seen in other countries the tragic consequences of leaving the virus to spread unchecked,” Ramaphosa said. “We cannot let our guard down.”"
world news,"South Africa had been under lockdown level one, the lowest of its five levels, but was now reverting to an “adjusted level two,” Ramaphosa announced. Authorities did stop short of reimposing the strict measures like limits on people’s movements during the day and a ban on the sales of alcohol and tobacco products that were in place at times last year."
world news,"South Africa has more than 1.6 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 56,000 deaths, more than 30% of the cases and 40% of the deaths recorded by all of Africa’s 54 countries, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. South Africa recorded 4,515 new cases over the past 24 hours and Ramaphosa said the “positivity rate” among tests conducted was now “a cause for concern.”"
world news,"Experts have warned that this wave, arriving with the Southern Hemisphere winter, might be even worse."
world news,"South Africa has seen two previous surges in infections, the first in the middle of last year and a second, much worse wave in December and January, when the emergence of a variant pushed infections and deaths to higher levels than the first surge. The virus was currently following “the same trajectory” as those waves, Ramaphosa said."
world news,"The surge in cases also cast more attention on South Africa’s lagging vaccine rollout. Only around 1.5% of the country’s 60 million people have received a vaccine. Health workers were the No. 1 priority but less than 500,000 of the 1.2 million health workers have been vaccinated with the Johnson & Johnson one-dose shot. South Africa only began vaccinating its elderly citizens two weeks ago. In total, 963,000 South Africans had received a vaccine by Sunday, the government said, although half of those have only received the first of two required doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine."
world news,"JERUSALEM (AP) — The head of a small hard-line party on Sunday said he would try to form a unity government with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s opponents, taking a major step toward ending the 12-year rule of the Israeli leader."
world news,"In a nationwide address, Yamina party leader Naftali Bennett said he had decided to join forces with the country’s opposition leader, Yair Lapid. The pair have until Wednesday to complete a deal in which they are expected to each serve two years as prime minister in a rotation deal."
world news,"South Africa has “secured” more than 50 million vaccines, Ramaphosa said, but currently has only 1.3 million doses in the country that are ready to be rolled out. More Pfizer-BioNTech doses are expected to arrive next week, and weekly after that, he said. South Africa hopes to vaccinate around 40 million people by the end of the year, a target that looks increasingly unlikely."
world news,"“It’s my intention to do my utmost in order to form a national unity government along with my friend Yair Lapid, so that, God willing, together we can save the country from a tailspin and return Israel to its course,” Bennett said."
world news,"A unity government would end the cycle of deadlock that has plunged the country into four inconclusive elections over the past two years. It also would end, at least for the time being, the record-setting tenure of Netanyahu, the most dominant figure in Israeli politics over the past three decades."
world news,He urged nationalist politicians who have joined the coalition talks not to establish what he called a “leftist government.”
world news,"In his own televised statement, Netanyahu accused Bennett of betraying the Israeli right wing."
world news,"“A government like this is a danger to the security of Israel, and is also a danger to the future of the state,” he said."
world news,"Bennett, a former Netanyahu aide turned rival, said he was taking the dramatic step to prevent yet another election. While sharing Netanyahu’s nationalist ideology, Bennett said there was no feasible way for the hard-line right wing to form a governing majority in parliament."
world news,"He said everyone “will need to postpone fulfilling all their dreams. We will focus on what can be done, instead of fighting all day on what’s impossible.”"
world news,"“A government like this will succeed only if we work together as a group,” he said."
world news,"Netanyahu is desperate to stay in power while he is on trial. He has used his office as a stage to rally support and lash out against police, prosecutors and the media."
world news,"Netanyahu, who has accused Bennett of betraying the Israeli right wing, planned a televised statement later Sunday."
world news,Each of the past four elections was seen as a referendum on Netanyahu ― who has become a polarizing figure as he stands trial on corruption charges — with each ending in deadlock.
world news,"If his opponents fail to form a government and new elections are triggered, it would give him another chance at seeing the election of a parliament that is in favor of granting him immunity from prosecution. But if they succeed, he would find himself in the much weaker position of opposition leader and potentially find himself facing unrest in his Likud party."
world news,"As leader of the largest party, Netanyahu was given the first opportunity by the country’s figurehead president to form a coalition. But he was unable to secure a majority with his traditional religious and nationalist allies."
world news,"In order to form a government, a party leader must secure the support of a 61-seat majority in parliament. Because no single party controls a majority on its own, coalitions are usually built with smaller partners."
world news,"After Netanyahu’s failure to form a government, Lapid was then given four weeks to cobble together a coalition. He has until Wednesday to complete the task."
world news,"Netanyahu even attempted to court a small Islamist Arab party but was thwarted by a small ultranationalist party with a racist anti-Arab agenda. Although Arabs make up some 20% of Israel’s population, an Arab party has never before sat in an Israeli coalition government."
world news,"Lapid already faced a difficult challenge, given the broad range of parties in the anti-Netanyahu bloc that have little in common. They include dovish left-wing parties, a pair of right-wing nationalist parties, including Bennett’s Yamina, and most likely the Islamist United Arab List."
world news,"But with Wednesday’s deadline looming, negotiations have kicked into high gear. Lapid has reached coalition deals with three other parties so far. If he finalizes a deal with Bennett, the remaining partners are expected to quickly fall into place."
world news,Lapid’s task was made even more difficult after war broke out with Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip on May 10. His coalition talks were put on hold during the 11 days of fighting.

world news,"The ruling party says it prevented as many as 400 million potential births, averting shortages of food and water. But demographers say if China followed trends in Thailand, parts of India and other countries, the number of additional babies might have been as low as a few million."
world news,"The fertility rate, or the average number of births per mother, stood at 1.3 in 2020, well below the 2.1 that would maintain the size of the population."

world news,The court ruled that the Anglo-Dutch energy giant has a duty of care to reduce emissions and that its current reduction plans are not concrete enough.
world news,The court said in an English language summary of its ruling that Shell is not currently in breach of its obligation to reduce emissions as the environmental groups argued because the parent company is tightening its emissions policy.

world news,Netanyahu has pushed back against calls from the Biden administration to wrap up the operation that has left hundreds dead. It marks the first public rift between the two close allies since the fighting began last week and could complicate international efforts to reach a cease-fire.

world news,"“To those who have taken some form of accountability, thank you for owning it. That is the first step towards justice and truth,” he said. “Yet what deeply concerns me is that practices like these — and even worse — are still widespread today. Then, and now, it’s bigger than one outlet, one network, or one publication.” "
world news,"William, the Duke of Cambridge, said in his own statement, released by Kensington Palace, that it was “welcome” that the network accepted the findings from Dyson’s investigation."
world news,"The duke’s comments come after Lord John Dyson, a former judge, conducted a months-long investigation into Bashir and the BBC’s conduct. Dyson’s findings, compiled in a 127-page report, concluded that the network “fell short of the high standards of integrity and transparency which are its hallmark.” "
world news,"“It is my view that the deceitful way the interview was obtained substantially influenced what my mother said,” the Duke of Cambridge said. “The interview was a major contribution to making my parents’ relationship worse and has since hurt countless others.”"
world news,"William said that BBC employees produced fake documents to secure Diana’s interview, “made lurid and false claims about the Royal Family which played on her fears and fueled paranoia,” and “were evasive in their reporting to the media and covered up what they knew from their internal investigation,” among other claims."
world news,"He added, “It brings indescribable sadness to know that the BBC’s failures contributed significantly to her fear, paranoia and isolation that I remember from those final years with her.” "

world news,"As for what happens next to A-76, Readinger said it will eventually melt and break apart. The question is, when and where?"
world news,"Christopher Readinger, the lead analyst for the USNIC’s Antarctic team, said the break was “not unexpected ... but it did come out of the blue, sort of.”"
world news,"That’s because icebergs breaking off of larger ice masses — or “calving,” as experts call it — is generally unpredictable, and crevasses aren’t always an indicator that something’s about to happen, Readinger told HuffPost on Thursday."
world news,"The iceberg, dubbed A-76, was spotted breaking away from the Ronne Ice Shelf in the Weddell Sea by a researcher with the British Antarctic Survey on May 13. The separation was confirmed by the U.S. National Ice Center (USNIC) using satellite images."
world news,"Ice calving, even at relatively large sizes, is not necessarily anything to be concerned about, so long as the ice sheet is considered to be in overall balance, which is when the amount of ice gained through snowfall is equal to the amount of ice lost through melting and iceberg calving, according to NASA."
world news,"The long block of ice is roughly 1,668 square miles in size, spanning 89 nautical miles on its longest axis and 14 nautical miles on its widest axis, according to the USNIC. (In comparison, the entirety of New York City’s land area is about 303 square miles.)"
world news,"A massive slab of ice, nearly six times the size of New York City, has broken off of an ice shelf in Antarctica, creating what is now the largest iceberg in the world, scientists recently announced."
world news,"“We could watch them for years and they won’t do anything and elsewhere there will be this perfectly solid ice shelf that will suddenly collapse unexpectedly,” he said."
world news,"A fragment of one formerly massive iceberg, B15, that calved around 20 years ago is still hanging around; another iceberg has been stopped in the same spot for the last 33 years, he said."
world news,"Like Readinger, Ted Scambos, a research glaciologist at the University of Colorado at Boulder, told Reuters that the breaking off of A-76 is likely not linked to climate change. Scambos also said it won’t raise the ocean level when it melts, since the ice was already in the water as part of a floating ice shelf."
world news,"A-76 could also travel northward, out to sea, and break apart with the help of waves, warming temperatures and meltwater on the ice’s surface that will percolate downward and fracture the ice, Readinger said."
world news,"For now, A-76 is the world’s biggest iceberg, taking the first place title away from the A-23A iceberg, which is about 1,498 square miles and also located in the Weddell Sea, according to the European Space Agency."
world news,"The icebergs in this region of the world are traditionally named according to the Antarctic quadrant where they originated. “A” represents the Weddell and Bellingshausen Seas, and 76 indicates that it is the 76th iceberg tracked by USNIC in that quadrant. An iceberg is given a sequential letter if it breaks off from a larger named mass. So, A-23A was first part of the glacier A-23, which split from Antarctica’s Larsen C ice shelf in 2017."

world news,"The Israeli military, I would learn later, had targeted our building for destruction and offered up a brief advance warning: They had taken out three buildings so far this week, warning residents and occupants sometimes minutes beforehand to get out.

And now, my Gaza City office — the place that I thought was sacrosanct and would go untargeted because both AP and al-Jazeera’s offices were located on its top floors — is a pile of rubble and girders and dust."
world news,"Many Gazans have fared worse. At least 145 of us have been killed since Monday, when Hamas began firing hundreds of rockets into Israel, which has pounded the Gaza Strip with strikes. In Israel, eight people have been killed, including a man killed by a rocket that hit in Ramat Gan, a suburb of Tel Aviv, on Saturday."
world news,"In our building, the clock in my head felt deafening as I ran out of the office. I ran down the 11 floors of stairs and into the basement parking garage. Suddenly I realized: My car was the only one there. All others had evacuated. I threw my belongings in the back, jumped in and drove off."
world news,"When I felt I was far enough away, I parked the car and got out, making sure I had a view of my building. I found my colleagues nearby. They were watching, waiting for what was next."
world news,"Nearby, our building’s owner was on the phone with the Israeli military officer who had told him to get the place evacuated. The owner was begging for a bit more time. No, he was told. That won’t be possible. Instead, he was told: Go back into the building and make sure everyone’s out. You have 10 minutes. You’d better hurry."
world news,"I turned toward our building to watch. I was praying that maybe, maybe it wouldn’t happen. I thought of the families that lived on the upper five floors of the building, below the media bureaus and above the offices on the lower floors. What would they do? Where would they go?"
world news,"At first, it looked like layers of something collapsing. I thought of a bowl of potato chips, and what might happen if you slammed a fist into them.

world news,"Standing with my colleagues about 400 meters (yards) away, I watched for a while and tried to process it all as the rubble started to settle. White smoke was overtaken by thick clouds of black smoke as the structure crumbled. Dust and pieces of cement and shards of glass scattered everywhere. What we knew so well was gone."
world news,"I thought of all of my hundreds of mementos that were now in splinters — including the 20-year-old cassette recorder I used when I first became a journalist. If I had had an hour, I would have grabbed everything."
world news,"Our building was gone and would not be coming back. Already, other things were happening that I needed to cover. You must realize: We journalists, we are not the story. The priority for us is not ourselves. It is to tell the stories of other people, those who are living their lives in the communities we cover."
world news,I wondered how long I should stay and watch. It was then that my years of instinct kicked in — the instinct of covering so much violence and sadness in the place that is my home.

world news,DALLAS (AP) — A Texas appeals court on Thursday upheld the murder conviction of a former Dallas police officer who was sentenced to prison for fatally shooting her neighbor in his home.
world news,A panel of three state judges ruled that a Dallas County jury had sufficient evidence to convict Amber Guyger of murder in the 2018 shooting of Botham Jean.
world news,The ruling comes in a case that drew national attention because of the strange circumstances and because it was one in a string of shootings of Black men by white police officers.
world news,"Jean, a 26-year-old accountant, had been eating a bowl of ice cream before Guyger shot him. She was later fired from the Dallas Police Department."
world news,"The appeals court justices did not dispute the basic facts of the case. Guyger, returning home from a long shift, mistook Jean’s apartment for her own, which was on the floor directly below his. Finding the door ajar, she entered and shot him, later testifying that she thought he was a burglar."
world news,"Guyger’sappealhung on the claim that her mistaking Jean’s apartment for her own was reasonable, and therefore, so too was the shooting. Her lawyer asked the appeals court to acquit her of murder or substitute in a conviction for criminally negligent homicide, which carries a lesser sentence."
world news,"Dallas County prosecutors countered that the error was not reasonable, that Guyger acknowledged intending to kill Jean and that “murder is a result-oriented offense.”"
world news,"The court’s chief justice, Robert D. Burns III, and Justices Lana Myers and Robbie Partida-Kipness concurred with prosecutors, disagreeing that Guyger’s belief that deadly force was needed was reasonable."
world news,"“That she was mistaken as to Jean’s status as a resident in his own apartment or a burglar in hers does not change her mental state from intentional or knowing to criminally negligent,” the judges wrote. “We decline to rely on Guyger’s misperception of the circumstances leading to her mistaken beliefs as a basis to reform the jury’s verdict in light of the direct evidence of her intent to kill.”"
world news,Defense attorneys could still ask the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals — the state’s highest forum for criminal cases — to review the appeals court’s ruling. A message to Guyger’s attorney was not immediately returned.

world news,"Only a fraction of India’s population will be able to afford the prices charged by private hospitals for the shot, experts said, meaning that states will be saddled with immunizing the 600 million Indian adults younger than 45, while the federal government gives shots to 300 million health care and front-line workers and people older than 45."
world news,"NEW DELHI (AP) — In hopes of taming a monstrous spike in COVID-19 infections, India opened vaccinations to all adults Saturday, launching a huge inoculation effort that was sure to tax the limits of the federal government, the country’s vaccine factories and the patience of its 1.4 billion people."
world news,"The world’s largest maker of vaccines was still short of critical supplies — the result of lagging manufacturing and raw material shortages that delayed the rollout in several states. And even in places where the shots were in stock, the country’s wide economic disparities made access to the vaccine inconsistent."
world news,"So far, government vaccines have been free, and private hospitals have been permitted to sell shots at a price capped at 250 rupees, or around $3. That practice will now change: Prices for state governments and private hospitals will be determined by vaccine companies. Some states might not be able to provide vaccines for free since they are paying twice as much as the federal government for the same shot, and prices at private hospitals could rise."
world news,"Since state governments and private players compete for shots in the same marketplace, and states pay less for the doses, vaccine makers can reap more profit by selling to the private sector, said Chandrakant Lahariya, a health policy expert. That cost can then be passed on to people receiving the shots, increasing inequity."
world news,"“There is no logic that two different governments should be paying two prices,” he said."
world news,Concerns that pricing issues could deepen inequities are only the most recent hitch in India’s sluggish immunization efforts. Less than 2% of the population has been fully immunized against COVID-19 and around 10% has received a single dose. Immunization rates have also fallen. The average number of shots per day dipped from over 3.6 million in early April to less than 2.5 million right now.
world news,"In the worst-hit state of Maharashtra, the health minister promised free vaccines for those ages 18 to 44, but he also acknowledged that the shortage of doses meant immunization would not start as planned on Saturday. States say the paucity of shots is one reason why immunizations have declined."
world news,"India thought the worst was over when cases ebbed in September. But mass gatherings such as political rallies and religious events were allowed to continue, and relaxed attitudes on the risks fueled a major humanitarian crisis, according to health experts. New variants of the coronavirus have partly led the surge. Deaths officially surpassed 200,000 this week, and the true death toll is believed to be far higher."
world news,"The country’s shortage of shots has global implications because, in addition to its own inoculation efforts, India has promised to ship vaccines abroad as part of a United Nations vaccine-sharing program that is dependent on its supply."
world news,"The federal government is buying half of those vaccines to give to states. The remaining half can then be bought by states and private hospitals to be given to anyone over 18, but at prices set by the companies."
world news,Indian vaccine makers produce an estimated 70 million doses each month of the two approved shots — the AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India and another one made by Bharat Biotech.
world news,"The federal government is buying shots at 150 rupees each, or $2. The Serum Institute will sell the shots to states at 300 rupees each, or $4, and to private players at 600 rupees each, or $8. Bharat Biotech said it will charge states 400 rupees, or less than $5.50 for a shot, and private players 1,200 rupees, or more than $16."
world news,"By comparison, the European Union paid $2.15 per dose for the AstraZeneca vaccine. The company says that price is discounted because the EU contributed to the vaccine’s development."
world news,"The strain is mounting on the Serum Institute, which in addition to being India’s main supplier is also a critical supplier of the U.N.-backed initiative known as COVAX, which more than 90 countries are depending on. The institute paused exports in March."
world news,"“The urgent demand for vaccines in India is bad for the rest of the world,” said Ravi Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at Cambridge University."
world news,Some experts warned that conducting a massive inoculation effort now could worsen the surge in a country that is second only to the United States in its number of infections — more than 19.1 million.
world news,"“There’s ample evidence that having people wait in a long, crowded, disorderly queue could itself be a source of infection,” said Dr. Bharat Pankhania, a senior clinical lecturer specializing in infectious diseases at Britain’s University of Exeter. He urged India to first stop the circulation of the virus by imposing “a long, sustained, strictly enforced lockdown.”"
world news,"Pankhania cautioned that immunization efforts alone would not help immediately stem the current spike of COVID-19, since shots “only start to bear fruit in about three months’ time.” Vaccination would help prevent future waves of infection, he said."
world news,"The first batch of Sputnik V vaccines, which India is importing from Russia, arrived Saturday evening. Russia has signed a deal with an Indian pharmaceutical company to distribute 125 million doses."
world news,"Given the urgent need for vaccines, some experts said rationing available doses is critical."
world news,"“Vaccines need to be delivered to the areas with the most intense transmission,” Gupta said, explaining that vaccines should be used as “emergency control measures” in specific regions of India rather than offering doses to all adults across the subcontinent."
world news,"Pankhania said the widely seen images of Indian virus patients gasping for air and smoke billowing from makeshift funeral pyres should spur rich countries to share their vaccines more freely. He criticized the approach taken by many Western countries that are attempting to vaccinate all citizens, including younger people at low risk, before sharing any doses."
world news,"“It is better globally to immunize all the (vulnerable) people that need to be protected rather than to immunize entire populations in only some countries,” Pankhania said."

world news,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Some have claimed she’s indulging a forbidden romance. More likely, loneliness compels her to seek company at Rio de Janeiro’s zoo."
world news,"Either way, a blue-and-yellow macaw that zookeepers named Juliet is believed to be the only wild bird of its kind left in the Brazilian city where the birds once flew far and wide."
world news,"Almost every morning for the last two decades, Juliet has appeared. She swoops onto the zoo enclosure where macaws are kept and, through its fence, engages in grooming behavior that looks like conjugal canoodling. Sometimes she just sits, relishing the presence of others. She is quieter — shier? more coy? — than her squawking chums."
world news,"Blue-and-yellow macaws live to be about 35 years old and Juliet — no spring chicken — should have found a lifelong mate years ago, according to Neiva Guedes, president of the Hyacinth Macaw Institute, an environmental group. But Juliet hasn’t coupled, built a nest or had chicks so at most she’s “still just dating.”"
world news,"Aside from Juliet, the last sighting of a blue-and-yellow macaw flying free in Rio was in 1818 by an Austrian naturalist, according to Marcelo Rheingantz, a biologist at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, and there are no other types of macaws in the city. The lovebirds featured in the 2011 film “Rio″ are Spix’s macaws, which are native to a different region of Brazil and possibly extinct in the wild."
world news,"Being boisterous with brilliant plumage helps macaws find each other in dense forest, but also makes them easier targets for hunters and animal traffickers. They’re often seen in other Brazilian states and across the Amazon, and it is suspected Juliet escaped from captivity."
world news,"Biologists at BioParque aren’t sure if Juliet’s nuzzling is limited to one caged Romeo, or a few of them. They’re not even certain Juliet is female; macaw gender is near impossible to determine by sight, and requires either genetic testing of feathers or blood, or examination of the gonads."
world news,"“They’re social birds, and that means they don’t like to live alone, whether in nature or captivity. They need company,” said Guedes, who also coordinates a project that researches macaws in urban settings. Juliet “very probably feels lonely, and for that reason goes to the enclosure to communicate and interact.”"
world news,"Either would be interference merely to satisfy human curiosity with no scientific end, biologist Angelita Capobianco said inside the enclosure. Nor would they consider confining Juliet, who often soars overhead and appears well-nourished."
world news,"“We don’t want to project human feelings. I look at the animal, and see an animal at ease,” Capobianco said, noting Juliet has never exhibited behavior to indicate disturbance, such as insistently pecking at the fence. “Who am I to decide it should only stay here? I won’t. It comes and goes, and its feathers are beautiful.”"
world news,"After more than a year of COVID-19 quarantine and travel bans, the appeal of roaming without restriction is evident to humankind. Macaws are used to flying great distances of more than 30 kilometers (20 miles) a day, Guedes said."
world news,"Last year, BioParquegave its macaws more space: a 1,000-square-meter (10,700-square-foot) aviary where they fly beside green parrots and golden parakeets to compose an aerial, technicolor swirl. It’s a massive upgrade from prior enclosures that were roughly 100 square feet. BioParque reopened to the public in March, after privatization of Rio’s dilapidated zoo and almost 17 months of renovations."
world news,"BioParque aims to feature species associated with research programs at universities and institutes. One such initiative is Refauna, which reintroduces species into protected areas with an eye on rebuilding ecosystems, and is participating with BioParque to start breeding blue-and-yellow macaws."
world news,"The plan is for parents to raise some 20 chicks that will receive training on forest food sources, the peril of predators and avoidance of power lines. Then the youngsters will be released into Rio’s immense Tijuca Forest National Park, where Juliet has been sighted and is thought to sleep each night."
world news,"After two decades of relative solitude, Juliet will then have the chance to fly with friends. Neves said Juliet could teach them how to navigate the forest, or even find a love of her own."
world news,"“Their role could be important in terms of ecosystem and reforestation. It’s a big animal with big beak that can crack the biggest seeds, and not all birds can,” said Rheingantz, the university biologist, who is also Refauna’s technical coordinator. “The idea is for it to start dispersing those seeds, complementing forest animals that can’t.”"
world news,"After some pandemic-induced delays, the project has slowly restarted and Rheingantz expects to release blue-and-yellow macaws into Tijuca park toward the end of 2022."

The Islamic militant group showed no signs of backing down and fired hundreds of rockets at Israeli cities."
world news,"In just three days, this latest round of fighting between the bitter enemies has already begun to resemble — and even exceed — a devastating 50-day war in 2014. Like in that previous war, neither side appears to have an exit strategy."
world news,But there are key differences. The fighting has triggered the worst Jewish-Arab violence inside Israel in decades. And looming in the background is an international war crimes investigation.

The Israeli army also shared footage showing a rocket impact between apartment towers in the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikva early Thursday, apparently sparking a large fire. It said the strike left people wounded and caused “significant damage.”"
world news,"Gaza’s Health Ministry said the death toll rose to 69 Palestinians, including 16 children and six women. Islamic Jihad confirmed the deaths of seven militants, while Hamas acknowledged that a top commander and several other members were killed."

world news,"Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, a military spokesman, said at least 14 militants were killed Wednesday — including 10 members of the “top management of Hamas” and four weapons experts. Altogether, he claimed some 30 militants have been killed since the fighting began."
world news,"More raids conducted early Thursday were aimed at several “strategically significant” facilities for Hamas, including a bank and a compound for a naval squad, the military said."
world news,"While United Nations and Egyptian officials have said that cease-fire efforts are underway, there were no signs of progress. Israeli television’s Channel 12 reported late Wednesday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Security Cabinet authorized a widening of the offensive."
world news,"The current eruption of violence began a month ago in Jerusalem, where heavy-handed Israeli police tactics during Ramadan and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers ignited protests and clashes with police. A focal point was the Al-Aqsa Mosque, built on a hilltop compound that is revered by Jews and Muslims, where police fired tear gas and stun grenades at protesters who threw chairs and stones at them."

world news,"His rivals have courted a small Islamist Arab party. But the longer the fighting lasts, the more it could hamper their attempts at forming a coalition. It could also boost Netanyahu if another election is held, since security is his strong suit with the public."
